            Early Normal Schools
            ASCENSION SEMINARY AND CAPTAIN WILLIAM T. CRAWFORD
            JOHN C. CHANEY of 
                        Sullivan
                    , Indiana
            In 1858 William T. Crawford of 
                  Lisbon, Ohio
               , a graduate of 
                        Lisbon
                     High School, fresh from his matriculation at Mount Union college, 
                        Ohio
                    , came to 
                  Farmersburg, Sullivan
                    county
               , Indiana, to visit relatives who had but recently
                    immigrated to 
                        Jackson
                     township–on a vacation and exploring trip. He farmed a
                    crop of corn about two miles north of Hymera during the summer of that year.
            While thus engaged he noted the lack of education and interest in education among
                    the people with whom he came in contact. When the few schools in the
                    neighborhoods in the fall assembled, he also noted the crudity of methods
                    pursued by the teachers of these schools.
            The next spring at the close of the short terms of school which then prevailed,
                    he opened a select subscription school in a private residence in 
                        Farmersburg
                     in which there was a spare front room about twenty feet square. In
                    this select school there were gathered together from surrounding country schools
                    and in the village of 
                        Farmersburg
                     twenty-seven young people–about equally divided between
                    males and females. This school continued for eleven weeks and adjourned to meet
                    again September 15th following. On assembling in September there were thirty-two
                    enrolled. The school awakened the people to education; and the fame of the
                    teacher spread for  many miles. There was at
                    the time a newspaper published at 
                        Sullivan
                    , county seat of 
                        Sullivan county
                    , whose editor interested himself in the educational demands of
                    western Indiana. The editor visited the 
                        Farmersburg
                     school, which visit resulted in an editorial in the newspaper,
                    recommending all teachers of 
                        Sullivan county
                    , "Before beginning their work for the school year, or if
                    any of them had already begun, to close their schools for a week, and attend the 
                        Crawford
                     school at 
                        Farmersburg
                    ."
            This the teachers generally did; and then and there was held an
                    "institute week" in connection with daily recitations in this
                    select school.
            It was yet early enough in the fall for the most of the institute sessions to be
                    held under a spreading oak tree standing on what afterward became Ascension
                    Seminary grounds. The then acting county "school examiner"
                    attended the institute and lent it his co-operation and support.
            It all resulted in a popular demand for a select school which would not only
                    impart instruction, but "train teachers how to teach."
            In 1860, from his own purse, Mr. Crawford, then but 22 years old, purchased a
                    small field lying at the western edge of the village of 
                        Farmersburg
                     as a "school grounds," and returned to his home
                    in 
                        Ohio
                    , where he married Elizabeth Conkle, a school mate of his in Mount
                    Union college.
            He raised a flock of sheep and taught a three months term of school in 
                        Ohio
                    . He disposed of the sheep, gathered together what money he could,
                    and took his wife with him to 
                        Farmersburg
                     to build a school building and found a Normal school. Upon landing
                    at 
                        Farmersburg
                     he found many enthusiastic friends in support of his enterprise,
                    and he proceeded to the erection of a two-story frame building 36 by 60 feet.
                    Meantime, the Civil war had begun, and the call for volunteers to save the Union
                    had gone forth. The young professor heard the call and answered it by raising
                    Company H of the 85th Indiana infantry, and soon went to the front, where, as
                    captain of his company, he served "full three long years of
                    warfare." His command distinguished itself in many of the hard-fought
                    battles of the rebellion.
            
            While in the service his seminary building stood weather-boarded and roofed but
                    not plastered. The army was no place for a fighting soldier to make money, and
                    money was needed to complete the building.
            He and his company were discharged soon after the surrender of Lee, and he came
                    home and applied himself, under limited means, to his school prospects with
                    assiduity, and so far completed the seminary building as to open school in it in
                    the fall of 1865.
            The post office at 
                        Farmersburg
                     was named Ascension, and this name he gave to his seminary.
                    Ascension Seminary became a worthy normal school in western Indiana, and was the
                    inspiration for the State Normal school at 
                        Terre Haute
                    .
            Before describing this honored school, a brief description of its founder,
                    Professor William T. Crawford, may be appropriate. He was born in 
                        Jay county
                    , Indiana, in 1837; his parents, Samuel and Gracy Crawford, of
                    Scotch-Irish stock, residing in Indiana about two years. He was reared in
                            
                  Columbiana county, Ohio
               , however, within six
                    miles of 
                        Lisbon
                    , the seat of government of the county. He was the sixth of a family
                    of ten children, six of whom were teachers. He was a man of striking
                    personality, stood five feet eleven inches in his stockings. His limbs were
                    slender but well shaped and muscular. His eyes were gray, his hair a
                    tawny-black, and he had a clear complexion. An aquiline nose and a fine face
                    completes his physical description. He wore a mustache and shaved his whiskers,
                    dressed in Prince Albert coat and plug hat and looked the cultured gentleman.
            In action he was dynamic, and his resolution of purpose made him the
                    personification of energy. He inspired his pupils; and every teacher who
                    emanated from Ascension seminary possessed his characteristics, imitated his
                    methods and manners, and, like himself, succeeded.
            It is noted above that his hair was black. However, he came of an ancestry which
                    grew gray early in life, and this inheritance, together with a spell of typhoid
                    fever in the army, made his hair white, while his mustache remained black, at
                    the time he founded Ascension seminary. His picture represents him at 70 years
                    of age, taken several years after he had retired from school work.
            
            Ascension seminary continued at 
                        Farmersburg
                     until 1872, when, because of inadequate equipment, it was by
                    arrangement with the school trustees of 
                        Sullivan
                     moved to 
                        Sullivan
                    , occupying the second and third stories of the recently completed
                    Central school building, where it continued to 1878, when Professor Crawford
                    retired and the seminary became merged with the high school of 
                        Sullivan
                    . The public schools of 
                        Sullivan
                     being united under one roof with the seminary, Professor Crawford
                    conducted both.
            With Professor Crawford there were associated, as assistant teachers, at 
                        Farmersburg
                    , Charles W. Finney, an army comrade; John T. Hays, a graduate of
                    Mount Union college, 
                        Ohio
                    , and A. P. Allen, a graduate of Depauw (Asbury) university. At 
                        Sullivan
                     were Professor Crawford, John T. Hays, A. P. Allen, W. H. Cain and
                    Amanda DeBaun, with several grade teachers and assistants.
            In connection with the regular school work there was a music department, under
                    direction of Professor and Mrs. Beazle; and also a literary society where
                    expression was taught in declamation, composition and debate, with a professor
                    as critic. For expression development the school was divided into three grand
                    divisions, each of which was subdivided into three classes which came on duty
                    every three weeks successively.
            To economize the time for study and recitation, the literary society met every
                    Friday night of the school year. The school year had three school terms of three
                    months each. The curriculum of the school embraced everything now covered in the
                    eighth grade of the public school and went thence beyond the present high school
                    course of the public school system, taking the range of two years of the present
                    college course of study. It embraced philosophy, physiology and hygiene,
                    grammar, English, history, ancient and modern, logic and mental philosophy. In
                    mathematics it embraced integral calculus, algebra to the nth degree, geometry
                    and trigonometry.
            The school taught Latin, Greek and German beside the English language. There was
                    no observatory; and the students studied the stars in pairs. Professor Crawford
                    taught German and mathematics; Professors Hays and 
                        Allen
                     taught Latin and English, and Professor Cain taught Greek. They  all taught elocution. Oratory was also a
                    specialty of the school. Professor Crawford was himself an orator.
            A feature of the school was mental arithmetic, which consisted in solving a
                    problem by oral analysis without the aid of the blackboard in stating and
                    solving the same.
            There were seven graduating classes which passed from Ascension seminary. There
                    were two thousand three hundred and seventy-eight teachers who sprang from this
                    institution, and there were many who entered the various professions and
                    avocations who did not complete the courses of study and therefore did not
                    graduate from the school. Judges, statesmen and diplomats were of this school,
                    and good citizenship abounded among them. It may well be said to be and to have
                    been an inspirational school of the normal type; and, in its day, served the
                    state and nation.
            The training received at Ascension seminary was practical and useful in every
                    calling. Physicians, ministers, lawyers, as well as those who followed gainful
                    avocations, who received their training in this worthy institution attest its
                    merit. It was, however, essentally a teachers' school; and its teachers
                    were everywhere and by everybody desired.
            Captain William T. Crawford reared a family of six children, four girls and two
                    boys. He lived out his days at 
                        Sullivan
                    , Indiana, in comfort, if not in plenty, and died in 1912, and
                    throughout his career was a true patriot, a good citizen and a great
                    "Normal Educator."
            Captain Crawford for many years was prominent in Grand Army
                    circles–attended and addressed Grand Army reunions and campfires in
                    Indiana, 
                        Illinois
                     and 
                        Ohio
                    . For several years his comrades depended upon him to "get
                    their pensions."
            He belonged to the Presbyterian church, was Sunday school superintendent, and a
                    deacon in the church. He was a republican in politics, yet he never held public
                    office. He belonged also to the Masonic fraternity.
            He was generally known and greeted as Professor Crawford throughout his life; and
                    his name and fame were conspicuous as the founder of Ascension seminary, whence
                    came the teachers whose services commanded the attention of the people of
                    western Indiana and eastern 
                        Illinois
                     for fifty years.

                    , James P. Goodrich of Winchester and Charles Evans Hughes for
                    information and material contained in letters and published articles; to the
                    county clerks of the counties mentioned in the tables used in this paper for the
                    information supplied at my request, and to Dr. Lawrence Henry Gipson, of Wabash
                    college, for his'assistance and kindly criticism in the preparation of
                    this paper.
            There has been much adverse criticism directed toward the direct primary system
                    in the past few years. Undoubtedly the primary has been used for a sufficiently
                    long period of years in a large majority of the states1 and
                    under widely enough varied local political conditions to allow practical and
                    theoretical students of politics to make an estimate of its actual worth. The
                    direct primary was brought forward by progressives in politics and is supported
                    by that class of political thinkers at the present time. Politicians of the old
                    school especially were opposed to its adoption, have supported it only in a
                    lukewarm manner, and now generally demand its repeal and a return to the old
                    convention system.
            It is necessary briefly to bring out the objections to most of the primary laws
                    of the several states. The expense to the candidates and to the state is an
                    important feature and it does not seem that any corrupt practice act yet enacted
                    has been able to eliminate this most serious objection. Again, one of the moat
                    complicated problems with which students of the primary are confronted is the
                    means by which members 
                  
                     1 According to a bulletin, issued in November,
                            1914, by the Indiana Legislative Reference Bureau, in 1914, forty states
                            had some kind of a primary election law. Thirty states included
                            mandatory and state-wide features. About sixty million people, or about
                            80 per cent of the population, choose their candidates for office
                            through some sort of primary election.
               
                     of one party can be prevented from entering
                    the primary of another party and naming the candidate–too often the
                    weakest man. The nonpartisan primary was offered by former Governor Hiram
                    Johnson of 
                        California
                     as a remedy for that evil. Such a law was twice enacted by the
                    legislature of that state and twice rejected by a referendum vote of the people,
                    or, as the Fresno Republican says: 
                        by such few of them as voted. On the face of it, it would seem that the
                            people of 
                                California
                             reject the theory but demand the practice of nonpartisan
                            primaries. However, the inconsistency may not be so great, since only a
                            few of them voted at the referendum elections, while a much larger
                            number voted at the actual primaries and insist on voting on a
                            non-partisan basis.2
                  
                    
            
            We find the same objections raised in 
                        Wisconsin
                     in the governor's message of 1919.3 It
                    says in part: 
                        No party organization can be maintained under it (the 
                                Wisconsin
                             law)–in fact it has again been demonstrated
                            within this state in the past year that the adherents of one party may
                            make an effort to nominate the candidate for another party in the hope
                            of giving their party a better opportunity for success.
                    
            
            Governor Emanuel Phillip believes that the convention is the proper agency to
                    name party candidates and platforms, and that the provisions of the 
                        Wisconsin
                     law providing that the candidates shall frame the platform is wrong
                    in principle and dangerous in practice.4
            
            In recent governors' messages much attention is focused upon the direct
                    primaries and the comment is usually unflattering. Governor Preus of 
                        Minnesota
                     declares it "absurd and politically dishonest";
                    Governor Hart of 
                        Washington
                     believes 
                        that time and experience have demonstrated that the direct primary is not
                            the rose-strewn pathway that leads to the political Utopia dreamed by
                            its sponsors

            Governor Warren T. McCray of Indiana in his message to the legislature of 1921
                    said of the primary: 
                        The present law is cumbersome and entails a necessary expense which no
                            man who seeks to serve his state or country in public office should be
                            forced to bear. I believe that the direct primary should be retained for
                            the selection of candidates for city, township and county officers and
                            also for the selection of candidates for precinct committeemen and
                            delegates to the state conventions.6
                  
                    
            
            He also recommended that candidates for 
                        United States
                     senator and governor, who are now chosen by the primary, providing
                    that one candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, and for congressmen,
                    state officials, and delegates to the national convention, be selected by a
                    party nominating convention.7
            
            It is significant to note that former State Senator Martin M. Hugg of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , a co-author of the Indiana primary law of 1907, says: 
                        I was a firm believer in primary reforms. It is ideal. But in practice,
                            in my opinion, it is a failure. As election commissioner of this (
                                Marion
                            ) county for three or four elections after the enactment of
                            the law of 1907 I had the very best opportunity to see its operations. I
                            then changed my opinion and now believe that the convention system with
                            delegates elected under proper legal provisions is the better. The
                            convention requires a majority to nominate. At a primary a plurality
                            does the work. Geographical conditions are also to be considered. By
                            this (the convention method) opportunity is given to nominate candidates
                            representative of the different elements of the party. In the end
                            tickets so nominated are better balanced than those selected at the
                            primary. 8

                  7 Several weeks later both houses of the Indiana
                        Legislature rejected a hill which incorporated these reforms by a very
                        decisive vote, and it is believed that the people of Indiana support the
                        action of their legislators rather than that of the governor and his
                        associates.

            It is not to be believed that the rank and file of the voters of either of the
                    major parties look with favor upon a return to the old convention system. In
                    this connection it may be pointed out that the primary laws of 
                        Wisconsin
                     have long been storm centers in legislative battles. The
                    pro-primary view there is expressed by the Capital Times,
                    which says: 
                        With the return of the old guard leaders to power a comprehensive and
                            nationwide attempt to smash the principle of the primary election is to
                            be made this winter (1920-1921). Reactionary forces throughout the
                            country have always hated the primary election law. They have magnified
                            its imperfections as an excuse to return to something infinitely worse
                            and more suited to the manipulation of the forces of reaction. 9
                  
                    
            
            The defenders of the primary system do not ordinarily claim that it is free from
                    imperfections, but do maintain that the members of the party should have the
                    privilege of nominating their party's candidates directly and without
                    unreasonable dictation from party leaders who can not be held legally or morally
                    responsible for that dictation. The views of the newer progressive elements in
                    both political parties are probably well expressed by Mrs. Esther Griffin White,
                    chairman of the 
                        Wayne County
                     (Indiana) Women's Republican committee, who says: 
                        Faulty as the primary law may be as at present constituted, it is a far
                            step ahead of the convention system. Nothing less than banditry is
                            played on the floor of conventions. The primary is a potent educational
                            factor, for example, this community saw and heard every candidate for governor and president during the last campaign.
                            If the primary was a big expense to the state it was money well spent.
                            There is nothing the matter with the primary law; it is all right. The
                            fault is in its administration, 10
                  
                    
            
            In former Senator Albert J. Beveridge of Indiana the primary has one of its most
                    able defenders. In an address at 
                        South Bend
                    , Indiana, Mr. Beveridge declared that the soundness of the
                    principle of primary elections can not be denied and that it has met with the
                    approval of the public. He charges that the movement to abolish it and to return

                     old convention system is the work of
                    practical politicians of both parties seeking personal advantages.11
            
            It is significant to note that few writers defend the primary laws of their
                    respective states in their entirety. Almost all admit imperfections and are
                    seeking reforms for their correction. Roughly, we may divide students of the
                    question into two classes, those who declare the principle of primary elections
                    inherently wrong and who demand a return to the convention system of nomination,
                    and those who maintain that the primary system is sound in principle and that
                    our efforts should be directed toward eliminating the faults and weaknesses. We
                    are not able to judge which view is preponderant, but the fact that there is
                    general dissatisfaction with the present primary laws seems to indicate that
                    some sort of reform is necessary and advisable.
            The practice of nominating candidates of political parties by representative
                    conventions has long been criticised. The first abandonment of the plan seems to
                    have been in 1860 in 
                  Crawford county,
                            Pennsylvania
               , where
                    the local political leaders agreed to the selection of candidates by popular
                    vote. The plan met with considerable favor and was tried locally in several
                    states, particularly in Indiana.12
            
            The first Indiana primary law was enacted by the legislature of 1901 and was
                    designed for the use of local units only.13 It provided that
                    counties containing cities of more than fifty thousand inhabitants might
                    nominate county, township, and city officers by direct primary, providing that
                    the party desiring to nominate its candidates in this way had cast ten per cent
                    or more of the total vote at the preceding general election. The use of this
                    method was thus made optional and the decision rested with the precinct
                    committeemen. The management of the machinery of the primary was left with the
                    party organization and the expense was borne by the party.14

                  14 Party officers formed the board of primary election
                        commissioners. It was also provided that two parties could not nominate
                        their candidates at the same time and at the same place. Corrupt practice
                        clauses, providing penalties for irregularities, were included, but as these
                        penalties were usually lighter
            
            
            The next law enacted in Indiana was in 1905 and was designed for 
                        Vigo county
                     only.15 It made mandatory the selection of
                    candidates for all county, township, and city offices and precinct committeemen,
                    and delegates to state and congressional conventions in counties containing
                    cities of over 36,500 inhabitants and less than 43,000 inhabitants by a primary
                    election. The expenses of the primary were paid by the county and a fee was
                    required to be paid by the candidate for nomination.16 In
                    the main the general election laws were applied, especially with regard to
                    irregular practices.17
            
            The first general mandatory law was passed in 1907 and provided for the
                    nomination of all county, township, and city officers, for precinct committeemen
                    and delegates to the congressional and state conventions, by a primary election
                    in counties containing cities of over 36,000 inhabitants. The law was optional
                    with counties containing smaller cities. The provisions were in general the same
                    as those enacted for 
                        Vigo county
                     the previous session.18 This is the first
                    primary law in Indiana which had a very general scope and was the result of a
                    public demand for reform in the nomination of candidates.19
            
            
                than those for similar abuses in general elections, and as the law
                        specifically provided that lack of regular form of ballots, poll books,
                        tally sheets, or other materials used was not sufficient cause for rejection
                        of the vote, it is difficult to see how these clauses had a very
                        far-reaching effect. The law also provided that counties containing cities
                        of less than 50,000 inhabitants might use the direct primary system,
                        provided the party organization so desired. In this case the secretary of
                        state was to be notified.

                  16 A candidate was required to file notice of his
                        candidacy not less than fifteen days nor more than twenty days before the
                        date of the primary election. The fee was twenty-five dollars for candidates
                        for offices paying more than five hundred dollars a year, and ten dollars
                        for those paying less than that amount.
               
                  17 In a letter of April 26, 1921, to the writer,
                        former Judge James E. Piety, of 
                            Terre Haute
                        , Indiana, says: "The good people of 
                            Vigo county
                         favored the passage of a primary law, thinking that it might
                        bring about the nomination and election of better officers. We tried it and
                        it did not prove a success. The general primary laws of the state have
                        proved a failure in 
                            Vigo county
                        . Our city and county officers are not as high class as they
                        were before the primary laws were enacted."
               
                  18 The board of primary election commissioners was
                        composed of the clerk of the circuit court, or of the city, according to
                        whether it was a county or city election, and a representative appointed by
                        him. The primary was held at the same place and time by each party
                        participating. Candidates were not required to pay a fee under the
                        provisions of this law.
               
                  19 The Governor's message of that year,
                        Indiana Senate Journal, 1907, p. 91, recommends simpler
                        and more comprehensive primary laws for the nomination
            
            
            In 1911 a general corrupt practices act was passed which applies to general and
                    primary elections alike.20 The penalties for tampering with
                    the machinery of elections were made much more severe and the placing of primary
                    elections on the same basis as general elections may be believed to have had a
                    very satisfactory effect on public opinion regarding the importance of the
                    primary.
            No changes were then made in the primary laws until 1915, when three very
                    important modifications were made.21 The law was made
                    state-wide and mandatory for all parties casting over ten per cent of the total
                    vote in the preceding general election. A preferential vote for president, 
                        United States
                     senator, and governor was provided, and in case any candidate for
                    any of these offices received a majority of the votes cast, the state convention
                    was required to declare him the nominee of the party, or, as in the case of a
                    candidate for president, that the delegates of the state vote for him as long as
                    his name was before the convention.22 A first and second
                    choice vote was also provided.23 This law again provided for
                    a small fee for candidates filing.24
            
            
                of all candidates for city, county, and township offices and delegates to
                        conventions. A bill was introduced by Senator Charles O. Roemler, of 
                            Indianapolis
                        , which was as sweeping in its scope as possible. All
                        conventions, even state, were abolished, and the state officers were to be
                        nominated by the primary method. The state central committee was to draft
                        the party platform. On second reading Senator Martin M. Hugg, of 
                            Indianapolis
                        , offered a substitute bill which was substantially the same as
                        the bill finally enacted. The mandatory feature applied to only five
                        counties, 
                            Marion
                        , Vanderburg, 
                     Allen,
                                St. Joseph
                   and 
                            Vigo
                        . After several hours debate a Republican caucus was held and
                        Senator Hugg was appointed chairman of a committee to sponsor the bill,
                        which was approved by the caucus. Letter from Senator Hugg, May 24, 1921

                  22 This was usually interpreted to mean as long as he
                        had a reasonable chance for nomination.
               
                  23 The following procedure was provided for the
                        counting of first and second choice votes: A candidate was nominated if he
                        received a majority of the first choice votes cast. If no candidate was thus
                        nominated the one having the least number of first choice votes was dropped
                        and the second choice votes of his supporters were added to the first choice
                        votes of the candidate for whom cast. If no candidate then had a majority
                        the porcess was repeated until a majority was obtained for some candidate.
               
                  24 For offices paying less than a hundred dollars a
                        year a fee of one dollar was required, and for those paying more than that
                        amount 1 per cent, of the yearly salary was provided.
            
            
            An amendment to this law was enacted in 1917 which abolished the second choice
                        vote.25 That feature of the 1915 law was not popular
                    with the people or with the party leaders and its repeal was generally demanded.
                    It is difficult to say what influence the second choice vote had in the one
                    election in which it was used, but it is believed that this was not great.26
            
            Only one important change was made in the primary law by the 1921 session of the
                    legislature. Independent candidates, so-called "soreheads,"
                    are prohibited from filing as candidates for election after a primary has been
                    held. The courts have not yet handed down a decision on this law and it is Aot
                    definitely known whether this excludes all independent candidates or only those
                    who were candidates in the primary.
            We have seen that the primary laws in Indiana have been far from static and a
                    study of their operation is made particularly hard for this reason. However, the
                    law has not been dianged materially in the past five years and we are able to
                    discover some very striking facts. Mr. Charles Kettleboro, director of the
                    Indiana legislative reference bureau, has made a very interesting study of the
                    operation of the 1916, 1918, and 1920 primaries.27 For these
                    three years there were 1,049 offices to be filled, and candidates for 623, or
                    59%, had no opposition. In the Democratic party in 1916, 40% were unopposed, in
                    1918 60%, and in 1920 65%. In the Republican party in 1916, 46% were unopposed,
                    in 1918 62%, and in 1920 56%. As Mr. Kettleboro points out, we may safely accept
                    as the basis of our study that where a candidate has no opposition he is either
                    brought out by the machine or is favored by it. If this were not the case the
                    party leaders would bring some one out in opposition to him. Thus we see from
                    the above figures that the majority of the ticket in most cases is probably not
                    named by the people in the operation of the primary, but by the party leaders. I
                    do not mean to say that this opportunity is abused by them, or that incompetent
                    or vicious candidates are always thrust upon the people by these

                     26 Mr. Charles Kettleboro, director of the Indiana
                            legislative reference bureau, believes that the second choice vote was
                            not given a fair trial, and that its repeal at that time was
                            unfortunate.

                     leaders, but we must recognize that in very
                    many cases the people do not name the ticket.28
            
            In this state the precinct committeemen are the basis of the organization of
                    political parties. They elect the county chairmen, who in turn elect the
                    district chairmen. The thirteen district chairmen compose the state central
                    committee and elect the state chairman. It is obvious that a control of the
                    precinct committeemen will eventually lead to a control of the entire political
                    machinery of the state. We have the following figures for 
                        Marion county
                     which show the lack of opposition for these important party
                        offices:29

            The writer had hoped to be able to present figures from all of the counties in
                    the state and discover how far this same condition prevailed in local politics.
                    Due to errors in the records, incomplete records, and the failure to get
                    information from the clerks of the circuit courts, only the following incomplete
                    table could be compiled, yet we can discover from it the same general tendencies
                    in most of the counties.30
            
            
               
                  28 This fact is also borne out by a little incident
                        that was called to my attention. The authenticity of it cannot be vouched
                        for, yet I will present It for what it is worth, as it comes from a reliable
                        source. Thirty minutes before the balloting began in the Republican state
                        convention, in May, 1920, a newspaper reporter walked thru the assembled
                        delegates in Tomlinson Hall, 
                            Indianapolis
                         and asked many of them who was going to be nominated for a
                        certain state office. Invariably the reply was: "I don't
                        know; the 'dope' hasn't come down yet."
                        We may well believe from this that to some degree at least the people did
                        not nominate the state ticket, thru their properly elected delegates, but
                        that the work was really done by some one higher up, who handed down the
                        "dope."
               
                  29 Mr. Kettleboro, in the National
                            Municipal Review, March, 1921.
               
                  30 There are undoubtedly errors in this table, as all
                        of the information with the exception of 
                     Fountain, Monroe
                   and 
                            Mbntgomery
                         counties was obtained by letter from the clerks of the circuit
                        courts. The information from 
                            Monroe county
                         was obtained from Dr. Frederic H. Guild, Instructor in
                        Political Science in Indiana university, and that for 
                            Fountain
                         and 
                            Montgomery
                         counties waa obtained by the writer personally. It must be
                        remembered that we know nothing of the local political conditions, which
                        always affect the contests for nomination. The insufficiency of these
                        figures is realized, and yet it is hoped that they may indicate the general
                        tendency.

                  32 No record for these years.
            
            
            As was seen, the per cent of local offices uncontested was 70.9, and that of
                    state offices 59. In nine of these local primaries 90% of the candidates were
                    unopposed, in seventeen 75% were unopposed, in twenty-seven over 50% were
                    unopposed, and in only nine were there contests for all offices. These figures
                    seem to indicate that there is the same tendency in local offices as in the
                    state offices. In many instances, as was suggested, the leaders of the party
                    name the ticket.33 Thus we have practically the Hughes plan
                    in operation in Indiana without proper legal machinery for its use.34
            
            The following table shows the per cent of unopposed candidates in these counties
                    and the expense of the primary there.

            It is unfortunate that the Indiana law provides that the primary election records
                    for local offices need only be kept for six months. Not only is this likely to
                    lead to irregularities, but it is almost impossible as a result to collect such
                    information for Indiana as we have from 
                        Iowa
                    . There should be a change in our law requiring that these records
                    be kept permanently.
            Thus we find that we are spending a total of $606,490.93 in these counties for
                    which the records are complete for the years 1916 and 1918 for the nomination of
                    candidates of whom about seventy per cent for local offices are unopposed, and
                    fifty-six per cent for state offices. Of course, there is the provision in the
                    state laws that where there is no opposition there is no primary held, but there
                    is usually some opposition and the total expense of the primary must be borne
                    for the nomination of these few candidates where there is opposition. In the
                    majority of these instances it appears to be not a question 
                  
                     33 The clerk of the 
                                Fountain
                             Circuit Court said that the last day for filing for one
                            primary there were no Democratic candidates filed. A group of party
                            leaders assembled In a law office across the street from the court house
                            and made a ticket and filed it. This was done thru no desire to dictate
                            the ticket, but from a desire to see that the party had a ticket in the
                            field.
                  
                     34 We are not able to say how far this situation
                            holds true in other states, but we present the following table by Mr.
                            Prank Edward Horack, as printed in the 
                        
                                    Iowa
                                 Journal of History and Politics, of January, 1921,
                            which shows the same general tendencies in 
                                Iowa
                            :
               
                     of the fitness of the candidates for the
                    office and the public would be served equally well by either candidate. Indeed,
                    many times it is a struggle between two local leaders for control of the party
                    organization and the candidacy for these local offices is merely expresesive of
                    that struggle. Yet we spend thousands of dollars in these contests and for
                    ratifying the choice of unopposed candidates. We may well ask ourselves how
                    important these elections are to good government in the community and to the
                    proper conduct of public business.
            Another serious defect in our primary law referred to at the beginning of this
                    article is the inability of one party to keep the members of another party from
                    coming into the primary and helping to nominate its candidates.35 One of the most flagrant examples of this was in the recent city
                    primary of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , where Samuel Lewis Shank was nominated as the Republican candidate
                    for mayor. Political experts of the city estimate that fully twenty thousand
                    Democrats voted in the Republican primary and that almost all of these votes
                    went to Mr. Shank, as it was rather generally admitted that he would be the
                    weakest candidate and the least desirable to the Republican organization.36 No satisfactory plan has as yet been devised in Indiana
                    whereby we may insure that such abuses of primary legislation will not occur.
            In considering this question of primary reform we have one very decided handicap
                    always with us which we must recognize. Former Governor James P. Goodrich of
                    Indiana stated it as follows: 
                        It is very difficult to frame any sort of legislation that can control
                            the election that will be automatic in its application and will make up
                            for the appalling neglect of the average citizen to give any time to
                                politics.37
                  
                    
            
            The percentage of qualified voters who cast their ballots in the 1916, 1918 and
                    1920 primaries well illustrates this lack of interest. In the Democratic party
                    in 1916, 50% voted, in 1918 47%, and in 1920 32%. In the Republican party in
                    1916 62% voted, in 1918 46%, and in 1920 67%.
            
               
                  35 No expense records are available as yet for 1920.

                        election laws are not designed for nonpartisan nominations. Their sole
                        object is to regulate nominations by political parties. No well disposed
                        person would seek to intrude into an organization whose principles he
                        disapproves.
               
                  36 In the seventh ward Shank received 372 more votes
                        than did Mr. Harding in the last presidential election. There were also two
                        other candidates for mayor, and the presidential election of last fall was a
                        Republican landslide, so these figures are very significant. The figures
                        from several of the other wards are also indicative of the fact that
                        Democrats must have voted in this Republican primary.

            BIG SPRING
                    OR MARENGO
            
            On April 15th, 1839, David Stewart deposited in the recorder's office at 
                        Fredonia
                     the plat of Big-Springs. This plat contained what is now called old
                        town.1
            
            Henry Hollowell squatted on the site of Marengo, or Big Springs, in 1811. Later
                    Stewart bought him out and built his home there. Soon Malachi Monk moved into
                    the county and with the assistance of the other men built the old block house
                    about 1812. There were many Indians prowling around then, but one finds no
                    record of any conflict between the whites and the red men. The block house,
                    which was two stories high, was built of logs. The upper story projected out
                    beyond the lower story so that the settlers could fire down on the Indians and
                    give them a reception that they would remember awhile. The old building was torn
                    down about the time of the Civil war.2 One may see the
                    foundations of it near the home of J. E. Ross, on the Marengo and Milltown pike,
                    about one mile east of Marengo. David Stewart bought the farm from the
                    government in April, 1833. Mr. Stewart, who was a minister, was in much demand
                    then. He assisted the two Kinkaid brothers to establish the first Christian
                    church in the county. This church was formally organized in October, 1819, in
                    the little log house of the Mr. Kinkaid over on Dog creek near the present town
                    of English. At first there were thirteen members.3
            
            The town of Big Springs never grew very rapidly. The town was located fourteen
                    miles from Leavenworth on the Leavenworth and Paoli road. The first post office
                    was at 
                        Proctorsville
                    , about one mile east of the town, where the home

                     of J. W. Birds was at the date of this
                    writing. It remained there until 1851, when a committee composed of Dr.
                    Mattingly, Hugh Taylor, Robert Walts, D. S. Tucker and M. T. Stewart was
                    appointed to arrange for moving it. A new name being necessary, Dr. Mattingly
                    suggested the name of Marengo. The post office was moved from 
                        Proctorsville
                     into Big Springs about 1851.4
            
            William Henry Harrison of Corydon visited David M. Stewart once and cut his name
                    on the body of a sugar tree which stood in the yard before Stewart's
                    cabin. Many years later an academy was built near the site of the cabin. The
                    sugar tree still stood there till about 1880, when it fell down."
            Marengo became a noted place during the Civil war. The settlers were Union
                    through and through. They allowed no one to wear a butternut badge into the
                    town. One day a man named David Miller came into the town armed with two
                    revolvers and a long-barrel rifle. He had on the butternut badge which the loyal
                    people of the town hated so much. He came for trouble and found what he was
                    after. As he walked down the street of the little town several men saw the
                    badge. He went into Stewart's gun shop and was standing there when Ben
                    Goodman and W. J. Stewart walked into the shop. Goodman had been wounded in the
                    battle of Stone's river and was at home now on a
                    furlough. Stewart jerked the badge off of Miller's breast and Ben
                    Goodman hit him over the head with a pair of knucks before had had a chance to
                    shoot or even draw his gun. Before the fight was over Miller was almost killed.
                    He managed with the help of some of the citizens to get home some way. When
                    Hines came through Marengo Miller hoped to get revenge. He went to Hines and
                    wanted to give him information which would have been very injurious to the
                    Union, but Captain Hines looked on him with suspicion. One of the rebels stepped
                    up to him and took his gun and drew back to knock his brains out but Hines
                    interfered and prevented the man from hitting him. Then the rebel looked at him
                    for a few minutes and said, "You say that you are for the South. Why in
                    the h– don't you go south and fight for

                    and rode away leaving Miller standing there.6
            
            At the time of the Civil war the town of Marengo was a village of log cabins
                    situated on Brandy branch and on Whiskey Run creek.
            ALTON
            
            On the banks of the beautiful Ohio river just a few rods
                    below where Little Blue river runs into the 
                        Ohio
                     lies the town of Alton. The town was platted by James Gaither and
                    recorded in the recorder's office at 
                        Fredonia
                     July 5, 1838. For a long time this town was called 
                        Nebraska
                    , the name of Alton has been used since 1850. The town never grew
                    very large. Probably there never was over three hundred people in the town at
                    its greatest size. During the Civil war the little town made a good record and
                    furnished so many men that the draft never was needed there.7
            
            ENGLISH
            
            The first man who bought land in the vicinity of English was Moses Smith, who
                    bought the east half of the northwest quarter of section 24, township 2 south,
                    range 1 west. Here there were three forks of Little Blue: namely, Camp fork, Dog
                    creek, and Brownstown fork. Later other settlers came and a town was built. W.
                    W. Cummins made the first plat of the town in 1839. It was recorded at 
                        Fredonia
                     on February 4, 1840, by the name of Hartford. After the town was
                    incorporated in 1886 the name was changed to English in honor of William H.
                    English who was elected to congress from that district in 1850, and was 
                        Hancock
                    's running mate in 1880.9
            
            At the time of the Civil war Hartford was a struggling village of a few log
                    cabins and one or two little stores. Her war record will be told in the
                    subsequent work on the county history.

            MILLTOWN
            
            Milltown which for a long time was called Leavenworth's Mill was platted
                    about 1837 by Seth M. Leavenworth. In that year Manual Schoonover secured a
                    license to sell foreign goods in the town of Milltown.10
            
            The plat of the town as submitted in the text was extended by other citizens. The
                    town grew rapidly and by the Civil war was one of the important towns of the
                    county. A plat of the town is given here. On the old plat made by Leavenworth
                    there are two still houses shown.11
            
            MAGNOLIA
            
            Magnolia was located about four miles northwest of Leavenworth on the Hartford
                    road. Addison Williams bought the southwest quarter of section 14, township 3
                    south, range 1 east, on February 19,1820. He tried to plat a town called 
                        New Haven
                     but the town never grew. So he filed the plat of Magnolia with the
                    county recorder on the fourth day of July, 1838. Magnolia soon had a still
                    house, a store, and a blacksmith shop. The buhrstones of the old mill may still
                    be seen in the outer part of the town. By the time of the Civil war the town had
                    grown to have a population of about 100 people.
            EARLY ROADS
            
            The people needed good roads in the pioneer days of 
                        Crawford county
                    . The towns of 
                        Fredonia
                     and Leavenworth were the points at which almost all the freight for 
                        Crawford county
                     was landed. There was a large river traffic on the 
                        Ohio
                     in those early days.1
            
            The oldest road in 
                        Crawford county
                     was the "Governor's Old Trailor
                    "trace". Governor Harrison and the settlers used this road
                    when they traveled from Corydon to 
                        Vincennes
                    . The Old Trail or Trace called the Old Wall at times was not much
                    of a road then. It must have been cleared of trees at the least. This road
                    entered 
                        Crawford county
                     near Sharptown,

                     passed near the old poor farm which was
                    located about one mile north of 
                        Martin
                        Scott
                    's farm, thence to the Leavenworth and Paoli road near
                    Pilot Knob, thence to Mount Sterling, passed near English and from there to 
                        Vincennes
                    . Parts of this old road are still in use while many changes have
                    been made in other parts of the road during the last seventy-five years. Map 4
                    shows the location of all these roads drawn as well as the author can from the
                    data at hand.2
            
            That part of the Old Wall which lay between the 
                        Salem
                     and Leavenworth and Paoli roads was declared a state road in 1836
                    by the state law. Later it was changed so that it included that part between the
                    Paoli road and the Jasper road.3
            
            The General Assembly provided for the Leavenworth and Jasper road in 1833. James
                    Glenn and Benjamin Roberson of 
                        Crawford county
                     were appointed commissioners to view out and locate the road. This
                    road was built up the river hill just below the Big 
                        Spring
                     branch in the town of Leavenworth. One who has not seen the hill
                    here cannot form any idea of the work required to build such a road. After about
                    eighty years the trace of the old road remains. After the Civil war changes were
                    made in the road and this portion up the big hill is not used any longer. It ran
                    for about one mile up the river hill at 
                        Leavenworth
                     before it reached the top of the plateau. This road can be easily
                    traced today.4 In certain places the road ran through dense
                    forests. The law required that the road be cleared from trees and underbrush and
                    made thirty feet wide. This cleared strip of land may yet be seen in certain
                    parts of the forest near 
                        Leavenworth
                    . The men met at 
                        Leavenworth
                     on the first Monday in March, 1833, and located the road. The board
                    doing county business ordered the road opened. The same law provided that Thomas
                    Fleming of 
                        Crawford county
                     should act in conjunction with George Arnold of 
                        Harrison county
                     and Joseph Enlow of 
                        Dubois county
                     in locating a road from Milltown to Jasper. These men met at 
                        Milltown
                     on the first Monday 
                  
                     2 Information furnished by M. C. Froman, County
                            Commissioner of 
                                Crawford county
                             for many years.

                     of March, 1833, and located the Milltown
                    and Jasper road as shown on the map for the roads. The board doing county
                    business ordered the road opened and paid for out of the three per cent, funds a
                    large portion of which was due 
                        Crawford county
                    .
            The law further provided that Joseph Denbo and James Sloan of 
                        Crawford county
                     should be appointed to help William Harris of 
                        Martin county
                     locate a road from 
                        Leavenworth
                     to Mount Pleasant in 
                        Martin county
                    . As far as the information can be obtained this road followed the 
                        Leavenworth
                     and Jasper road across the county.
            Another very important road which was opened in 1832 ran from 
                        New Albany
                     through Corydon, 
                  Leavenworth, Fredonia
               , and 
                        Perry county
                     to 
                        Princeton
                    . The road entered 
                        Crawford county
                     at the Cole's big bridge over Big Blue
                    river. John L. Smith of 
                        Leavenworth
                    , who was appointed commissioner of the road, did not want this road
                    to run through the town of 
                        Fredonia
                    . He was to locate the road from 
                        Leavenworth
                     to Hallie Goad's farm about ten miles west of 
                        Leavenworth
                    . The General Assembly provided by a subsequent act that Smith must
                    run the road through 
                        Fredonia
                     which was one of the points mentioned in the original law. A part
                    of the act reads as follows: 
                        And whereas much dissatisfaction prevails among the citizens in
                            consequence of an expressed determination of the commissioner to change
                            the road so that it will not run through the town of 
                                Fredonia
                            . On that account be it further enacted that John L. Smith
                            of 
                                Leavenworth
                             shall not be permitted to make any change so as to prevent
                            its passing through the town of 
                                Fredonia
                             but shall be governed by the original law which makes 
                                Fredonia
                             one of the points through which the road was to pass.
                    
            
            At that time there was a struggle going on between the two towns of 
                        Fredonia
                     and 
                        Leavenworth
                    . Each wanted the county seat. The above quotation shows how 
                        Leavenworth
                     was prevented from running the road about two miles north of 
                        Fredonia
                    . Out of justice to Smith one ought to say that the town of 
                        Fredonia
                     was out of the way about two miles. The map of the roads will show
                        this.5

            One may trace out the 
                        Salem
                     road on the map. The General Assembly enacted a law on January 8,
                    1835, which provided for the road. Zebulum Leavenworth represented 
                        Crawford county
                     in locating and marking out the road which ran through Milltown.
                    During the Civil war Captain Hines led his band of Confederates down this road
                    to 
                        Leavenworth
                    .7
            
            The 
                        Leavenworth
                     and Paoli road ran north from 
                        Leavenworth
                     to Cole's farm, thence to Red House's farm,
                    thence to Archibald's schoolhouse and on to Marengo, and thence to
                    Valeene and Paoli. This road has been relocated in many parts. Part of it can be
                    seen running north where the 
                        Leavenworth
                     and Marengo pike crosses the Southern railroad just south of
                    Marengo.
            The 
                        Fredonia
                     and Rome road was opened about 1832. This road was to be twenty
                    feet wide. It ran from 
                        Fredonia
                     southwest to 
                        Perry county
                    , passing out of the county about two miles north of the mouth of
                        Little Blue river and the town of Alton. When Hines
                    invaded the county in 1863 he entered 
                        Crawford county
                     over the Rome and 
                        Fredonia
                     road.8
            
            Many more roads were opened up by the commissioners in these early days, one of
                    which ran from 
                        Fredonia
                     to Mount Sterling. Zebulum Leavenworth and Seth Leavenworth were
                    the overseers on this road. Cornelius Hall and William Riley were to assist Seth
                    Leavenworth to open up a road from the Governor's Old Trail to the
                    Three Forks of Little Blue river. Part of this road became
                    the 
                        Leavenworth
                     and Jasper road and part of the northwest portion became the 
                        Leavenworth
                     and the Hartford road. Hartford was situated at the Forks of
                        Little Blue river and much later became the town of
                        English.9
            
            Another historic road ran from 
                        Leavenworth
                     to the western boundary of 
                        Crawford county
                    . Here it formed a part of the road running from Rome to Paoli. It
                    passed Robert Yates' farm and entered Hartford, from thence to Paoli.
                    Robert Yates helped locate this road in 
                        Crawford county
                    .10
            
            About 1832 the board doing county business divided the county into districts so
                    that the road supervisors could do

                        Leavenworth
                     clay turnpike was authorized by the General Assembly in 1829.
                    Julius Woodford, John L. Smtih, and Zebulum Leavenworth were appointed
                    commissioners to locate, survey, and construct the road from 
                        Leavenworth
                     twenty miles in the direction of 
                        Indianapolis
                    . The pike which was to be any width not exceeding forty feet must
                    be well built and the streams over which the road ran must be well bridged. The
                    course of the road was to be laid off in sections and the construction let out
                    to the lowest bidder, who had to furnish a bond for the faithful performance of
                    his duty. It was required that the road be completed in five years, after which
                    toll gates might be built and fees charged. The fees for riding were: six and
                    one-fourth cents for persons, eighteen and three-fourths cents for carts, twelve
                    and one-half cents for empty carts, fifty cents for loaded wagons, six and
                    one-fourth cents for twenty head of sheep, hogs or cattle.11
                    The money with which to build this road might be raised by selling stock to the
                    citizens of the county. There are many more provisions of this law, but they are
                    not interesting to the reader. The 
                        Leavenworth
                     cousins were trying hard to build up the town of 
                        Leavenworth
                    , but this road was not completed.
            Most of the roads were entitled to use the three per cent. funds in their
                    construction. Julius Woodford was appointed to receive the money derived from
                    this fund and pay out the same at the bidding of the county commissioners. At
                    that time there were $200 of the funds.12
            
            OCCUPATIONS
            
            When the white men first came over the hills into 
                        Crawford county
                     the land was a howling wilderness. Probably not one acre of land
                    was free from trees in the whole county. The first settlers chose the uplands
                    for their homes because the lowlands lacked good drainage and were not
                    healthful.

                            Indiana Laws, 1831-2-3.
               
                     Sometimes the settlers bought the land from
                    the national government before they settled on the land but the great majority
                    settled the land first and later bought it from the government. The price paid
                    the government was $1.25 per acre. The first hard piece of work for the pioneer
                    was to build a cabin. The logs were plentiful out of which almost all were
                    built. The ground was cleared from trees as fast as the pioneer could manage it.
                    A little garden was planted and a field of corn was cultivated. The early
                    pioneer took his grist many miles to mill where the corn was ground into a
                    coarse meal. A few of the squatters pounded up their corn and made meal out of
                    it in that way. The potato patch was the most important after the corn field. As
                    soon as the man was able he set out a small orchard on the farm.
            The early pioneer did not need many things. The woods were full of game and the
                    rivers full of fish. Hence they used wild meat and fish for food. Probably salt
                    was the most difficult of all these foodstuffs to get. There were a few salt
                    springs in the county over in the northwest part, but that region was not
                    settled for a long time. After 1825 the stores at 
                        Fredonia
                     and 
                        Leavenworth
                     furnished the settlers salt. By that time there was a large river
                    trade and much salt was landed at these ports. Before that time the pioneer went
                    to the salt licks a few of which were Royce's and Rock's in 
                        Washington county
                    , French Lick in 
                        Orange county
                     and 
                        Jackson
                    's Lick in 
                        Monroe county
                    . Here he boiled the water down and made him a sack of salt and then
                    rode home on horseback. A few rode to 
                        Jeffersonville
                     to buy a sack of salt and came home the next day. Salt was very
                    high in these days. Seth Leavenworth in 1827 tried to get the tax taken off of
                    salt, but the General Assembly refused to pass the bill.1
            
            The settlers made their own sugar and sirup from the maple trees of which there
                    was a great number in the forests. As late as 1860 the pioneers made large
                    amounts. In 1858, 8,300 pounds were made the value of which was $584. The other
                    farm products of 1850 in 
                        Crawford county
                     were: Wheat, 19,950 bushels; corn, 195,690 bushels; butter, 34,445
                    pounds;

                        pounds.2
            
            The products in 1860 were: Wheat, 76,525 bushels; corn, 192,365 bushels; rye,
                    4,472; oats, 17,462; potatoes, 19,345 bushels; 2,721 barrels of pork, value,
                    $28,483; apples, value, $4,434; hay, 1,500 tons; wool, 10,914 pounds; wine, 707
                    gallons. Just what amount was grown in the early days is impossible to say now
                    on account of the absence of any data on that subject.3

            The potatoes which the people grew were much different from the ones grown
                    nowadays. The leading varieties were pink, peach blow, white peach blow, Prince
                    Albert, early Goodrich, Shaker russet, Mishanoes and the coal boat. In the
                    virgin soil the potatoes grew to be very large. When they were cooked and
                    prepared for eating one could hardly swallow them, they were so strong. They
                    were not comparable with the early 
                        Ohio
                    , rural Newyorker, or the Irish cobbler, which are grown at the
                    present time in the northwest.
            The farmer did his plowing with a jumping shovel, which had one long share.
                    Nothing was more aggravating than such a plow. If the share caught behind a
                    strong root the plow would either jerk a man severely or jump out of the ground
                    and hit him in the ribs with the handles. Neither

                     of these was very pleasant to the man who
                    was plowing. The grain was cut with a sickle or a cradle. Much later in the
                    county a reaper was used.
            By 1850 the settlers had cleared away much of the timber and probably half of the
                    land was under cultivation. The land was very suitable for fruit growing. Many
                    farmers had large orchards in which many varieties of apples grew. The leading
                    ones were summer queen, pearmain, maiden blush, rambo, russet, fall pippin,
                    belle flower, Hall's seedling, horse apple, 
                        Rhode Island
                     greening, jannet, Smith's cider, Carolina red, winesap,
                    limbertwig, and the 
                        New York
                     pippin. Many farmers had a great variety of these apples. The
                    reports of the state fairs held in Indiana showed that men often received prizes
                    for the best exhibit of twenty-five different kinds of apples, and fifteen
                    different kinds of pears.
            Certain years the farmers did not plant much corn. They would climb the beech and
                    the oak trees in the early spring and see if the trees would have a crop of the
                    mast or beechnuts and acorns. At that time of the year there was a little flower
                    on the trees if they were to grow fruit that year. In case of the fruit being
                    grown on the trees then there was no need for much corn. The mast would fatten
                    the hogs well and the meat was thought to be better.
            By 1818 the Indians had gone but the woods were full of wild animals of all
                    kinds, the most dangerous of which were the panther, the bear, the wolf and the
                    wild cat. Of course these animals did not attack man often but they were a great
                    bother in carrying away the young pigs and other stock of the farmer.
            Peter Peckinpaugh who owned a large farm in the southern part of 
                        Ohio
                     township kept several wolf hounds in these early days. One night
                    about 9 o'clock he heard the hogs making a noise down at the pen where
                    he had a few young pigs. He let the dogs out of the kennel and ran down to the
                    pen with a handspike in his hands of which he always kept one near the house.
                    Before he arrived the dogs had caught some animal and were engaged in a terrible
                    fight. It seemed that two of the big dogs had caught the varmit by the neck and
                    the other one had it by the hips in which condition they were just circling
                    around on the ground.  Watching his chance
                    he hit down between them and broke its back. The dogs soon killed the animal
                    then. When day came they found that the animal was a large panther that measured
                    about eight feet in length.
            The county commissioners, in compliance with the state law, offered a bounty of
                    one dollar for each wolf scalp the farmers would bring in. John Stone, James
                    Land, Nathan Ruth, Dan Farley, Enos Campbell, and Edmund Ardach were allowed $1
                    each for wolf scalps in November, 1827.6
            
            Aside from these dangerous animals the woods were full of rabbits, squirrels, and
                    many other smaller animals. Hence the country was a hunter's paradise
                    which enabled him to live on wild meat most all the time.
            
               Big Blue river, Little Blue river, 
                        Turkey
                     Fork, Slick Run and the other streams were full of fish such as the
                    blue cat, the yellow, the pike, sunfish, bass, and various other kinds. Men
                    spent much time in fishing every spring and summer.
            The main wealth of the county was in its timber, of which there was a great
                    amount and for which there was a ready market. Many men were engaged in
                    coopering the rough barrels which were filled with apples and lime while the
                    tight barrels were filled with molasses or apple brandy. The amount of brandy
                    made in the county was very large. Most of it was shipped south to 
                        New Orleans
                     where there was a ready market for that product. The timber was
                    sawn and shipped out in almost all forms. At one time acres of ground at 
                        Leavenworth
                     and 
                        Fredonia
                     were covered with the lumber. When the rise in the river came then
                    the big steamboats would load on the freight and steam away with the lumber. The
                    large boats were the Bostonia, Belle Key, Shotwell, Memphis, and the Eclipse.
                    The Eclipse and the Shotwell were floating palaces and can not be described
                    well. Many large staves (pipe for wine barrels) were made and sold in the south
                    out of which the men made tobacco hogsheads or sugar hogsheads.
            Another great export was lime. Many kilns were made and burned and the product
                    loaded on the boats and shipped south

                     or to 
                        New Albany
                     and 
                        Jeffersonville
                    , where there was a ready market for the product.7
            
            At 
                        Leavenworth
                     and other towns many large barges were built for carrying freight.
                    The barges were loaded with apples, lime, hay, corn, and many other products.
                    The lime was generally put on a flat boat so that the barrels were protected
                    from the rain in foul weather. When the barges were loaded one good boat could
                    tow several barges.
            In 1830 Daniel Lyons began the business of making skiffs for sale. Re made a good
                    grade of skiffs which were sold to men on the Ohio river.
                    Before long these skiffs were known from 
                        Pittsburgh
                     to the Gulf of 
                        Mexico
                    . As far as known no one ever complained about the skiffs. When he
                    died the work of the skiff factory was carried on by his sons, S. P. Lyons and
                    W. A. Lyons. These men used the same good material and judgment in the selection
                    and shaping the boats that their father had used and if any thing the boys put
                    out a better grade of boats than their father had. About 1885 Norton Whitcomb
                    bought out S. P. Lyons' share of the factory and is now one of the
                    managers. At present the old shop has about three men employed in the factory
                    and still turn out the high grade of boats whose reputation has been so high and
                    so well deserved.8
            
            The flat boat trade was very important during the early days of the
                    county's history. The boats were about the size of barges and were
                    covered to protect the crew from the winds and the cargo from the rain and the
                    snow. On the top of the boat and at each end was a steering oar by which the
                    boat was guided. Guiding the boat and rowing it to the shore was very hard work.
                    There were about five men on the boat besides the cook. When the boat was loaded
                    and ready to start the men guided it out into the river and let it drift gently
                    down. Stops were made at most towns and the produce on the boat was sold and
                    other cargoes taken on the boat too. By the time the boat arrived at 
                        New Orleans
                     the cargo was sold and the boat was sold or the owner had some
                    steamboat

                                Leavenworth
                            , one of the owners of the skiff shop.
               
                     to tow it back. Yet he could hire a new one
                    built cheaper than paying for the towing of the old one back, it was generally
                    left.
            Life on the flat boat was very pleasant in beautiful weather, but woe betide the
                    crew of the boat when it was caught out on the swift 
                        Ohio
                     or on the broad 
                        Mississippi
                     when a storm arose. Two men were put at each oar and the boat was
                    rowed ashore by the big steering oars. Then the boat was tied up till fair
                    weather came. The writer has heard old boatmen tell that they were so tired and
                    their arms were so sore that they could not comb their hair after rowing the
                    boat ashore in such a storm. Sometimes it took a day or more to get to shore if
                    the wind set wrong. During the early history of the county the flat boat trade
                    was very large. The boats carried away very much produce and gave an outlet for
                    the products of the county the chief of which were lime, whiskey, corn, smoked
                    meat, and various products from the forests.
            Meat packing was one of the chief industries of the county. The hogs which ran
                    out to the commons generally took care of themselves. Often they would stand on
                    their hind feet and eat the bark off of the slippery elms as high as they could
                    reach. For that reason they were called "elm peelers." When
                    the mast was ripe the hogs grew fat in the fall and were ready for butchering.
                    They were driven to the banks of the Ohio river and there
                    men were hired to help butcher the hogs and smoke the meat. When the meat was
                    ready for shipment it was placed on the flat boat or on the steamboat and
                    shipped south to 
                        New Orleans
                    , where there was a ready market for all the county could ship
                    there.
            The farmer's stock ran out to the commons till about 1887. After that
                    date the stock was kept up in the farmer's own pasture. If the stock
                    was caught out the road supervisor was empowered to empound such stock till the
                    owner paid the fine and the damage if there was any.
            When the stock was running out men had much trouble to keep their stock
                    distinguished from their neighbor's. Many resorted to the ear mark.
                    John Sheckels of 
                        Ohio
                     township claimed that his ear mark for cattle was a slit in the
                    left ear  and an under cut in the right ear.
                    The above statement of Mr. Sheckels was recorded at 
                        Fredonia
                     in October, 1837.9
            
            The still house was another leading industrial establishment. Apples grew in the
                    county by thousands of bushels and were made into apple brandy which was shipped
                    away very easily. Many old traces of the still houses can still be seen in the
                    county.
            One ugly feature of the whole flat boat trade was the danger of robbers. Of a
                    night in many places watches were kept on the boat to keep off the robbers who
                    did not hesitate to kill if it was necessary to get the cargo. The following
                    article was taken from the 
                        New Albany
                    
                    Tribune and may be given here:
            "We are indebted to Captain Vansickle for the account that three men
                    were murdered on the Ohio river near Troy (
                        Perry county
                    ), Indiana, while working on a flat boat. The boat which had been
                    sunk in five feet water had been deserted for many hours. It was a large boat
                    about 95 feet long and loaded with flour, whiskey, and groceries. The boat was
                    named Eliza No. 2. The boat which presented a ghastly sight was marked with
                    blood from one end to the other. The bodies of two of the dead men were found in
                    the boat and the third body was found in the water. The one in the water had
                    weights fastened to it. The men evidently were killed with a hatchett for one
                    was found near which was covered with blood. Their skulls had been crushed in by
                    the severe strokes of the hatchet, and there were various wounds of many kinds
                    found on their bodies. From the appearance many believe that the crew might have
                    mutinied part killing the rest and then robbing the boat of what they could get
                    away with."10
            
            The leading imports were salt, ammunition, and guns. Most of the men made their
                    own clothes and shoes. Coffee and foreign merchandise of various kinds were on
                    hands at the store for sale.
            Corn and wheat were ground into meal and flour by the old time mill. The best
                    known of these mills were Leggett's,

                     near where Alton now stands and
                    Leavenworth's mills at 
                        Leavenworth
                     and at 
                        Milltown
                    , Indiana. Mention is made of these old mills in the county records
                    as early as 1827.
            These mills were run by water power or by horse power. A dam was built across the
                    stream and the water was used to furnish the power. The first mill driven by
                    steam was located at 
                        Leavenworth
                     about 1830. The two 
                        Leavenworth
                     cousins did the managing of the mill there. Much later Carnes, Lake
                    and Benham built mills all of which did excellent work.11
            
            These mills did grinding on certain days of each week. On these days the pioneers
                    came with their grist of corn. The first come was the first served. While the
                    men were waiting for their grist they generally indulged in wrestling or other
                    amusements. When the writer's father was a little boy he went with some
                    men to one of these old mills. The weather was very inclement and the men were
                    in the shelter waiting their turn telling ghost stories. They could not see
                    where the meal was coming out from where they were. Suddenly they heard two
                    hounds which belonged to one of the men barking every now and then. Soon the men
                    went out to see what was the matter and found the two dogs up in the box where
                    the meal came out. They ate the meal about as fast as it came out and then were
                    barking for more. After that one of the men stayed by the meal when the wolf
                    hounds were present with the owners.
            While the men were waiting for their grists they told ghost stories and commented
                    on the wonderful feat of prowess each one had committed once upon a time. The
                    men who did not get their grinding till after dark and had to ride home through
                    the dark while their fancies were active thought that they saw ghosts of all
                    sorts. These old settlers were very superstitious and believed in spirits of all
                    sorts. They saw signs in the heavens and wonders in the earth beneath. They
                    would not begin a job of work on Friday. If they saw the moon through brush that
                    was a bad sign. The potatoes must be planted when the sign was right. Yet in the
                    good old days the men had their joys and were happy, I presume, as they are in
                    our modern times.

            Transportation of Pottawattomies
            THE DEPORTATION OF MENOMINEE AND HIS TRIBE OF THE POTTAWATTOMIE INDIANS
            BENJAMIN F. STUART Burnetts Creek,
                    Ind.
            The deportation of Chief Menominee and his tribe of Pottawattomie Indians from
                    their reservation at Twin Lakes in 
                        Marshall county
                    , in September, 1838, covers one of the darkest pages in the history
                    of our state and has no parallel in the annals of American history. The farther
                    in time. We get away from this event the plainer will this appear and the more
                    interest will be attached to the route which is consecrated by the blood of that
                    helpless people at the hands of a civilized and christian state. Much of this
                    route in this state is a public highway, which I name "The
                    Pottawattomie Trail."
            The Pottawattomie Indians originally occupied the territory north of the
                        Wabash river to 
                        Chicago
                     and 
                        Michigan
                    . Their conversion to the Christian religion through the Catholic
                    faith dated back to 1680. When they did become converted they were nearly as
                    firm and devout as were the primitive Christians. When the priests would leave
                    them, they would teach each other and tried hard to preserve the religious
                    influence they had previously enjoyed. Until Bishop Brute was appointed for 
                        Vincennes
                     in 1834, they were only visited by priests from that place and 
                        Detroit
                    . At this time they numbered four thousand souls.
            One of the first cares of the bishop was to visit this mission which was the only
                    one in northern Indiana, and make provision for their spiritual welfare. He
                    caused to be erected a two-story hewn-log chapel on the north side of the lake.
                    Near this spot stands a monument, erected to their memory through the efforts of
                    Daniel McDonald.
            Rev. M. Desseils of 
                        Michigan
                     was put in charge of this mission and the results were wonderful.
                    The impulse given by the bishop was such that their reverence for the black  gowns which their fathers had transmitted
                    to them, that they vowed if the great spirit would send them another person to
                    minister to their spiritual welfare, they would listen to his instructions and
                    they came by hundreds to demand them and ask for baptism.
            Rev. Desseils baptized a quarter of those who had previously been heathens and
                    soon after that he died. The work to which he had been exposed brought on a
                    spell of sickness that left him almost at the point of death, but feeling that
                    his last moments were fast approaching, he aroused himself and met his faithful
                    children at the altar and while attending them with his dying hands, the last
                    duties enjoined on him by his Master, expired on its very steps. Those who had
                    watched him with much anxiety, and unwilling to believe that their master was
                    dead, and hoping he was only sleeping, remained in prayer by his corpse for four
                    days when another clergyman arrived to perform the funeral rites over his body.
            Rev. Desseils' successor was Benjamin Petit, a young Frenchman, who had
                    left his native land and the profession of law to devote his life as a priest.
                    He did not know their language, but the ardor of his zeal helped him soon to
                    learn it. Wondering at his kindness and pleasant manner, they said he Was not a
                    black gown from a foreign land, but a redskin like themselves.
            Previous to this time, President Jackson, after being importuned to extinguish
                    the title to the lands held by the Indians in northern Indiana, appointed as
                    commissioners, Governor Jonathan Jennings, John W. Davis and Mark Crume. A large
                    number of prominent Indians were present, among them being Wa-She-Anas,
                    Wa-Ban-She, Aub-Bee-Naubee and others, and also Captain Bouri. This conference
                    was held at Chippewa, on the banks of the 
                        Tippecanoe
                    , north of 
                        Rochester
                    , on October twenty-sixth, 1832, the twentieth treaty.
            Governor Jennings, as usual, had imbibed too freely and his conduct so disgusted
                    the Indians that it came near disrupting the whole conference. After a stormy
                    session of several days, the treaty was concluded and by its terms all the land
                    held by them in northern Indiana was ceded to the government, except certain
                    allotments around Twin Lakes and north of them. This treaty included one of
                    their largest  villages and a Catholic
                    mission on the banks of the 
                        Tippecanoe
                    .
            The President did not ratify this treaty until 1836. Meanwhile the trappers,
                    squatters, land sharks and all rushed in, which was in direct violation of the
                    policy of the government, as the President had called the attention of Congress
                    to information in similar cases.
            At this conference the government had forbidden any intoxicating liquor being
                    brought on the grounds. When "Jack Douglas" brought some fine
                    wine and brandies, it, of course, was confiscated and put in the council chamber
                    of one of the commissioners for safe keeping and ready to use as the occasion
                    might require. This proved to be one of the essentials in making this treaty.
                    The terms of this treaty were obtained through persuasion, liquor, bribery,
                    threats and intimidation, and perhaps that is why its ratification was held up
                    for four years. Were a set of men to appeal to our federal court today to
                    confirm their title to a piece of real estate obtained by such methods as did
                    these commissioners employ, the court would dismiss the case, give the
                    appellants a severe reprimand and order their arrest before they got out of the
                    city.
            The terms of this treaty were not what was desired by the land sharks, and their
                    next move was to have Colonel Abel Pepper, the Indian agent, who was stationed
                    at 
                        Logansport
                    , buy these allotments, but after several attempts he failed.
            The next move was to have the state legislature memorialize the federal
                    government to extinguish the title to these lands. Consequently President
                    Jackson appointed John T. Douglas (perhaps the "Jack Douglas"
                    that took part in the conference of 1832), as commissioner, and the Indians were
                    represented by Chee-Chan-Chosee-As-Kum, Wee-Saw-Muk-Koxie, Quin-Quit-To-On.
                    Historians disagree as to the time and place of this treaty. Thomas B. Helms, of 
                        Logansport
                    , a very reliable historian, says it was made in 
                        Washington
                    , D. C, February 11, 1837, and was ratified within one week from its
                    conclusion, all of which appears very plausible and is also confirmed by
                    Menomine in his speech.
            This treaty was a ratification of all former treaties and it was further
                    stipulated that they would move at the end of  two years to lands provided for them by the government, along the
                        Osage river in 
                        Kansas
                    , the expense of the removal and one year's subsistence was
                    to be met by the government. By the terms of the treaty of 1832, Menomine and
                    his tribe, which numbered about 1,500 Indians, were allotted about twenty
                    sections of land around Twin Lakes and extended to within a mile of Plymouth.
                    Their principal village covered nearly two sections north of the lakes and
                    consisted of one hundred wigwams or huts. They raised corn and vegetables as a
                    part means of subsistence. They were peaceable and friendly to the whites who
                    would often attend their church.
            Father Benjamin Petit had charge of the mission, as has been previously stated,
                    and they would come for miles, form large congregations, and were very devout in
                    their mode of worship. Some of them had received an English education and were
                    in a fair way to be assimilated into a loyal citizenship. But this was not to be
                    and as soon as this supposed treaty was made known, they were harassed by land
                    sharks or their agents, squatters and trappers.
            Colonel Abel Pepper was also nagging at them to move, and at a council at Pretty
                    Lake, he threatened to remove them by force. When all had had their say,
                    Menomine arose, his white head towering above all others, with the dignity of
                    Daniel Webster and just as defiant, said in substance: 
                        The President does not know the truth. He, like me, has been deceived. He
                            does not know that your treaty is a lie and that I never have signed it.
                            He does not know that you made my chiefs drunk, got their consent, and
                            pretended to get mine. He does not know that I have refused to sell my
                            lands and still refuse. He would not by force drive me from my home, the
                            graves of my tribe and children, who have gone to the Great Spirit, nor
                            to allow you to tell me that your braves will take me, tied like a dog,
                            if he knew the truth. My brother, the President is just, but he listens
                            to his young chiefs, who have lied. When he knows the truth, he will
                            leave me to my own. I have not sold my lands. I will not sell them; I
                            have not signed any treaty, and I shall not sign any. I am not going to
                            leave my land. I do not want to hear anything more about it.
                    
            
            And amid the applause of his chiefs, he sat down. This speech, delivered in the
                    peculiar style of the Indian orator presented one of those very rare occasions
                    of which  history gives few instances, and
                    would have made a profound impression on any one except those who could see
                    nothing but those broad acres of fine land.
            Andrew Jackson was President when this supposed treaty was made. He stated that
                    it was the policy of the government to deal fairly with the Indians, pay them
                    for their lands, obtain their consent for possession and removal, and whenever
                    possible teach them the arts of civilization, that in time they would assimilate
                    and become loyal citizens. He had previously called on congress for an
                    investigation of cases that had come to his knowledge of where the whites had
                    infringed on the lands of the redmen, and vice versa.
            That it was the duty of the federal government to extinguish the title to lands
                    held by the Indians, and when it did that, the matter rested with the state, and
                    the Indians could leave or stay, but were amenable to the laws of the state; and
                    any further interference on the part of the federal government would be an
                    infringement on the rights of the state and was dangerous.
            Now to charge my country and your country, a Christian nation, with being guilty
                    of making this attack on Christianity and civilization is wrong, not sustained
                    by facts and is an unjust accusation. As to Colonel Abel Pepper, he was a man in
                    form, a fiend, a pliable tool in the hands of Gov. David R. Wallace, father of
                    Gen. Lew Wallace, and those who coveted these lands.
            During the summer of 1838, preparations were made to remove the Indians by force.
                    The Indians were aware of this and had resolved to fight, when, through the
                    counsel of Father Petit, and on his promise to accompany them to their new home,
                    they promised him if the worst did come, they would submit peacefully. This
                    averted a general massacre.
            The Catholic church had labored with these people for over one hundred and fifty
                    years, ofttimes at the cost of the lives of her priests. She had seen her
                    missions swept aside one by one until only this one remained. True to her trust,
                    she stood by these people and used her influence to stay the hand of execution,
                    but all in vain, all the time counseling them to avoid shedding blood.
            
            The work of destruction began in August, 1838, when a body of men entered their
                    village, took possession of their crops, and lands, which was resisted by the
                    Indians driving them out and tearing down their shanties. The crisis came when
                    the cabin of Mr. Waters was torn down by the Indians, and then he and others in
                    return burned some of their huts. A courier was sent to notify their agent,
                    Colonel Pepper, at 
                        Logansport
                    , who was sent on to 
                        Indianapolis
                     to notify the Governor. Gov. Wallace authorized Gen. John Tipton to
                    raise an army and proceed to Twin Lakes and remove them. This removal had been
                    planned to take place later in the fall. This army was made up of troops from
                            
                  Lafayette, Logansport, South
                        Bend
                and Laporte.
            Col. Pepper invited all the tribe to a council to be held at the village on
                    August 29. Not knowing that they were being decoyed, many of them assembled and
                    at the time Mr. Pepper was pretending to hold a council, Gen. Tipton appeared
                    with his army, which were secreted, surrounded the village and made all, between
                    three and four hundred, prisoners. He then proceeded to the church where they
                    were engaged in worship and made his presence known by firing guns and
                    surrounding the church and made all within prisoners. This is the first and only
                    time a religious meeting was broken up and the worshipers made prisoners like a
                    lot of law violators by the order of the governor of our state, whose sworn duty
                    it was to protect them. They pled for mercy and to be let alone, but all to no
                    effect as General Tipton was a military man and knew to obey orders. When
                    evening came and they did not return home others were sent out in search of them
                    and they too were made prisoners. All of these were held under guard while other
                    troops were scouring the reservation for others and destroying their homes. They
                    also rounded up about four hundred ponies that were to be used in their journey.
            Many tragic scenes were enacted in this round-up. Some fought like demons till
                    they were overpowered and roped; some went in hiding, others sought shelter in 
                        Michigan
                    . In one case where they had surrounded the hut and called on the
                    Indian to surrender, he sprang for his tomahawk and rifle and when he saw the
                    cross, which the priest wore,  he threw down
                    his weapons, crossed his arms and held them out to be tied. This work was kept
                    up until they had gathered near fifteen hundred and had placed 859 names on
                    roll. Father Petit was permitted to assemble them for a final service. He says:
                        
                        At the moment of my departure I assembled all my children to speak to
                            them for the last time. I wept and they sobbed aloud. It was a sorrowful
                            sight and over this, our dying mission, we prayed for the success of
                            those missions that they would establish in their new home to which they
                            were being driven.
                    
            
            On the Sunday before their departure, they were visited by many whites who came
                    to bid them farewell. No doubt there were some in that assemblage whose
                    consciences were not at rest. On the last day they were permitted, under guard,
                    to visit the graves of their departed friends, and held an impressive service,
                    heart-rending scenes that were indescribable were witnessed. General Tipton went
                    prepared with sixty wagons and hired teams of horses and oxen. In the meantime
                    these were being loaded with their goods, such as would be needed, the old,
                    sick, of which there were over one hundred, the women and children.
            On September 4, 1838, they were lined up, some afoot, some on ponies, followed by
                    the wagons, and all heavily guarded with a lot of guards at the rear with
                    bayonets, which were often used to keep the weak ones in the procession. Before
                    starting the torch was applied to their village, so that they might see their
                    homes destroyed and they would not want to return. When all was in readiness,
                    this grewsome procession, nearly three miles long, like a funeral procession,
                    which in reality it was, started on its final journey. It was a very sickly
                    season. The sun was hot and the road was dry and dusty. They drove down the 
                        Michigan
                     road to Chippewa, on the 
                        Tippecanoe
                    , where they camped the night of the fourth. Here more was added to
                    their cup of sorrow. They wished to take their dead with them and when this was
                    denied, they had to leave them at the roadside or camping ground, hence every
                    camping ground was a burial ground.
            In making preparations for this expedition it was thought a picnic and many
                    volunteers were turned away, but at the  end
                    of the first day, twenty of the troops, heartsick, stole twenty of the
                    Indians' ponies and deserted the command.
            September 5 they moved down to Mud creek, which is the name applied to the upper
                    course of Big Indian creek, where they camped. There was much suffering for
                    water, as many of the streams were dry, and food, as but little preparation had
                    been made for this. September 6 they reached Logans-port and camped on Honey
                    creek for three days and nights. The physicians of the city came out and
                    rendered what aid they could to the sick. While here two adults and several
                    children died, and were buried just north of the Vandalia railroad. These people
                    were human beings and the love of parent for their offspring was strong. Then
                    think what must have been their grief in taking up their march, and the anxiety
                    of the father at the close of the day to learn of the condition of his family.
            September 10 they started on their march down 
                        Michigan
                     avenue to Eel river, then down the north side
                    of the Wabash river, through Georgetown and forded Crooked
                    creek near the mouth; thence on to the county line, then followed the bank of
                    the river to a creek. On the west side of this creek was old Winamac's
                    village and is about eleven miles below Logans-port. They reached this point at
                    5 p. m., and camped there. I name this Menominee's camping ground on
                    September 10, 1838.
            September 11, at 10:00 a. m., they took up their march. Here the road left the
                    river and followed the foot of the bluff to the Jacob Mullendore farm. From here
                    they followed the top of the bluff to Little Burnett's creek, then at
                    the foot of the bluff through Lockport. On the hillside north of the road is a
                    spring, which was much larger then than it is now. Here some of the Indians were
                    permitted to drink. This spring I name the Pottawattomie spring. From here they
                    followed the foot of the bluff to the line between the Schneip and Kirkpat-rick
                    farms to the river, thence west to Rattle Snake. They forded the creek, ascended
                    the Gilliam hill, where there was a camping ground for
                    tribes that had preceded this one; thence on a line through Conner's
                    reserve to Pleasant Run creek, where they went into camp, after traveling all
                    day in the hot sun, enveloped in a cloud of dust. Cruelty unspeakable! Outrage
                         infinite! For such were the scenes
                    witnessed that night in the grove along the creek whose waters went rippling
                    along to swell the mighty deep. With their condition growing worse every day,
                    one cannot help but wonder if their faith in the God of mercy, whom they had
                    learned to worship, will hold out. May the great Ruler of nations never again
                    permit Indiana to be disgraced by such scenes as were witnessed in 
                        Carroll county
                     those two days and nights while passing through it, should be the
                    prayer of every liberty loving citizen.
            September 12 they took up their line of march by following the road up the hill,
                    crossed the range line to the creek and followed it to Pittsburg. The Delphi Oracle of September 15, 1838, edited by Henry B. Milroy, said:
                        
                        The tribe of Pottawattomie Indians passed down on the west side of the
                                Wabash river a few days ago on their way to
                            their new home along the Osage river in 
                                Kansas
                            . The procession is very imposing, covering a distance of
                            nearly three miles, all in charge of Gen. John Tipton. who will place
                            them in charge of Judge Polk at the state line.
                    
            
            From here they followed the Delphi and Battleground road along the bank of the
                    Wabash to the Case farm, fording the Tippecanoe river at
                    11:00 a. m., at Hog's point and reached Battleground at noon. They
                    camped near here the night of the twelfth. It was here that General Tipton
                    distributed $5,000 worth of goods to allay the discontent and revive their
                    spirits. This only proved temporary.
            September 13 they traveled seventeen miles and reached 
                        Lagrange
                     where they camped. Heat and dust getting worse, teams worn out,
                    many of the troops sick and unable to proceed, Dr. Richie and son, attending
                    physicians, nearly out of medicine, one hundred and sixty sick Indians, large
                    numbers had to be left to their fate along the road and the children dying at
                    the rate of three to five per day, the faith that had carried them thus far was
                    being shaken and the Indian spirit of freedom or death was showing itself. It
                    was at this time Colonel Pepper and General Tipton began to come to their
                    senses. General Tipton sent an urgent message back to Father Petit to hasten to
                    his aid, and by permission of Bishop Brute, he started.
            
            September 14 they reached Williamsport where they camped and on Sunday, September
                    16, near Perrysville, Father Petit came up to them. He says: 
                        I came in sight of my poor christian children marching in a line, guarded
                            by soldiers, who hastened their steps, a burning hot sun cast its rays
                            down upon them. After them came the wagons, into which were crowded the
                            women, children, the sick and dying. Almost all the babies were dead or
                            dying. I baptized several newly born babes, whose first step was from
                            exile to heaven.
                    
            
            At Danville on September 18, the command was handed over to Judge William Polk,
                    who was appointed by the government to receive them. After resting two days they
                    took up their line of march, leaving six graves under the shadow of the cross.
            Their hardships only increased as they moved along over the parched prairie, no
                    water and the nights growing cooler. After near two months' journey,
                    the remnant of the tribe reached the Osage river with a
                    loss of one-fifth of its original number, besides the great number of children.
                    Father Petit was so worn out, that he could not return at once as directed by
                    the Bishop, but as soon as he was able he started on his return and reached 
                        St. Louis
                    , where he died. His remains now lie at Notre Dame beside those of
                    Father Des-seils. Of all the names connected with this crime, there is one,
                    Father Benjamin Petit, the Christian martyr, which' stands like a star
                    in the firmament, growing brighter and will shine on through ages to come.
            In conclusion, if the reader, in his imagination, will go with me where the trail
                    crosses the highway near the Rattlesnake bridge, not far from the banks of the 
                        Wabash
                    , I will show him a pen picture, part of which was drawn by an
                    eyewitness. He said: 
                        It was a sad and mournful spectacle to see those children of the forest
                            as they slowly retired from the homes of their childhood; as they cast
                            mournful glances backward to the loved scenes that were fading in the
                            distance, tears fell from the eyes of the warriors, old men trembled,
                            matrons wept, and the swarthy cheek of the maiden turned pale. Sighs and
                            half suppressed sobs escaped from the motley group as they passed along,
                            some on foot, some on ponies and others in wagons, all driven, like  cattle to the shambles, to a
                            strange country they knew not where. I saw several of the warriors
                            casting glances toward the sky as if they were imploring aid from the
                            spirits of their departed heroes, who were looking down from the clouds,
                            or from the Great Spirit who would ultimately redress the wrongs of the
                            red man, whose broken bow had fallen from his hands and whose sad heart
                            was bleeding within him.
                    
            
            Oh Civilization! what crimes are committed in thy name!
            Dear reader, in fancy, I stood there at midnight, the moon shone in all its
                    splendor with nothing to break the stillness of the night save the occasional
                    hooting of an owl, when I heard the hoofs of a horse as he came galloping down
                    the Gilliam hill. I heard him as he splashed through the
                    creek, and as he passed by, I saw he carried a messenger, but it was not Paul
                    Revere. The next day at 10:00 a. m., looking to the east I saw a cloud of dust,
                    then came galloping down the road a horse and rider, and as he drew near, I saw
                    that it was not Phil Sheridan, but Father Petit, hastening on to comfort his
                    people and to counsel them to humbly submit to the will of David Wallace, the
                    governor of the Christian state of Indiana.
            You need not go to Concord, nor Winchester, nor any battle field to learn of
                    deeds of heroism, nor to far off Acadia and behold the burning of Grand Pre to
                    learn of the injustice meted out to the weak by the strong and greedy, if you
                    study the history of your state, Indiana, our own Indiana.
         
         
         
            The Knownothing Party In Indiana
            (Continued)
            Carl Brand
            
            The Campaign of 1856 In
                        Indiana
            
            The year 1856 marked the advent of the Know Nothings into national politics, for
                    their first and only presidential campaign. Circumstances seemed favorable for
                    the success of a new party. The Democratic administration had given universal
                    dissatisfaction to the north. A revival of the Whig party was conceded to be
                    hopeless. The Republican party was not yet organized on a national basis, but it
                    was already beginning to overshadow the American movement in the north. Which
                    one of the two would survive to contest future elections with the Democracy
                    depended largely on the issue of the campaign of 1856.
            The Grand Council was to meet at 
                        Philadelphia
                     February 18, 1856. As this body did not have the power to nominate
                    candidates, President Bartlett of the Grand Council issued a call for a national
                    convention to be held at the same place four days later. Each state delegation
                    was to consist of one delegate from each congressional district and two from the
                    state at large.1 As a matter of fact the same
                    representatives were to compose both council and convention.
            Since the Indiana delegation at 
                        Cincinnati
                     had acquiesced in the move for a reunion with the Grand Council,
                    preparations were made to send representatives to the 
                        Philadelphia
                     session. The "twelfth section" issue however was
                    not allowed to go unnoticed. If not expunged it would prevent a union of the
                    anti-slavery forces and make certain the election of a Democrat. Another view
                    was that it introduced the question of slavery where nothing should have been
                    said on the subject.2 For either the former or the latter
                    reason most of

                     the Indiana Americans favored the excision
                    of the twelfth section.
            The First district convention met at 
                        Princeton
                    , January 22, 1856.3 As the Know Nothings of the
                    First district were the strongest "South" Americans in
                    Indiana, the delegates were mostly "twelfth section" men, in
                    favor of non-interference on slavery. Delegates were in attendance from
                    Vander-burg, 
                  Warrick, Posey, Knox
               , and 
                        Gibson
                     counties. Judge Samuel Hall of 
                        Princeton
                     was chairman; James A. Mason of the 
                        Vincennes
                    
                    Gazette and Addison H. Sanders of the 
                        Evansville
                    
                    Journal, secretaries. A. M. Phelps of 
                        Warrick county
                     was appointed a delegate to the national convention with James A.
                    Mason as alternate, and was instructed to vote for Millard Fillmore. A series of
                    resolutions was adopted which would satisfy the straightest Americans. It called
                    for a revision of the laws on suffrage; none but Americans in spirit and in
                    thought should rule America; the Bible should be kept in the schools; and the
                    union must be preserved. Any mention of the slavery issue or the 
                        Kansas
                    -
                        Nebraska
                     question was carefully avoided. These resolutions are noteworthy as
                    the only case in which an important body in Indiana put forth a platform that
                    was strictly American, and not tainted with "abolitionism."
            On February 8, the Americans of the Seventh district held their convention at 
                        Greencastle
                    . General G. K. Steele of 
                        Rockville
                     was appointed as delegate with instructions to vote for
                        Fillmore.4
            
            There is no record of any other district convention. William Sheets, president of
                    the order, and Solomon Meredith were delegates, but whether elected by district
                    convention or appointed by the state council for the state at large is
                    uncertain.
            The Grand Council met at 
                        Philadelphia
                     February 18, 1856. Sheets, Phelps, and Meredith constituted the
                    Indiana delegation. In the absence of President Bartlett, Sheets was called

                    in which he expressed the hope that sectional issues would be laid aside and
                    that the true spirit of American principles might reign supreme in the
                        convention.5 But the slavery question would not down.
                    Sheets made a speech in which he assured the southern members that the
                    "twelfth section" must be expunged if the party wished to
                    carry the north.6 In spite of his efforts to propitiate the
                    pro-slavery members, he gained the name of "rank abolitionist"
                    for himself. After two days of exciting debate the "twelfth
                    section" was abolished and a new plank inserted which declared merely
                    for the enforcement of all laws constitutionally enacted until their repeal.7 The eighth section was altered in such manner as to please
                    the 
                        Louisiana
                     Catholicss The new platform was adopted by a
                    vote of 108 to 77; Sheets and Phelps voting with the majority and Meredith with
                    the minority.9 While the north had gained the repeal of the
                    "twelfth section," the conservatives were successful in
                    resisting all attempts to commit the order to any principle of emancipation. The
                    Grand Council finished its work on February 21, having returned to the policy of
                    neutrality and non-interference.
            On February 22 the national council reorganized as a nominating convention. A
                    resolution was introduced that the national council had no authority to
                    prescribe a platform of principles for the nominating convention and that no
                    candidates for president and vice-president who were not in favor of
                    interdicting slavery north of 36° 30' should be nominated by
                    the convention. It was tabled by a vote of 141 to 59.10 A
                    motion to proceed to the nominations was carried, whereupon most of the
                    anti-slavery delegates, including all from

                        Pennsylvania
                    , withdrew from the convention.11 The Indiana
                    delegates retained their seats and did not join the bolters.12 The convention then proceeded with the nominations. Sheets wished a
                    nomination postponed, but was overruled.13 Millard Fillmore,
                    of 
                        New York
                    , and Andrew J. Donelson, of Tennesee, were made the candidates for
                    president ond vice-president, respectively. The vote of the Indiana delegation
                    stood, two for McLean and one for Fillmore, the latter vote being cast by
                        Phelps.14 Because of their failure to withdraw the
                    Indiana delegates were regarded as being favorably disposed toward the South
                    American faction.15
            
            The seceders met at Merchants' hall with Lieutenant Governor Ford, of 
                        Ohio
                    , presiding. Indiana was not represented among the sixty-seven
                    delegates. They issued an address protesting against the nomination of Fillmore
                    and the admission of the Catholic Louisiana delegates, and demanding the
                    restoration of the 
                        Missouri
                     Compromise line. Solomon Meredith was put on the executive
                    committee for Indiana. He was not in the seceders' convention but had
                    voted against the nomination of Fillmore.16 The seceders,
                    who were known as North Americans, issued a call for a convention to be held at 
                        New York
                    , June 12, 1856.
            Neither the platform nor the candidate of the convention aroused much enthusiasm
                    in Indiana. The

                     which was rapidly becoming identified with
                    the Republican movement: 
                        We find more to disapprove in what the platform leaves unsaid, than in
                            what it says. The whole slavery question, its extension,
                            nationalization, the fraud by which it gained entrance into and the
                            violence by which it strives to keep its hold of, the new territories,
                            are utterly ignored, is
                    
            
            Nativism was made the issue; there was a complete abandonment of all the
                    Republicans were working for.19
            
            The nomination of Fillmore upon such a platform was thought to be dictated by
                    southern influence: 
                        It is the work of Southern States and twelfth section delegates
                            generally. It is a nomination by those favorable to the repeal of the 
                                Missouri
                             Compromise and opposed to its restoration. It is a
                            nomination of those advocating the Southern doctrine of the extension of
                            slavery. We look upon the whole affair as most disastrous to the fair
                            character and claims of Millard Fillmore. … No one can
                            suppose that a nomination from such a source can be anything other than
                                sectional.20
                  
                    
            
            Such was the opinion of a paper favorable to Fillmore personally. Another
                    American paper, the 
                        Aurora
                    
                    Standard, took somewhat the same stand: 
                        At almost any other time we should have hailed the nomination of Millard
                            Fillmore with delight. … But as he has been nominated upon a
                            slavery extension platform we must wait until we hear from him before we
                            promise him our unqualified support. If … he will come out
                            firmly in opposition to slavery extension, we shall give him our hearty
                            support, but if he does not, we shall have to look for some other
                            candidate. The time has come when this issue must be met, and if
                            possible, set at rest forever. It cannot be ignored and we will support
                            no man who is disposed to ignore it.21

                    Know Nothingism had cooled since 1854, held that by the nomination the party was
                    harnessed to a faction and committed to the propagandism of slavery, making

                     Compromise.22
            
            The platform and nominee did please one political faction. A remnant of the old
                    Whigs still existed, faithful to Whiggery and unidentified with the other
                    movements of the time although they had long ceased to maintain an organization
                    in Indiana. A portion of these now stood for the same principles as the
                    Americans. They regarded the 
                        Philadelphia
                     platform very favorably because it ignored the 
                        Kansas

                        Nebraska
                     question.23
            
            The main question before the Americans in the early part of 1856 was whether or
                    not they would co-operate with the Republicans in the state campaign. Because of
                    their own weakness and the increased strength of the latter, it was practically
                    certain that they could not direct a fusion movement to their own ends as in
                    1854. The efficiency of the Know Nothing secret machinery was gone. Many of the
                    lodges had disbanded and many of those who supported Fillmore were not willing
                    to sacrifice their anti-slavery opinions to their Americanism. Yet they claimed
                    to muster fifty thousand votes in the state, a number with which they could do
                    nothing themselves, but without which the Republicans could not hope for
                        victory.24 It was plainly seen that united there was a
                    chance to carry the state; if the Americans put their own ticket in the field,
                    defeat was certain. On the other hand the party might lose its identiy by fusing
                    with a stronger movement. Also any union with the Republicans would be certain
                    to incur the displeasure of the southern wing of the party.
            The first step toward a fusion was taken by a convention of editors of the
                    People's party at 
                        Indianapolis
                    , December 18, 1855. Milton Gregg, of the 
                        New Albany
                    
                    Tribune, presided and many other American editors were
                    present. The convention endorsed the People's platforms of 1854 and
                    1855 and recommended the calling of a nominating convention the following
                        May.25 The American papers took up the call and

            The executive committee of the American state council held a meeting at 
                        Indianapolis
                    , April 2, 1856, at which the question of co-operation with the
                    Republicans was debated. The majority favored fusion, so the following circular
                    was issued: 
                        
                     
                                Indianapolis
                            , April 2, 1856.
                        To the Members of the American Party of Indiana:
                        At a meeting of the executive committee of the State Council, held at 
                                Indianapolis
                            , on the 2nd day of April, 1856, after a full expression of
                            the members upon those questions that have divided and distracted the
                            American party in other States, the committee unanimously adopted the
                            following suggestions and earnestly request the true friends of
                            Americanism to cooperate with them in carrying out the views of the
                            committee: That as in 1854 we stand uncompromisingly opposed to the
                            present corrupt national administration, and as a party we stand ready
                            to cooperate with any party which aims to put an end to its misrule. And
                            further: we regard the repeal of the 
                                Missouri
                             Compromise as an infraction of the plighted faith of the
                            nation. The same should be restored, and if efforts to that end fail,
                            Congress should refuse, under all circumstances, to admit any State into
                            the Union tolerating slavery, made free by that compromise. Therefore we
                            approve of the call for a People's convention to be held on the
                            first day of May next, and earnestly call, upon the American party
                            throughout the State to send a full delegation to that convention.

            The order of President Sheets was regarded in some quarters as an attempt to sell
                    out the Americans to the "abolitionist" Republican party, but
                    the general temper of the former was favorable to a fusion and full delegations
                    were appointed by the county councils.28
            
            The platforms of former fusion conventions had invariably contained a temperance
                    plank. This time the Harrison. County council, desiring to avoid the temperance
                    issue, instructed its delegates, not to commit the American party to any state
                    issue on temperance but to leave it in such a position that the counties may
                    form their ticket to suit their particular localities.29

            A preliminary meeting of the delegates was held April 30. William Sheets
                    explained the American position: that he and those who had voted with him to
                    repeal the "twelfth section," would do all they could to unite
                    the Americans in the great People's movement of the north.30
            
            The convention met, May 1, 1856. Solomon Meredith, of 
                        Richmond
                    , and General G. K. Steele, of 
                        Rockville
                    , were the Americans on the nominating committee. They reported a
                    list of officers, naming Henry S. Lane for president. Milton Gregg of 
                        New Albany
                     and James N. Ritchey of 
                  
                            Franklin
                         were among the vice-presidents.31
            
            The harmony that nominally existed between the Republicans and the Americans was
                    broken when David Kilgore, a former Know Nothing, introduced a resolution that
                    the convention should nominate delegates to attend the Republican national
                    convention, the following June. On behalf of the Americans, R. N. Hudson, of the 
                        Terre Haute
                    
                    Express, protested, saying that as the convention was not
                    exclusively Republican, it could not nominate delegates. But loud cries of
                    "Yes, it is," drowned out his voice and he sat down. Kilgore
                    replied that he was an older and a better American than Hudson, but that
                    Americanism could be postponed while the 
                        Kansas
                     question could not, and he hoped that all would unite in securing a
                    representation in the 
                        Philadelphia
                     convention. He declared however that no nomination would be made
                    which would "tread upon the toes of the Know Nothings." A 
                        Knox county
                     Know Nothing spoke against Kilgore's resolution, but it
                    was of no avail.32 The incident showed the relative weakness
                    of the Americans. The conditions of 1854 were reversed –the Americans
                    were the tools of Republicans instead of vice versa. It showed that the Union
                    between the two rested on a very slight foundation.
            There is evidence that an agreement had been reached by the Republican and
                    American leaders as to the state ticket, but in the convention the straight
                    Republicans were in the ascendent and but one friend of Fillmore was given a
                    place,

                    been vice-president of the Know Nothing order in the state in 1854-55, but was
                    now fully identified with the Republican party. The Americans were thus frozen
                    out. The party, which claimed to include from one-third to one-half of the
                    Fusion strength in the entire state and nine-tenths of it in the southern part,
                    was represented by one candidate among nine. The Americans had come to the
                    convention to fuse, but the Republicans now took the stand that their own
                    principles must be kept supreme.
            A plank was inserted in the platform to placate the Americans. It read as
                    follows: 
                        
                     Resolved, That we are in favor of the Naturalization
                            Laws of Congress with the five years probation, and that the right of
                            suffrage should accompany and not precede naturalization's
                    
            
            A set of district electors was appointed, among whom were James C. Veatch and
                    David Kilgore, of American sympathies. Among the delegates appointed to attend
                    the Republican national convention were Jonathan S. Harvey, of 
                        Marion
                    ; James N. Ritchey, of 
                        Johnson
                    ; W. J. Peaslee, of 
                        Shelby
                    ; George K. Steele, of 
                        Parke
                    ; Godlove S. Orth, of 
                        Tippecanoe
                    ; and Charles H. Test, of 
                        Wayne
                    ; all former members of Know Nothing councils. On the state central
                    committee were placed J. S. Harvey, James Ritchey and George K. Steele.38
            
            The Fusion editors of the state took advantage of the nominating convention to
                    hold another meeting. The proceedings were kept secret, but among the American

            Although they had been rather coldly treated in the convention, the Americans as
                    a whole were determined to support the ticket nominated there.3S With but three or four exceptions the American press fell into line and
                    placed the Fusion ticket in their columns below the names of Fillmore and
                    Donelson. But the twelfth section "South" Americans could not
                    stand by a ticket and platform that was so strongly Republican in color.39 The 
                        Vevay
                    
                    Reveille, an ultra American paper, repudiated the convention
                    and its platform in toto.40 It could not
                    support "Black Republican Abolitionism." Sheets was blamed for
                    the failure of the Americans. 
                        The officiating head of the American party in Indiana is rotten to the
                            core! He has sold us to our enemies. there is not a single American
                            editor at 
                                Indianapolis
                            . who was not disgusted at the course pursued at that
                            convention,
                     wrote the editor, F. J. Waldo.41 Only on condition
                    that the ticket be divided more equally between the Republicans and Americans
                    would he support a Fusion ticket. Let Judge Jeremiah Sullivan, of 
                        Madison
                    , be put in Morton's place, and give the latter the
                    candidacy for attorney-general; give R. N. Hudson, of 
                        Terre Haute
                    ; T. A. Goodwin, of 
                        Brookville
                    , and David Laird, of 
                        Perry county
                    , places on the ticket, and then pure Americans could support it.42 The Rising Sun Visitor said the Fusion
                    ticket could not hope to receive the support of the American party. It favored a
                    separate and independent organization of the American party on its own
                        merits.43 Likewise the Rockford Herald
                    hoped that the American party would "cut loose from abolitionism and
                    set up for itself," for Americanism had been entirely repudiated by the
                        convention.44

                     Also the Corydon Argus
                    and the Paoli Constitutional-ist refused to endorse the
                    convention or put the nominees at the head of their columns because they would
                    not support an "abolition" ticket.45 But
                    these were the exceptional instances.
            The Americans and Republicans combined their forces for the city elections of
                    April and May, 1856, but met with scant success. The fusion was successful in 
                        Crawfordsville
                     and the Know Nothing strongholds, 
                        New Albany
                     and 
                        Jeffersonville
                    , but in the other cities the Old Line Democracy was uniformly
                        victorious.46
            
            The American state convention was called for July 16, 1856. Several of the pure
                    American papers, such as the 
                        Vevay
                    
                    Reveille and the Rising Sun Visitor,
                    agitated for a convention at 
                        New Albany
                     on July 4 to nominate a separate state ticket and reorganize the
                    American party.47 Their object was to remove the convention
                    from the influence of a People's convention which was to be held at 
                        Indianapolis
                    , July 15, to ratify the nomination of Fremont and 
                        Dayton
                    . They feared that the radical anti-slavery Fusionists would
                    dominate the American convention to the exclusion of American principles. The 
                        New Albany
                    
                    Tribune and others who looked more favorably on the Fusionists
                    opposed the idea of a pure American convention and proposed one at 
                        Indianapolis
                     the same day that the People's convention met. This
                    faction looked forward not only to the endorsement of the nominees of the
                    convention of May 1, but also to a union electoral ticket. In the end the
                    convention was called to meet at 
                        Indianapolis
                    , July 16, the day after the Fusion convention.48 It is noteworthy that the American convention now followed the
                    People's instead of preceding it. The Know Nothings of 1854 and 1855
                    pursued a policy calculated to manipulate the People's movement to
                    their own ends. The Americans of 1856 waited to see what the Fusionists did
                    before they themselves acted. The call was issued by a committee of Americans,
                    mostly from southeastern Indiana, appointed for that purpose, and was signed

                     by several hundred voters. It was addressed
                    to Fillmore men and to national Whigs, who were invited to co-operate in the
                    formation of a Fillmore electoral ticket and transact other business.49 The Americans over the state proceeded to the nomination
                    of delegates. In some cases, as in 
                        Harrison county
                    , delegates were regularly nominated by American mass meetings;50 in others, as at 
                        Terre Haute
                    , "all who were friends of Fillmore and Donelson"
                    were constituted delegates to the convention.51
            
            The People's convention, or Republican, as it was frequently styled, met
                    July 15, 1856. Among the delegates were Godlove S. Orth, Judge W. J. Peaslee,
                    George K. Steele, J. C. Moody, and Berry Sulgrove, all formerly active Know
                    Nothings. The convention did little more than make a great demonstration and
                    ratify the nomination of Fremont and 
                        Dayton
                     and the state ticket.52
            
            The American convention met at 
                        Indianapolis
                     the next day, July 16. The three or four hundred delegates that
                    were present made but a feeble showing in contrast with the thousands that had
                    attended the convention of the previous day.53 The
                    delegations, with the exception of those from 
                  New Albany, Jeffersonville, Terre

                    and a few other old Know Nothing strongholds, were not large.54 Not more than ten counties from the entire state were represented by
                    delegates properly appointed.55 Only about one-fourth of the
                    counties were represented at all. The entire Fifth district was unrepresented,
                    and but one man was present from the Tenth. The delegates formed a procession
                    and marched to the state house, where, in the hall of the house of
                    representatives, the convention organized by calling General W. E. R. Armstrong,
                    of Clark, to the chair, and appointing Squire Robinson, of

            After the organiation a committee, consisting of one member from each
                    congressional district which was represented, was appointed to report on a
                    permanent organization. This committee consisted of John S. Hopkins, Jonathan
                    Paine, R. N. Lamb, Thomas Poe, Henry Bradley, C. H. Bailey, A. W. Peyton, G. W.
                    Blakemore, John H. Young, and Alfred Lyons. To this committee was also referred
                    a resolution instructing them to report a state electoral ticket for Fillmore
                    and Donelson.
            A committee on resolutions was appointed, likewise of one member from each
                    congressional district. The members were: James Harlan, George P. R. Wilson, F.
                    J. Waldo, William H. Gregory, C. C. Butler, Richard W. Thompson, M. Bemis, A. L.

            An attempt to prevent the nomination of a separate electoral ticket caused great
                    confusion. John W. Ray, of 
                        Jeffersonville
                    , proposed an endorsement of Fremont on grounds of expediency, but
                    such a proposal received little encouragement.
            Richard W. Thompson, of 
                        Vigo
                    , was elected permanent chairman. A platform was reported, and
                    adopted, which endorsed the nomination of Fillmore; opposed a sectional struggle
                    for the presidency; and condemned the administration for countenancing the
                    repeal of the 
                        Missouri
                     Compromise and the agitation of the slavery question.58
            
            A resolution was offered which endorsed the People's state ticket, but
                    it was promptly and enthusiastically voted down. This brought a response from R.
                    N. Hudson, of the 
                        Terre Haute
                    
                    Express, and Mr. French, of the

                    Republican, who declared that if the convention did not stand
                    by the pledge the Americans, in common with the Republicans, had made to support
                    the People's ticket, they would desert Fillmore and go for Fremont. Their efforts were not successful.
                    Instead of endorsing the People's ticket, the following resolution was
                    passed which did not even recommend that the Americans support the ticket:

            The nomination of a separate electoral ticket, and the failure to endorse the
                    People's candidates resulted in another secession from the American
                    ranks. R. N. Hudson, of the

                    Express, carried out the threat made on the floor of the
                    convention by hauling down the Fillmore flag and hoisting that of Fremont and 
                        Dayton
                    .62 He was followed by Mason, of the

                    thus added to the ever increasing list of Republican papers.
            The nomination of a separate electoral ticket met with the approval of the pure
                    Americans, but was opposed by a strong

                    alone the Americans could not hope to carry the state, but combined with the
                    Republicans there was a strong probability of success. This faction did not
                    cease to agitate the withdrawal of the separate ticket and the formation of a
                    joint ticket of some sort.64
            
            The Americans prepared for the campaign by a systematic reorganization of their
                    councils throughout the state.65 Fillmore clubs were formed
                    in

                    centers of American sentiment.67 It is noteworthy that there
                    is mention of but one such organization north of the National road. Colonel R.

                    third party.68
            
            The strength of the American party was uncertain, but it was admitted to be much
                    less than it had been in the winter of 1854-55, when a million and a half of
                    voters were enrolled in the Know Nothing councils. It was then freely predicted
                    and often conceded that they held the next presidential election in their
                        hands.69 The thirteen electoral votes of Indiana were
                    regarded as certain to be cast for the American candidate.70
                    The series of secessions had weakened them, but still they claimed to number
                    between forty and sixty thousand in the state.71 This
                    strength was entirely in the southern and western portion of the state. Fremont
                    was absolutely unknown in the "Pocket." The opposition in
                    southern Indiana was practically all American. But even the stanchest Americans

                    nothing left to induce them to support it except a desire to defeat the party in
                    power. About the same time Godlove S. Orth and William Sheets, the two
                    ex-presidents of the order in Indiana, and J. C. Moody, of 
                        Floyd
                    , one of its active organizers, became fully identified with the
                    Republican party.76 The Fremont campaign continued to win
                    away hundreds of Americans.77
            
            There were signs of a rapprochement between the Democratic party and the
                    Americans. The state platform of the former contained a condemnation of all
                    secret political organizations,78 which was aimed at the
                    Americans, although that description no longer fitted their organization. But as
                    the campaign progressed the Americans were encouraged in order to draw off
                    support from the Republicans. The Democratic papers now kindly opened their
                    columns for American notices and items. The conservative Americans were
                    cordially invited to join the Democratic ranks where a few months before only
                    the bitterest invective had been employed against them.79

                     financial aid.80 The
                    speeches of Richard W. Thompson, who stumped the state for Fillmore, denouncing
                    the Republicans as "Abolitionists, disunionists and
                    incendiaries," were so Old Line in character that they gave rise to the
                    belief that he was a stipendiary of the Democrats.81
            
            The advances of the Democracy did not shake the determination of the
                    "North" Americans to support the People's state
                    ticket. The fact that Willard, the Democratic candidate for governor, had
                    denounced the Know Nothings as illiberal and proscriptive, was not forgotten by
                    the 
                        New Albany
                    
                    Tribune, which called upon the Fillmore men to vote for
                        Morton.82 The Fillmore club of the same city passed
                    resolutions to support the state, congressional and county candidates of the
                    People's party at the October election.83 The
                    Fusion managers were somewhat careful in their efforts to keep them loyal.
                    Anti-slavery speakers were kept out of the districts that were strongly
                    "South" American.84
            
            The few Old Line Whigs who still remained, unattached to any other party,
                    occupied a political position almost identical with that of the American party
                    on the slavery question. It was not surprising then, that in their national
                    convention at 
                        Baltimore
                    , September 18, 1856, the nominations of Fillmore and Donelson were
                    endorsed. W. K. Edwards, of 
                        Terre Haute
                    , an elector on the American ticket, was one of the Indiana
                    delegates to the convention and there voted for Fillmore.85
                    Although on the Fillmore electoral ticket he was there as an old Whig and
                    nothing else, as he never had been a Know Nothing.

                        old Republicans that "Dick" Thompson was paid by the
                        Democrats to keep the American ticket in the field, and to him was due the defeat of the Republicans in Indiana in 1856. No proof
                        was ever advanced. Soon after the election he received the sum of $40,000
                        from the government for legal services rendered to the Indians. This
                        probably causd the story to be so widely believed. See also the

            While the Democrats were well pleased at the prospect of a divided opposition,
                    the Republicans were making every effort to discourage the support of a third
                    ticket. With such Americans as Milton Gregg, of the 
                        New Albany
                    
                    Tribune, they might meet with some success, but most of the
                    Americans were determined to support Fillmore. The Fillmore club at 
                        Indianapolis
                     passed resolutions not to coalesce with either of the old
                        parties.86 Likewise the club at 
                        Terre Haute
                     resolved that they would "neither desire, seek, claim or
                    court any alliance with the Democrat or Republican parties. that we are for
                    Millard Fillmore unto the end."87 Veatch, the
                    Fusion nominee for congress in the First district, was not acceptable to all the
                    Fillmore men because of his support of Fremont. A Fillmore mass meeting at
                            
                  West Franklin, Posey county
               , resolved not to support
                    any candidate (i. e., Veatch) who did not adhere to Fillmore and Donelson.88 There would be no supporters of Fremont or a fusion
                    electoral ticket among these Americans. The matter was finally set at rest by
                    the American state central committee, which met at 
                        Indianapolis
                    , September 24, and issued the following statement: 
                        That the statement made by some papers that the Americans will support
                            the Republican electoral ticket is untrue; on the contrary they have
                            their own ticket composed of Fillmore men and intend to support it,
                            without union or fusion with any other party.

            The Americans conducted.a vigorous campaign in southern Indiana, but abandoned
                    the northern portion to the Democrats and Republicans. Fillmore rallies,
                    barbecues, and mass meetings were numerous and well attended in the counties
                    along the 
                        Ohio
                     and the 
                        Wabash
                    .90 R. W. Thompson bore the burden of the
                    speaking campaign, and American orators from 
                        Kentucky
                     assisted. One of the latter, Judge Yeaman, of Owens-borough, at a
                    barbecue at Enterprise, 
                        Spencer county

                     a period of probation of forty-two years
                    for foreigners in the 
                        United States
                    .91 The Americans of 
                        Indianapolis
                     sent a delegation to attend a great mass meeting at 
                        Cincinnati
                    , but its small size aroused only the derision of the other
                        parties.92 There was one riot between Democrats and
                    Americans, at 
                  Henryville,
                            Clark county
               , and two of the
                    latter were killed.93 Other disorders occurred in 
                        New Albany
                    , where the Republicans charged the Americans of using violence to
                    break up Fremont meetings.94
            
            The state election was held October 14, 1856. The contest was very close and not
                    until the last returns were in was it known who was elected, but Willard
                    received a plurality of 5,842 votes over Morton and carried the entire ticket
                    with him.65. John M. Dawson, the People's candidate
                    for secretary of state, ran somewhat behind the rest of his ticket, which was
                    taken to indicate that the Americans had scratched him in return for his
                    desertion of their cause.88 The Americans would be
                    represented in the next state legislature by two representatives, John W. Wright
                    and John J. Hay den, elected from 
                        Ohio
                     and 
                        Switzerland
                     counties, and by two hold-over senators, P. S. Sage, from the same
                    counties, and David Crane, of 
                        Floyd
                    .97
            
            The Fusionists secured control of the house, but the senate was Democratic. In 
                        Vigo county
                     each party had brought out a candidate for representative and the
                    result displayed the weakness of the Americans in that county, which was
                    supposed to be a hot-bed of Americanism. The vote stood: Democrat, 1,796;
                    Republican, 1,435; American, 547.98 The
                    "South" Americans of 
                        Vigo
                     would not fuse on their candidate, as had been done in most of the
                    other counties.
            The Republicans were bitterly disappointed at the result and sought to lay the
                    responsibility for the defeat upon the Americans, whom they accused of
                    double-crossing. Governor-elect

                     Willard, in a speech soon after his
                    victory, remarked that the Know Nothings had voted for him because they did not
                    wish to add abolitionism to Know Nothingism." This gave color to the
                    charge that nine out of ten Fillmore men had deserted Morton.100 Every county in the state in which there was a large American element
                    had gone heavily against Morton. The counties along the 
                        Ohio
                    , in the "pocket" and on the 
                        Wabash
                     had given Willard majorities.101 It was
                    reported that Fillmore men had everywhere voted openly for Willard; that the
                    Americans of 
                        Knox
                     and 
                        Vigo
                     counties had gone in a body into the Democratic ranks. In 
                        Decatur county
                     a council of the entire party was said to have been called upon the
                    eve of the election and there it was decided to cast their vote solidly for the
                    Old Liners.102 Such were the charges made by the Republicans
                    over the entire state against their allies. They found one grain of consolation
                    however. If the Americans had gone in a body for Willard, that vote would be
                    drawn off for their own candidate in the November election, and Fremont, if such
                    were the case, would be certain of carrying Indiana.103
                    Therein may lie the explanation of the charges. The Republicans made great
                    political capital out of them for the next month and on them based their hope of
                    success.
            The Americans of course were indignant. They claimed to have kept their promises
                    and to have supported the ticket in spite of the treatment received at the last
                    Fusion convention. At any rate, a comparison of the vote with that in the coming
                    November election would show where the American vote had gone.104

                            Journal, October 30, 1856. It is interesting, but
                            there is no other evidence as to its truth.
                        The terms of a Democratic and Know Nothing coalition were claimed to have
                            been learned by a Republican, who gained access to an American council.
                            rThe Americans had made a proposition to the Republicans, it was said,
                            to vote the Republicn ticket in October, provided that
                            "Dick" Thompson would be elected 
                                United States
                             senator, but the Republicans refused. The proposition was
                            then made to the Old Liners and accepted. The Americans then voted the
                            Democratic ticket in October, but the combination failed to secure
                            control of the state senate.
                    
            
            
            This soreness put an end, at least for the time being, to the
                    alliance that had begun between the Know Nothings and the anti-
                        Nebraska
                     men in 1854. With the single exception of a Republican and American
                    meeting in 
                  Vevay, Switzerland
                county, not a proposal was to
                    be heard for a fusion electoral ticket.105
                    The Republican cry now was that the day for fusion had passed,
                    the pandering to the Fillmore element was over.106 There
                    must be no more affiliation with Fillmoreism. It had
                    retarded–not helped–the growth of Republicanism in the southern half of the state.107 The
                    "treacherous" Know Nothings were supposed to be determined to
                    defeat Fremont if they had to elect Buchanan to do so.108
            
            Three of the Fillmore electors followed Orth and Sheets in their desertion of the
                    American party and announced their intention of supporting Fremont and 
                        Dayton
                    . They were Andrew Osborne, elector-at-large;
                    Thomas A. Stanfield, in the Ninth district, and John B. Howe, in the Tenth. The American attitude on the slavery question was given as the reason for their action.109 Their
                    places were taken by Richard W. Thompson, George W. Blakemore, and J. McNutt
                    Smith, respectively.110
            
            The Americans realized that their candidate could not hope to carry the election,
                    but they did believe that Fillmore would carry enough states to prevent either
                    Buchanan or Fremont from securing a majority in the electoral college. The
                    Democrats 
                  
                            Again the Americans proposed to J. D. Defrees, chairman of the
                                Republican state central committee, to form a fusion electoral
                                ticket, on which there were to be three or four Americans. Defrees
                                refused, whereupon the same plan was laid before the Democrats and
                                accepted.
                            Such a story might appear plausible at the time, but no such
                                Democratic-American fusion ticket appeared, and it will be shown
                                that the Americans, as a whole, did support the People's
                                ticket in October, 1856.

                            ledger, Nov. 1, 1856. The Fillmore electors in the
                            Fourth and Eighth districts, Colonel William B. White and C. W. Prather,
                            were doubtful in their support of the American candidate. The former was
                            said to favor Buchanan, the latter, Fremont. But their names remained on
                            the electoral ticket. See the 
                                Rockport
                            
                            Democrat, August 2, 1856, and the 
                                Terre Haute
                            
                            Express, August 14, 1856.
               
                     were expected to carry most of the southern
                    states, the Republicans the north, and the Americans the border states. If those
                    circumstances came to pass the election would be thrown into the house of
                    representatives. It was regarded as certain that neither Fremont nor Buchanan,
                    as sectional candidates, could command the support of the house. Fillmore then
                    would be the logical compromise candidate whom both sections could support.111
            
            An attempt, based upon such calculations, was made to withdraw the Fillmore
                    ticket in Indiana. On October 29, J. R. Thompson, a Fillmore man of 
                        New York
                    , brought letters from Mr. Jewett, of the 
                        New York
                     state council, and from the president of the American national
                    council to Colonel R. W. Thompson of 
                        Terre Haute
                    . He called on Major A. H. Davidson, of the Indiana state central
                    committee, and presented the letters. It was the desire of Fillmore and the 
                        New York
                     Americans to give Indiana to Fremont, which would increase
                    Fillmore's chances of throwing the election into the house of
                    representatives. Major Davidson said it could be done by the concurrence of the
                    American state central committee, and advised Mr. Thompson to see Colonel R. W.
                    Thompson on the subject. He did so, but the latter declined to withdraw the
                    ticket on the ground that it was too late to do so and swing the Fillmore vote
                    to Fremont.112 Rumors spread that the ticket had been
                    withdrawn. The state central committee met November 3, and issued a statement,
                    signed by A. H. Davidson, William G. Armstrong, and Milton Gregg, which denied
                    the rumors to that effect, or that there had been any fusion with either of the
                    other parties, and called on the Americans to stand firm in support of their
                        candidate.113
            
            A few days previous to the presidential election the American state central
                    committee issued a circular, signed by A. H. Davidson, William G. Armstrong,
                    Milton Gregg, C. C. Butler, J. W. Stratton, and G. W. Blakemore, which defined

                     voters of Indiana the American position on
                    the slavery question. On the repeal of the 
                        Missouri
                     Compromise it stated: 
                        The men in Indiana, who support the election of Fillmore and Donelson,
                            regard the repeal of the 
                                Missouri
                             Compromise by the party now in power, as unwise and
                            deserving the condemnation of the American people. It was a measure
                            adopted for party purposes, unjust in its conception, and fraught with
                            imminent danger to the integrity of the union. It has produced discord,
                            sectional strife, and internal war, and the extent of evil consequent
                            upon its repeal is impossible now to determine.
                    
            
            The address proceeded to urge the freemen of Indiana to vote for Fillmore in
                    preference to Fremont because: 
                        Should Mr. Fillmore be president, the probability for a restoration of
                                the Compromise, or an equivalent measure, would be
                            far more likely to take place, because a recommendation from him would
                            have weight, and receive consideration from members of Congress
                            representing all portions of the Union.
                    
            
            The position was made still stronger by the following declaration: 
                        We are opposed to the extension of the 
                                Missouri
                             Compromise line. We are opposed to any interference with
                            the existing institutions of our sister State.114
                  
                    
            
            The position assumed by the central committee in this statement was almost
                    identical with that of the Republicans. It represented the attitude of Milton
                    Gregg and others of his stamp on the committee, but it certainly did not reflect
                    the opinions of the South Americans of the "Pocket." The
                    purpose of the circular is not stated, but the time of its appearance and its
                    character would suggest that it was intended for the consumption of the voters
                    of central Indiana and was designed to stop the secession to the ranks of the
                    Republicans that was constant there.
            As the election drew near it was seen that, while the struggle between Buchanan
                    and Fremont would probably be close, Fillmore would run a poor third in the
                    state. Practically all the straw votes taken forecast the result. The election
                    came

                     were charged with a trick commonly practiced in that day. They
                    printed a peculiarly spotted ballot in order to detect any American who did not
                    vote for Fillmore.115
            
            The votes for Fillmore amounted to 22,386 out of an aggregate vote of 235,434.
                    Following is the official vote by counties for the leading elector on each
                        ticket.116 The result of the October state election is
                    given also,117 so that by a comparison of the vote it may be
                    shown whether or not the Americans supported the People's ticket in
                    1856.

            The Americans supported the Republican nominees for congress and the Fusion
                    carried five out of the eleven districts.118
            
            The results of the election disproved the assertion that the Americans had not
                    supported Morton in October. Buchanan received but 691 votes more than Willard.
                    Morton received 17,763 votes more than Fremont. The Fillmore vote of 22,386 had
                    evidently been subtracted from the strength of Morton, not of Willard. In twenty
                    counties of southern Indiana119 the Willard and Buchanan
                    strength remained practically the same, 25,761 and 26,528. Morton received
                    18,536 votes in the same counties, which was approximately the sum of the number
                    polled by Fillmore, 13,229, and Fremont, 6,038. A study of the figures in some
                    counties gives even more interesting results. In 
                        Daviess county
                     Fremont polled but 26 votes; the 912 of Morton must have come from
                    the 939 received by

                     Fillmore. In 
                        Ohio county
                     Morton had received 465 votes; Fillmore received 370, and Fremont
                    104, while Buchanan and Willard polled the same number, 505. A study of the
                    figures in 
                  Clark, Floyd, Gibson,
                            Harrison, Spencer, Orange
               , or any county where there was an appreciable
                    American element, leads to but one conclusion, namely, the supporters of Morton
                    were those of Fremont plus those of Fillmore.
            It is a question whether or not the presence of the American ticket in the
                    campaign led to the loss of the state for Fremont. The 
                        Louisville
                    
                    Journal, a South American organ, claimed that the Fillmore
                    party performed a service by defeating a sectional party in the state. Many
                    supporters of Fillmore in Indiana believed the same thing.120 From the radical wing of the Republicans came the statement that if
                    they had not shown so much deference to Know Nothingism and had made a bold
                    fight in southern Indiana instead of abandoning it to Fillmore, the state would
                    have been saved for Fremont.121 But Buchanan received a
                    majority over both candidates of 1,910. The question arises
                    also that even if the American ticket had been withdrawn according to the scheme
                    referred to above, would the pure Americans of the river counties and the
                    "Pocket" have voted for the "abolitionist,"
                    Fremont? It is not probable.
            The 
                        New Albany
                    
                    Tribune and the moderate Americans generally laid the
                    responsibility for the loss of the second great battle of the People upon the
                    ultra fanaticism of the 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    Journal and other papers that bore the stamp of
                        sectionalism.122
            
            The American party as a factor in national politics ended with this campaign, its
                    first and last. Fillmore received a large vote, but carried the single state of 
                        Maryland
                     with its eight electoral votes. For some time it remained a factor
                    in Indiana state politics, but with ever decreasing importance. American
                    sentiment lingered in the southern portion of the state until, in the face of
                    the question of union or disunion, it disappeared.

            Decline of the American Party
            
            There remains the task of tracing the fortunes of the remnant of the American
                    party which still persisted in southern Indiana, nominally at least a factor in
                    local politics. It was recognized that their importance as a power in politics
                    was gone, and evidence of the fact was not lacking.
            The American Union club, as the Fillmore club of 
                        Indianapolis
                     was called, announced that it would support Thomas E. Holbrook for
                    mayor, and John D. Perrine for clerk, at the city election, which was to be held
                    November 22, 1856. The former declined to run, but Perrine received 73 votes.1 In practically the same territory Fillmore had received
                    152 votes, which showed a falling off of over half from his strength.2 The Americans supported the Republican candidate for
                    mayor, who was successful. This was the only time the Americans ever contested a
                    city election in 
                        Indianapolis
                    .
            The Americans in the state legislature acted and voted generally with the
                    Republicans, but in some instances with the Democrats.3
                    Although but few in number, their support was essential to the Republicans. This
                    was especially true in the Senate, where the Americans and the Anti-Lecompton
                    Democrats held the balance of power. In the election of 
                        United States
                     senators the Fillmore men in the house cast two votes for George G.
                    Dunn and Richard W. Thompson. In the senate the Americans acted with the
                    Republicans by refusing to go into a joint session. The result was the election
                    of two Democratic senators, Graham N. Fitch and Jesse D. Bright, although there
                    was no quorum present.4
            
            The American newspapers began an agitation for a state convention in order to
                    determine the course they should pursue in regard to state and national
                        policy.5 In response to the demand the state central
                    committee issued a call for a convention

                        Indianapolis
                     February 17, 1857.6 In some instances, as at 
                        Terre Haute
                    , delegates were appointed by American mass meetings, but generally
                    no primary was necessary. Every member choosing to go was recognized as a
                        delegate.7
            
            A scanty handful of delegates answered the call and appeared in the supreme court
                    room on the day designated. An organization was there effected and a committee
                    on resolutions appointed, consisting of R. W. Thompson, Milton Gregg, P. S.
                    Sage, Zalmon Tousey, and Lewis Holmes, after which the convention adjourned to
                    the hall of the house of representatives.8 There Colonel
                    William E. White, of 
                        Aurora
                    , was appointed president, with William H. Gregory, of the Rising
                    Sun Visitor, and F. Y. Carlisle, of the 
                        Evansville
                    
                    Journal, secretaries.9 After addresses by
                    R. W. Thompson and Milton Gregg, a series of resolutions was reported by the
                    committee. This platform declared for the preservation of the Union; opposed all
                    interference with the institutions of the states, but at the same time opposed
                    the further extension of slavery; favored internal improvements and a protective
                    tariff; would limit suffrage and office-holding to citizens; and opposed foreign
                    influence, religious or political, with the affairs of this government.10 After the adoption of this platform the body adjourned.
                    This convention represented the last effort at united action by the Americans in
                    Indiana. It accomplished nothing, but displayed their weakness. It excited
                    little interest and but few mass meetings were held to ratify its'
                        work.11

                     perhaps two from each congressional
                        district.12 How many of those attended is uncertain, as
                    mention is made of R. W. Thompson only. He, however, played a very prominent
                    part in the convention as one of the principal speakers and a member of the
                    committee on resolutions.13 The usefulness of the national
                    council had ended with the defeat of Fillmore, so the members now decided to
                    adjourn it forever. A new plan of organization was adopted in which there was no
                    provision for a grand council. The party in each state and territory was left to
                    organize as it saw fit. The national officers were elected for the ensuing year
                    and a national central committee of thirteen was provided for, with power to
                    reconvene the council if the need for it arose.14 On June 3
                    the council adjourned, and as it never met again, its career came to an end,
                    after a life of but three years.
            With the national and state organizations defunct the American party was, as the 
                        New Albany
                    
                    Tribune said, "dead if not damned." It was
                    regarded as a thing of the past. Some of its chief organs, as the 
                        Vevay
                    
                    Reveille, dropped politics and concluded to be neutral.13 The election of 1857, in which 
                        Kentucky
                     and 
                        Tennessee
                     were both lost, demonstrated that their political power was gone.
                    With the exception of a few city officers in 
                        New Albany
                     and 
                        Jeffersonville
                    , the Americans won no successes in the city elections of 1857. Even
                    in the former place, the center of Know Nothingism in the state, some of their
                    candidates were defeated.16
            
            The Americans felt themselves helpless. Fortunately there would be no important
                    election until the next year, 1858, so there was no motive for immediate action.
                    The best policy, as they felt, was to remain quiet, watch the movements of
                    parties and strike at the first favorable opportunity.17 In
                    some quarters a union with the Republicans was favorably considered. Certainly
                    neither party would relinquish its

                     cherished principles for the sake of a
                    coalition, but the platform of the old Whig party was put forward by Milton
                    Gregg as a common ground upon which all might unite.18 But
                    however favorable the more liberal Americans might be toward a union, those of 
                        Vigo
                     were not disposed to any fusion, but believed in sticking to
                    straight American principles. At a meeting at 
                        Terre Haute
                     in May, 1857, resolutions were adopted not to affiliate with any
                    party, to make no nominations, to leave each American voter to act as he saw
                    fit; and, in 
                        Vigo
                    , the party would resume action in a national or state canvass.19 Likewise the American party in 
                        Lafayette
                     refused to affiliate with the Republicans.20
            
            Non-attention to the slavery question was made the leading issue of
                        Americanism.21 They purposed to establish a party having
                    a higher mission than to excite hatred between north and south. Slavery, where
                    it existed, or in the 
                        District of Columbia
                    , or the interstate slave trade, did not concern the∗
                    free states. The policy of the Americans was to take the question out of
                    congress and out of political contests; to let it alone entirely. To uphold
                    those principles the party would refuse to unite with any sectional party. Such
                    was their stand as expressed by R. W. Thompson.22 The 
                        Terre Haute
                    
                    Union, now the chief organ of the straight Americans, lamented
                    the fact that so many had fallen away from those principles. The third degree
                    had been adopted to get rid of the slavery question, and many had bound
                    themselves by the oath to let it alone. "Some have remained true to the
                    pledge. Where are the remainder? Echo answers–where?"23 Upon the question of the right of congress to legislate
                    upon the slavery question the Americans disagreed. The 
                        New Albany
                    
                    Tribune opposed the stand of the 
                        Vigo
                     Americans and held that it had constitutional right to do so.24
            
            The Republicans were divided upon the question of conciliating the Americans. The
                    feeling of the majority was

                     that they had conceded too much in the
                    past. Accusations were still made that the Americans had double-crossed them in
                    the election of 1856 and were still in active alliance with the Democrats.23 The Fillmore men were said to show even less feeling than
                    many Democrats against the Lecompton swindle.20 A majority
                    of the Republican papers called for a straight out Republican convention to
                    nominate candidates for the state campaign of 1858. Very few proposed another
                    fusion convention.27
            
            The Republican convention was held at 
                        Indianapolis
                    , March 4, 1858. No tenders were made to the Americans to attend,
                    and while the convention was full of former Know Nothings, they were present as
                    full-fledged Republicans.28
            
            Not a single concession on the ticket was made to the Americans, although a fair
                    ratio would have given them one or probably two of the nine candidates, and no
                    plank was incorporated in the platform that hinted of Americanism.29 Quite unlike the convention of 1854, naturalized Germans took
                    prominent parts and a German and an Englishman were placed upon the ticket. It
                    was evidently more profitable to bid for the foreign than the nativist vote.
            Although the Americans had received little or no consideration from the

                    Tribune believed that the principles avowed could be supported
                    by them. Milton Gregg decided to work for the election of the ticket and called
                    upon the Americans to do so. But their support should be given as individuals;
                    as a party they should not commit themselves.30 The party
                    virtually took this position in the campaign.
            A few local elections were held in the spring of 1858. The Americans won partial
                    victories in 
                  New Albany,
                            Terre Haute
               , and other
                    towns of southern Indiana, but the trend even there showed they were still
                    losing strength.31

            Know Nothingism had fallen into disrepute in central and northern Indiana by
                    1858. The term became one of opprobrium and to prove that a candidate was a
                    "Know Nothing of 1854" would hurt his chances for election.32
            
            The Know Nothings in 1858 were looked upon with somewhat the same disfavor as
                    were the Harford convention Federalists in 1830.
            The American party of 
                        Terre Haute
                     held a meeting March 29, 1858, to determine which of the two state
                    tickets they should support.33 Under the influence of R. W.
                    Thompson and William K. Edwards they took a conservative, national stand and did
                    not commit themselves to the support of either state ticket. An American state
                    convention to be held at 
                        Indianapolis
                    , July 2, was suggested, but as there was little enthusiasm in the
                    American cause no notice was taken of the proposal.
            In other parts of the state the desire to defeat the Lecompton Democrats made the
                    Americans more favorable toward fusion. In 
                        Ohio
                    , Switerland, 
                        Spencer
                    , and other counties they united with the Republicans upon their
                        candidates.34 In other counties, such as 
                        Clay
                     and Lawrence, the opposition put both Americans and Republicans
                    upon a joint ticket.
            Further testimony of the more liberal spirit pervading Americanism is furnished
                    by the fact that the Seymour Times recommended the support of
                    the opposition state ticket, even though there were some citizens of foreign
                    birth or descent upon it.35
            
            In the same spirit the 
                        New Albany
                    
                    Tribune hoped that no American would scratch Judge Otto merely
                    because he was of German blood.36
            
            The Democrats who had joined the Know Nothing councils in 1854 had generally gone
                    back to their own party. W. M. Ray, the Lecompton candidate for congress in the
                    Sixth district, had been a Know Nothing.37

            The combined efforts of the Republicans, Americans, and anti-Lecompton Democrats
                    succeeded in electing eight out of eleven congressmen, but the state ticket was
                        defeated.38 The combination elected one American state
                    senator, Benjamin Robinson, of 
                        Ohio
                     and 
                        Switzerland
                    , and at least six Americans to the house, namely, William K.
                    Edwards and John P. Baird, of 
                        Vigo
                    ; James E. Blythe, of Vanderburg; R. Boyd, of Lawrence; William H.
                    Gregory, of 
                        Ohio
                     and 
                        Switzerland
                    , and Smith Jones, of 
                        Bartholomew
                    .39 Some local victories were won by the
                    Americans in 
                        Lawrence county
                     and elsewhere, but as a separate party they usually ran third.40
            
            A study of the vote in those counties where the Americans were strong shows that
                    they had voted almost unanimously for the opposition ticket.41 The success of the Republicans and Americans brought out pleas for a
                    closer union from the 
                        New Albany
                    
                    Tribune. Now that the platform of the two parties was almost
                    the same, there was no necessity for their remaining apart. The lesson of the
                    election should not be lost.42
            
            The Americans and Republicans in the legislature could do little, as they were in
                    the minority. William H. Gregory, American-Republican from 
                        Ohio county
                    , introduced a bill contemplating an amendment to the state
                    constitution that would limit the right of suffrage to those who are citiens of
                    the 
                        United States
                     either by birth or naturalization. Such a bill

                     40 The falling off of the American vote is shown
                            by the vote in 
                                Spencer county
                            , where Fillmore had polled 808 votes. In 1858 the vote on
                            county treasurer stood: Leeompton, 986; Anti-Lecompton, 882; American,
                            216. For sheriff: Leeompton, 814; Anti-Lecompton, 770; American, 426;
                            Republican, 86. From the

                            41 For example the vote of the following counties
                            taken at random from among those where the Americans were numerous,
                            shows that the vote for Peele, the Opposition candidate for secretary of
                            state, is the sum of the vote for Fremont in 1856, plus that for
                            Fillmore.

                     had been introduced in the legislature of
                    1855, but as in that case, nothing was done with it.43
            
            Throughout the year 1859 the Americans were maneuvering for a recognition which
                    the Republicans were unwilling to concede. While sympathizing with the aims of
                    the latter party, they stood aloof and watched the progress of events. The
                    Americans would continue to pursue a policy of masterly inactivity because the
                    Republicans were too sectional. Yet harmonious action was necessary because the
                    latter could not succeed without American aid. If the Republican party would
                    pursue a more liberal policy and plant itself upon a platform upon which all the
                    elements of the opposition could stand, the Americans gave assurance of hearty
                    co-operation. Such a combination would be necessary to carry Indiana and the few
                    other doubtful states which were necessary for success.44
                    
                        Without a distinct renunciation of some of the leading objects of
                            Republicanism, and a stop to the agitation of the slavery question by
                            the Republicans, there can be no union–no coalition with the
                            elements of the opposition,
                     was the stand of the 
                        Evansville
                    
                    Journal. The Americans would insist that all useless agitation
                    should cease and that extreme views should be repudiated. On the other hand,
                    they would just as firmly resist the aggressions of the slave power and they
                    repudiated the heresy that the constitution carried slavery into the
                        territories.45
            
            The Americans, in the belief that they held the balance of power in the state,
                    threatened to put out a separate ticket unless the Republicans gave them and the
                    old Whigs some recognition in the state convention. The 
                        New Albany
                    
                    Tribune formulated a series of demands which represented the
                    views of the Americans. They were as follows: 
                  That an 'Opposition' convention be called in which
                            Republicans, Americans and Whigs shall participate, fully, freely, and
                            fairly. 
                        
                           43

                                    Tribune, December 14, 1858. Mention is made in
                                    the 
                                        Indianapolis
                                    
                                    Sentinel, February 4-5, 1859, of a convention
                                    supposed to have been held at 
                                        Indianapolis
                                    , February 3, of Americans, Whigs and conservative
                                    men. The Sentinel says that the convention
                                    must have been small for its reporter could not find it. Whether
                                    such a convention or meeting was ever held is uncertain for
                                    there is no other mention of it anywhere.

                  That no man entertaining ultra views upon the slavery question shall
                            be nominated for any office.
                  That the platform adopted shall be national, and not
                            sectional–conservative and not radical.
                  That the delegates to the National Convention shall be instructed to
                            vote for Bates, Bell or Corwin for President.46
                  
               
            
            The Americans demanded to enter the partnership upon equal terms or not at all.
                    If the Republicans merely gave them and the Whigs a cold invitation to
                    participate in a "Republican" convention, there would be no
                    fusion and the success of the Democrats was assured.
            The first demand of the Tribune was complied with. A
                    "Mass State Convention" was summoned to meet at 
                        Indianapolis
                    , February 22, 1860. The term Republican was studiously avoided. The
                    call was signed by Thomas C. Slaughter, of Harrison, and Godlove O. Behm, of 
                        Tippecanoe
                    , both Know Nothings of 1854.47 The Americans
                    responded generally to the call. In 
                        Ohio county
                     the first Fusion convention since 1854 was held to send delegates
                    to the state convention. The Rising Sun Visitor said: 
                        In this state we are glad to perceive that the Republicans have been
                            growing more liberal, while the Americans, knowing that there is no
                            affinity betwen them and the Democrats, are now willing to stand upon
                            common grounds with the Republicans.48
                  
                    
            
            The Americans hoped to be represented upon the ticket by one or possibly two
                    candidates. The 
                        Terre Haute
                    
                    Union suggested R. W. Thompson as a suitable candidate for
                    governor. While he might not be acceptable to the radical Republicans, he would
                    gain many conservative votes.49 William H. Gregory, of
                    Rising Sun, was to be supported by the Americans for secretary of state.50 But as the convention drew near the Americans began to
                    doubt that they would be given any consideration. The 
                        New Albany
                    
                    Tribune complained that Gregory had received no support; only
                    straight Republicans had a 
                  
                     46

                     chance; the Republican leaders were
                    preparing to control the convention; and the American delegation would be
                        wholly-powerless.51
            
            The ticket nominated by the convention was but partially acceptable to the
                    Americans, according to the Tribune.
               52
                    Henry S. Lane would receive their cordial support for governor, but they had no
                    use for Oliver P. Morton, a Loco-Foco. Because William H. Gregory, the American
                    choice, had received no consideration from the convention, his successful
                    opponent, W. H. Peele, of Randolph, could not be supported. Albert Lange, of 
                        Vigo
                    , and Jonathan S. Harvey, of Clark, might expect American votes. But
                    the candidate that saved the ticket was James G. Jones, of Vanderburg, a
                    "Bloody K. N." Fillmore elector of 1856, and a firm and
                    consistent American, who was nominated for attorney-general. The Republicans
                    overshot their mark, however, when they attempted to convert Americans into
                    Republicans by wholesale. The nominees of an "Opposition"
                    convention were labelled a "Republican" ticket.53
            
            The American party, by contesting neither the state nor national elections, lost
                    its identity and disappeared during the compaign. Its members were merged into
                    other parties and the issues of Americanism were swallowed up by the greater
                    ones of slavery and secession.
            Those who still sought to escape the slavery question took refuge in the
                    Constitutional Union movement which originated in the first months of I860.54 The membership of this party consisted almost entirely of
                    former Americans. The machinery of the American party in Indiana became that of
                    the Constitutional Union party.
            A. H. Davidson, chairman of the American executive committee in 1856, called a
                    meeting of the general committee of the Constitutional Union party to be held at 
                        Indianapolis
                    , April 12, 1860. True, his action was somewhat presumptive, for the
                    new party was not identical with the old American

                    55 A number of former Americans answered the call. The
                    convention selected delegates to attend the 
                        Baltimore
                     national convention,56 most of whom have been
                    mentioned as members of the American party, namely, R. W. Thompson, of 
                        Vigo
                    ; J. J. Hayden, of

                        Gibson

                    .57 The executive central committee likewise
                    consisted largely of former Americans, as follows: Lewis Howes, of Vanderburg;
                    Dennis Gregg, of 
                        Floyd
                    ; J. D. Thomasson, of Lawrence; J. J. Hayden, of

            The Rising Sun Visitor and the Seymour Times,
                    two of the few remaining American papers, refused to support the Bell-Everett
                    movement on the ground that it would merely serve to divide the opposition and

            The state convention of the new party was held at 
                        Indianapolis
                    , August 15, 1860. Among the old Americans present were: A. H.
                    Davidson and Zalmon Tousey, of 
                        Marion
                    ; J. J. Hayden, of 
                        Ohio
                    ; J. D. Thomasson, of Lawrence; Captain Meekin and Dennis Gregg, of 
                        Floyd
                    ; F. Y. Carlisle and J. E. Blythe, of Vanderburg; R. W. Thompson and
                    W. K. Edwards, of 
                        Vigo
                    . An electoral ticket and a platform were put out, but no state
                    ticket was nominated.59
            
            Most of the American leaders went into the new party, but not all. David T. Laird
                    became a Democrat and was a candidate 
                  
                     55

                            only R. W. Thompson played a prominent part there. He was one of the

                        Spencer county
                    .60 The Douglas Democrats, who had combined with
                    the Americans in certain southern states, made persistent efforts to secure
                    American support in Indiana, but met with little success.61
                    R. W. Thompson was opposed to any such union on the ground that it would swallow
                    up Americanism.
            The Americans in many portions of the state came out for "Lincoln.62 The 
                        New Albany
                    
                    Tribune advised Fillmore men to vote for Lincoln because he
                    opposed negro equality or interference with slavery in the 
                        District of Columbia
                    ; opposed the extension of slave territory; and favored the
                    enforcement of the fugitive slave law.63
            
            At the state election, which came in October, the Americans supported the
                    Opposition ticket almost unanimously, as the vote of the various counties shows.
                    Taking those counties where the Americans had polled a large vote in 1856, the
                    result in 1860 shows that Lane received a vote approximately equal to that of
                    both Fremont and Fillmore, while 
                        Hendricks
                     received practically the same as Willard. The greater portion of
                    Lane's vote in southern Indiana must have come from former
                        Americans.64
            
            The Constitutional Union party polled but 5,306 votes in the entire state,
                    practically all of which came from the American districts. This party's
                    strength in 1860 was in each county about twenty-five per cent of the American
                    strength in 1856. This leads to but one conclusion–the Constitutional
                    Unionists were practically all former Americans and about one-fourth of the
                    Fillmore vote went to Bell and Everett.

                        Journal, December 4, 1860, for the official vote of all
                        counties.
            
            
            In the presidential election in November Lincoln made tremendous gains over the
                    Fremont vote in southern Indiana. Three-fourths of the Fillmore men must have
                    voted for him. The old Know Nothings of 1854 were becoming Republicans in 1860.
                    The figures for the election show this conclusively. While the combined vote of
                    Douglas and Breckenridge varied little from that of Buchanan, the Lincoln and
                    Bell vote equaled that of Fremont and Fillmore, but the proportions were
                        reversed.65
            
            Most of the Know Nothings of 1854, as we have seen, sooner or later found their
                    way into the Republican party. Those with the most pronounced anti-slavery views
                    had followed Orth, Colfax, and Cumback, in the first secession, which came after
                    the introduction of the third degree and the adoption of the "twelfth
                    section" platform in 1855. The long alliance with the Republicans in
                    the Fusion movements, 1854-60, made the step easier after the defeat of
                    Fillmore. Those who still remained too conservative went to the Republicans by
                    the way of the Constitutional Union party. Among the last were many of the
                    leaders, including R. W. Thompson, who became active and prominent as a
                    Republican.
            Thus the Know Nothing party passed quietly out of existence. Its career had been
                    as stormy as it had been brief. But the Know Nothings were not to blame, for
                    they must be judged by the standards of the time. They engaged in riots, but
                    this was the period of Civil war in 
                        Kansas
                     and of John Brown's raid. Politics never were more bitter
                    than in those years, 1854-60. They hated their opponents and were as cordially
                    hated in return.
            It is difficult to justify their principles. But as it is still 
                  
                            65 The result in the following counties is

                            Journal, December 14, 1860, for the vote in all

                     possible to arouse religious prejudice and
                    the fear of "pauper foreigners," can we wonder that in those
                    trying times our countrymen became alarmed? There are still believers in great
                    conspiracies.
            The most repellant feature of the organization was its secret political method.
                    Such methods are certainly incompatible with Democratic ideals. They can be
                    justified only in the case of a downtrodden people struggling for their rights.
            The Know Nothing order left but a slight impress upon our politics or
                    institutions. It served as a demonstration that any attempt at ecclesiastical
                    control would be successfully resisted. In the same way it was a protest against
                    immigrants who refuse to become Americanized–by no means a dead issue
                    in this day of the "hyphenated" American. The Know Nothing
                    movement served as a convenient means to bridge over the gap made by the
                    disappearance of the Whig party until the time was ripe for the appearance of
                    the Republican party. The long association with the latter party, and the fact
                    that most of the northern Know Nothings later joined it, was a great factor in
                    determining the policy of that party with respect to the period of
                    naturalization.
            In conclusion we may say that the sincerity of the men who joined the order of
                    the Star-Spangled Banner can not be questioned. They believed that they were
                    combatting great dangers which threatened our freedom and they made use of the
                    means which seemed most likely to insure success.
         
         
         
            Historical News
            THE INDIANA HISTORICAL COMMISSION
            
            June 18 at Waverly Beach, 
                        Porter county
                    , Indiana, the Dune-Kankakee historical society was formed, the
                    newest sectional historical association in Indiana. The occasion of the meeting
                    was a joint session of the historical societies from 
                  Lake, Porter
               , Laporte, and 
                        St. Joseph
                     counties, held in connection with the Dunes summer camp program. At
                    this joint meeting emphasis was placed upon cooperation among the counties of
                    northwestern Indiana, particularly those situated in the Dune-Kankakee region.
                    It is the plan of the society to include in its organization in addition to the
                    four counties above named, 
                  Marshall,
                            Starke, Jasper
                and Benton. The officers elected include:
                    George B. Beitner of 
                        South Bend
                    , president; Louis J. Bailey of 
                        Gary
                    , vice president; Mrs. J. H. Willey of Plymouth, secretary. The
                    society will hold at least one regular meeting a year, following the plan of the
                    Southwestern Indiana historical society, by holding their meetings from time to
                    time in the different counties.
            The semi-annual meting of the Southwestern Indiana historical society met June 1
                    at 
                        New Harmony
                    . Approximately two hundred persons attended the meeting and enjoyed
                    not only the interesting papers that had been prepared, but more particularly
                    the historical pilgrimage through the village of 
                        New Harmony
                    . Two papers of special interest were: "Historical 
                        New Harmony
                    " by Miss Louise Husband; and "General Thomas
                    Posey' by Judge John E. Iglehart, president of the society. A memorial
                    tribute was paid to the late Judge Arthur H. Taylor, vice president of the 
                        Pike County
                     historical society.
            June 24, 1922, one hundred and forty-four years to the day from the time when
                    Gen. George Rogers Clark departed from the falls of the Ohio
                    river with his little army of less than two hundred men on that
                    historical conquest which led to the capture of Kaskaskia, Cahokia and 
                        Vincennes
                    , a marker was unveiled, located near the site where General
                    Clark's old home stood. Following the brilliant success that attended
                    the  numerous military conquests of General
                    Clark, he settled down in a log cabin which stood on the banks of the
                        Ohio river where he spent the later days of his life.
                    The Ann Rogers Clark chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution, the
                    Indiana society of the Sons of the Revolution, and the Indiana historical
                    commission united in placing the marker that was unveiled near Clark's
                    old home in Clarksville
            July 4, the Indiana Historical Commission and the Hoosier automobile association
                    dedicated a marker, a few miles southeast of 
                        Kokomo
                     on the Pumpkinville pike, on the side of the road where an
                    automobile made its first successful trial run in America, July 4, 1894. The car
                    was designed and invented by Elwood Haynes, Kokomo, and now is one of the
                    permanent exhibits in the Smithsonian Institution in 
                        Washington
                    , D. C. This "horseless" car, for such it was
                    called, was by special consent loaned to the committee in charge of the
                    exercises, and was brought all the way from 
                        Washington
                     to 
                        Kokomo
                     where it was on exhibit for three days.
            June 14, a massive boulder marking the site of the last French fort built in
                    Indiana, was unveiled in 
                        Fort Wayne
                    . The marker was erected and dedicated by the Mary Penrose Wayne
                    chapter, D. A. R. The inscription on the bronze tablet calls attention to the
                    fact that the last fort was erected in 1750; surrendered to the British in 1760;
                    Ensign Richard Holmes and the British garrison were massacred by the 
                        Miami
                     Indians on this spot in 1763; and that a battle was fought there
                    October 22, 1790 between Gen. Joseph Hamar and the 
                        Miami
                     Indians led by Little Turtle.
            A marker at the grave of Thomas Montgomery, Revolutionary soldier and pioneer
                    settler in 
                        Gibson county
                    , whither he came in 1806, was dedicated on Sunday, June 18, 1922.
                    The cemetery in which Thomas Montgomery lies, is located back of Miller
                    Montgomery's (grandson) home. Historical papers and addresses were read
                    by Zack Emerson of Cynthiana, Mrs. George R. Simpson, a descendant of Thomas
                    Montgomery, and Judge Lucius Embree, vice president of the 
                        Gibson County
                     historical society.
            July 3, a marker was dedicated in Shelbyville, Indiana, on the site of the first
                    railroad built west of the Allegheny 
                    mountains. Judge W. J. Peasley, one of the early settlers in 
                        Shelby county
                    , during the early part of the year 1834, built a road one and
                    one-half miles long just east of Shelbyville, consisting of wooden ties and
                    rails, on which the cars were drawn by horse power. The formal opening of the
                    road occurred July 4,1834, and a parade which formed at the courthouse marched
                    to the western terminus of the road. A company of light infantry followed by
                    Revolutionary soldiers, and a committee of citizens formed the parade. Also
                    twenty-five little girls dressed in white, trimmed with blue, bearing the
                    banners of the several states at that time, were in the line of march.
            June 14 and 15, 1922, 
                        Rush county
                     held its centennial celebration, commemorating the one hundred
                    year's growth of the county since its organization in 1822. Under the
                    direction of Miles S. Cox, chairman of the executive committee, considerable
                    preliminary work had been carried on along educational lines through the schools
                    of the county, clubs, civic and fraternal organizations, acquainting the
                    citizens of the county with the developments that had occurred during the last
                    century. The centennial exercises extended over two days, and an historical
                    parade, addresses and a pageant were the main fatures of the celebration. A
                    large collection of historical relics was brought together in Rushville for this
                    occasion. Not only were the store windows filled with valuable historical
                    relics, but a newly constructed garage was turned over to the committee and in
                    this spacious building relics and exhibits of rare value were on display. A
                    pageant depicting the growth of different townships in 
                        Rush county
                     concluded the celebration.
            An outgrowth of the 
                        Rush county
                     centennial was the organization of a 
                        Rush County
                     historical society, organized June 14. The officers elected are
                    Miles S. Cox, president; Mary Sleeth, secretary; and A. L. Gary, treasurer.
            Another centennial celebration that deserves special mention was that held in 
                        Shelby county
                    , July 4, 1922. An historical parade, in which the different
                    townships of the county were represented, formed the chief historical feature of
                    the celebration. The "spirit of 1776", followed by the
                    soldiers  of various wars, led the parade.
                    The industrial, commercial and agricultural interests of the county were also
                    represented. Conestoga wagon, floats of George Washington, "The Bears
                    of Blue River" and other scenes and exhibits
                    characteristic of 
                        Shelby county
                     history were included in the parade. A special exhibit of relics
                    was on display in the various store windows about the public square. Historical
                    addresses were made at the fair grounds by ex-governor George Kendall of 
                        Iowa
                    ; a native of 
                        Shelby county
                    ; sex-mayor Charles W. Jewett of 
                        Indianapolis
                    ; Rev. James E. Montgomery of 
                        Washington
                    , D. C., chaplain of the house of representatives. Spurred on by the
                    historical interests that had been awakened during the celebration, Dr. Samuel
                    Kennedy, one of Shelbyville's most prominent citizens, announced he
                    would donate a lot to the 
                        Shelby county
                     historical society if one were organized, to be used for erecting
                    and maintaining a building thereon, to house 
                        Shelby county
                    's historical records and relics. On Thursday night, August
                    3, a meeting was called in Shelbyville at which the 
                        Shelby County
                     historical society was organized. Miss Lucy Elliott represented the
                    historical commission at this meeting. More than thirty charter members signed
                    up at the first meeting. R. W. Harrison was elected president; Lottie Chapman,
                    vice president; Mrs. Katharine Kennedy (Mrs. Samuel), secretary; Clarence
                    Crockett, treasurer. A constitution was adopted, and the society voted to hold
                    four regular meetings annually.
            
               
                        Jasper County
                     historical society and a number of interested friends numbering
                    more than fifty, toured the mound region of the central part of 
                        Jasper county
                     on Tuesday, June 20. Twin mounds were visited near Groom's
                    bridge, and a mound in the yard of the Pullin farm. Some excavations have been
                    made in the latter mound and two large sized skeletons were found in a sitting
                    posture, elbows on knees and hands on cheeks. John E. Alter, author of Hoosier Hunting Grounds, was in charge of the party and is
                    making plans for a second historical trip over the old Indian trail that
                    originally ran through 
                        Jasper county
                    . Historical pilgrimages are serving a valuable purpose in
                    acquainting the citizens of Indiana with the interesting history that lies at
                    their very doors.
            
            
                    It is worthy of note that the man who conceived and gave impetus to the rural
                        mail delivery idea was in his boyhood days a resident of 
                            Kosciusko county
                        , Indiana. Rural delivery of mail was first officially suggested
                        my Postmaster General John Wanamaker in his annual report for the fiscal
                        year of 1891. The first bill authorizing rural delivery was introduced in
                        the house of representatives January 5, 1892, by James O'Donnell,
                        member of congress from 
                            Michigan
                        . This bill carried an appropriation of $6,000,000, but failed
                        of passage. March 3, 1893, congress appropriated $10,000 for experimental
                        rural delivery. July 16 1894, the sum of $20,000 was appropriated for the
                        same purpose, and again on June 9, 1896, an additional $10,000 was
                        authorized. The first experimental rural delivery service was established
                        October 1, 1896, simultaneously on three routes, from Charleston, Uvilla and
                        Halltown, W. Va. –John B. Stoll in

                        Collegeville
                    , just south of 
                        Rensselaer
                    , an Indian school which was erected more than thirty years ago, is
                    being moved this summer to Carthagena, 
                        Ohio
                    . This Indian school was founded by Katherine Drexel. Years ago Miss
                    Drexel furnished the Indian Bureau of 
                        Washington
                    , D. C. the money necessary to purchase 240 acres of land and to
                    erect a three story building thereon where Indian boys could be educated. In
                    1888 the Community of the Most Precious Blood came into possession of the estate
                    and each year Indians from 
                  Minnesota, Wisconsin
               , the Dakotas and 
                        Michigan
                     were brought to this college where they were enrolled as students.
            The Indiana Lincoln Memorial association, organized July 10, 1922, has as its
                    object 
                        the promotion of a movement looking toward the erection and maintenance
                            of a fitting memorial to commemorate the youth of Abraham Lincoln, spent
                            upon Indiana soil; the collection, publication, and preservaton of
                            books, pamphlets, papers, maps, pictures, manuscripts, letters,
                            journals, the collection of relics and other material relating
                            especially to the youth of Lincoln, and in general to his life and
                            public career.
                    
            
            This organization was the outgrowth of a trip which twelve loyal Hoosiers, Frank
                    B. Wynn, Kate Milner Rabb, Mary Lucy Campbell, Martha E. Rihl, John W. Oliver,
                    Lucy M. Elliott, Edna B. Gearhart, Ruth L. Armstrong, Vivian K. Sowers,  Kenneth B. Cohee, Eugene C. Foster and
                    Harry Wish-ard Glossbrenner, took June 24-25, 1922 to Hodgenville, 
                        Kentucky
                    . There within the walls of the Lincoln Memorial, on the spot where
                    the martyred President was born, the "twelve apostles" pledged
                    themselves not to rest until a fitting memorial has been ereced in Indiana,
                    commemorating the youth of Lincoln, spent on Indiana soil. The officers elected
                    are: Dr. Fronk B. Wynn, president; William A. Guthrie, first vice president;
                    Harlow Lindley, second vice president; Kate Milner Rabb, secretary, and Harry W.
                    Glossbrenner, treasurer.
            DR. FRANK B. WYNN May 28, 1860-July 27, 1922
            Dr. Frank Barbour Wynn, President of the Indiana historical commission met his
                    death on July 27, 1922, while climbing Mt. Siyeh, in Glacier National park, 
                        Montana
                    . Few men in Indiana have served their state better, or rendered
                    more valuable service to its citizens than Dr. Wynn. He was born in 
                        Franklin county
                    , May 28, 1860, moved with his parents to a farm near Scipio, 
                        Jennings county
                    , in early life; graduated from Depauw university in 1883, received
                    the degree of doctor of medicine from the 
                        Ohio
                     medical college, 
                        Cincinnati
                    , 1885; and was granted an A.M. degree from Depauw university in
                    1886. In 1891 he became a member of the medical staff of the Northern hospital
                    for insane at Logan sport, Indiana. During the years 1892 to 1893 he engaged in
                    special post-graduate work in 
                        New York
                    , Berlin and Vienna. In 1893 he located in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , and in 1895 was made the city sanitarian.
            In 1895 he was appointed to the chair of Medical Diagnosis in the Indiana
                    University school of medicine, which position he held until the time of his
                    death. He stood at the very top of his profession, not only in Indiana, but in
                    the national organization as well. He founded the scientific section of the
                    American medical association and was chairman of the section for many years. In
                    1909 he was awarded the gold medal by the medical association for the best
                    tuberculosis exhibit. In  1921 Dr. Wynn was
                    elected vice president of the American medical association.
            But in the midst of his busy professional life Dr. Wynn always found time to
                    promote civic, religious, and educational movements. He led in the movement that
                    was organized in 1911, looking toward the centennial celebration of
                    Indiana's one hundred years of statehood, which occurred in 1916.
            Dr. Wynn served as vice president of the Indiana historical commission from the
                    date of its organization in 1915 until 1921, when he was elected president. He
                    was also serving as president of the Indiana Nature Study club at the time of
                    his death. Perhaps the movement that was most near to Dr. Wynn's heart
                    at the time of his death was the Indiana Lincoln Memorial association, of which
                    he was the founder. Only a few weeks before he left on his mountain climbing
                    trip he had been responsible for the organization of the Lincoln association,
                    the primary object of which is to erect a fitting memorial somewhere in Indiana,
                    dedicated to the youth of Lincoln spent upon Indiana soil. Dr. Wynn was the
                    first president of this organization.
            In his death Indiana suffers an irreparable loss. Student and scholar, a
                    scientific investigator, a humanitarian, a leader in all patriotic and
                    historical movements, a devoted student of Lincoln, and a lover of the great
                    outdoors, his character will always stand for the best type of Indiana
                manhood.
