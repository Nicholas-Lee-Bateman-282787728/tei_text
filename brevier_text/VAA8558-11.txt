        REPORTER'S NOTE.
        The closing of these volumes of Reports of the Proceedings and Debates of the Forty-Sixth
          General Assembly of the State of Indiana, combining the facile newspaper sketch with the
          moist authentic record of the action had upon every important measure of the session,
          presents occasion for stating, that, it is part of their design to show the practicability
          of reforming the fashion of journalizing employed in most of the Legislatures of the
          Union; to suggest, that the Journal Clerk of each House of the General Assembly shall be a
          Reporter, or shall be required to employ such reporting force as may enable him to sketch
          every proposition in its order and in due form, with the debate and action theroon, and
          that he be required to contract for the printing of his journal in some newspaper printed
          in the town of Indianapolis, the day after the date thereof, conditioned that it shall not
          exceed a given reasonable amount of matter, the volume of the Journals of the two Houses
          to be but one book, made up from the columns of the newspaper. And then let it be ordered
          simply, that a manuscript copy of the said Journal be filed with the Secretary of State.
          Thus a saving of thousands of dollars, the cost of printing and binding those clumsy
          Journals, would be induced, without adding anything to the expense of clerskhips; a
          readable and authentic journal of our legislation would be secured to the Public Archives
          and the newspapers throughout the country, instead of the awkard, unprofessional,
          unreliable matter which now passes for that; and the volume would then be in the binders
          hands complete and ready for distribution the day after the final adjournment of each and
          every session.

            this day at two o'clock P M , in their Chamber in the Capitol, in the City of
            Indianapolis, under the proclamation of His Excellency the Governor, dated March 22,
            1869.
          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR [Hon Will Cumoack] took the Chair as, ex
              officio President of the Senate, promptly at the hour named in the
            Governor's proclamation convening the Forty sixth General Assembly in extra
            session. Having commanded order, he said:
          "The Secretory of the Senate will please read the proclamation of the Governor
            convening a special session of the Genera Assembly"
          The Secretary then read as follows:
          
            
              
                
                STATE OF INDIANA,  EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT.
                WHEREAS, The General Assembly of the State of Indiana, at its
                  late Regular Session, failed to pass the necessary approbations to carry on the
                  State Government and to meet the current expenses of the Benevolent and other
                  Public Institutions of the State, and by reason thereof, the public welfare
                  imperatively requires that said General Assembly should be convened in Special
                  Session with the least practicable delay;
                THEREFORE, I, CONRAD BAKER, Governor of the State of Indiana, do issue this Proclamation
                  convening the General Assembly of the State in Special Session, and summoning the
                  members thereof to meet in their respective Halls of legislation in the State
                  House at Indianapolis, at two o'clock P. M of THURSDAY, the 8th day of April,
                  A. D , 1869.
                
                  In witness whereof, I have hereunto subscribed my name and caused the seal
                    of the State to be hereunto afixed at Indianapolis, this 22d day of March, A D.,
                    1869.
                  
                    [L S]
                    CONRAD BAKER
                  
                  By the Governor:
                  
                  M F. A HOFFMANN, 
                  Secretary of State. 
              
            
          
          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. At the Adjournment of the regular session, of the 8th of
            March, there were seventeen seats in this body vacant by reason of the resignation of
            the Senators who had held them. The Secretary will please call the roll of Senators who
            did not resign, and are at present members of this body.
          The Secretary called the roll as directed, and the following Senators answered to their
            names
          
            
              
                
                  Mr. Alanson Andrews, from the counties of Scott and Jennings
                  Mr F. G Armstrong, from the counties of Carroll and Howard.
                  Mr J. R. Beardsley, from the county of Elkhart.
                  Mr F J . Bellamy, from the counties of Switzerland and Ripley.
                  Mr. Jas A Bradley, from the counties of Laporte and Starke.
                  Mr. Firman Church, from the counties of Lake and Porter.

                  Mr. John Green, from the counties of Hamilton and Tipton.
                  Mr. John N. Hadley, from the counties of Putnam and Hendricks.
                  Mr. T. M Hamilton, from the counties of Clinton and Boone.
                  Mr Ed Henderson, from the counties of Johnson and Morgan.
                  Mr L. W. Hess, from the counties of Hancock and Henry
                  Mr. A Y. Hooper, from the counties of Koscuisko and Whitley
                  Mr Thomas C. Jaquess, from the counties of Posey and Gibson
                  Mr S F Johnson, from the counties of Spencer and Warrick
                  Mr John Reynolds, from the counties of St. Joseph and Marshall.
                  Mr Milton S Robinson from the counties of Madison and Delaware.
                  Mr. W. J Robinson, from the counties of Decatar and Rush
                  Mr Harvey D Scott, from the county of Vigo.
                  Mr John A. Stein. from the county of Tippecanoe.
                  Mr. Anson Woloott, from the counties of White, Pulaski, Benton, Jasper, and
                    Newton.
                
              
            
          
          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR Twenty-six Senators [25?] Senators answered to their names. The
            Secretary will please call the districts, seats from which were made vacant by the
            resignation of Senators. Persons having certificates of  election will answer as the names of their districts are
            called.
          The Secretary called the following named Senatorial districts:
          
            The county of Vanderburgh
            The counties of Knox and Daviess.
            The counties of Pike, Dubois and Martin.
            The counties of Washington and Harrison.
            The counties of Floyd and Clark.
            The counties of Ohio and Dearborn.
            The county of Franklin.
            The counties of Shelby and Bartholomew.
            The counties of Green and Owen.
            The counties of Clay and Sullivan.
            The county of Montgomery.
            The counties of Cass and Fulton.
            The counties of Grant, Blackford and Jay.
            The counties of Huntington and Wells.
            The county of Allen.
            The counties of Allen and Adams.
          
          No one appearing to claim a seat as Senator from any of these districts.
          Mr. BRADLEY said: Mr. President - There is evidently not a quorum of the Senate
            present, therefore, I move to adjourn till to morrow morning at ten o'clock. I
            forget whether we have any rule in the Constitution designating the hour of meeting
          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR The rule of the Senate is that for the first fifteen days the
            adjournment shall be till two P M , unless otherwise ordered.
          Mr BRADLEY. I will change my motion in that way.
          The motion to adjourn was rejected.
          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR There being but twenty-seven Senators present, there is no
            quorum for the transaction of business, and the only order the Senate can make, as the
            Chair understands the Constitution, is to compel the attendance of absent members. The
            Secretary will now call the list, of absentees.
          The SECRETARY called - 
          
            
              
                
                  Mr. Case, from the counties of Noble and Lagrange.
                  Mr. Caven, from the county of Marion.
                  Mr. Colley, from the county of Marion.
                  Mr. Hughes, from the counties of Monroe and Lawrence.
                  Mr. Kinley, from the county of Wayne.
                  Mr. Rice, from the counties of Parke and Vermillion.
                  Mr. Taggart, from the counties of Brown and Jackson.
                  Mr. Wood, from the counties of Fountain and Warren.
                
              
            
          
          No response being heard from either of these Senators - 
          Mr. HENDERSON said: Mr. President As it is evident, that we can do nothing I renew the
            motion to adjourn till 2 o'clock to-morrow.
          The motion to adjourn was rejected Upon a division - affirmative, 2; Messrs. Bradley
            and Henderson.] Negative not counted. [Laughter.]
          Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President: I offer the following resolution.
          The Secretary commenced to read but was stopped by - 
          Mr. BRADLEY, who said: Mr. President. I rise to a point of order: That no resolution is
            in order until there is an organization of the Senate.
          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR The point of order is well taken, unless the resolution refers
            to perfecting the organization. It will be read for information
          The Secretary then read as follows:
          
            
              
                Resolved, That the Governor be notified that no senator from
                  any district where special elections have been ordered, has appeared to qualify as
                  a member of this body on a call of the districts.
              
            
          
          Mr. BRADLEY I now renew my point of order: That the resolution does not refer to the
            organization of the Senate
          Mr SCOTT It proposes to communicate information to the Governor
          Mr. BRADLEY. We have no right to confer with the Governor until the Senate is
            organized
          Mr SCOTT Mr President, it does took directly to the organization of this body - to
            provide it with a quorum, and for no other purpose. There must be some way under the law
            by which this body can become a legally constituted legislative body. It certainly can
            not be that the constitution and laws of the State are so lame that a few men can
            prevent the entire legislation of this commonwealth. I understand it is our duty and our
            right to notify the Governor of this State that in the districts where he has ordered
            special elections, nobody has appeared to answer, and these districts are without
            representation. The law provides what his duty shall be under such circumstances, and I
            insist that the resolution looks directly to the perfection of the organization of this
            body, and therefore is in order. I understand, besides, that there is nothing before
            this body but what shows that we have a quorum. There has been no call of the House to
            show how many members are present, and for the purposes of legislation under the act of
            1865, which has been adopted and acted upon by one special session of the General
            Assembly of Indiana, this resolution is in order. And it is in order upon the other
            proposition, as I insist; otherwise, Mr President, we might sit here the forty days out
            with no purpose at all. With no prospect of a quorum, I know no way by which the
            Governor of the State can be officially notified that there is no person here to claim a
            seat from any of the districts in which he ordered special elections, unless he receives
            notice from this body. There is no provision of law for his being notified in any other
            way. The law does contemplate it, and if not, the necessities of the case require that
            this body shall notify him.
          Mr. BRADLEY (interposing). Suppose the Governor
            should be notified of it, what would he do?
          Mr. SCOTT. I will answer the gentleman - not designing to be short or discourteous -
            that is his business, and not the business of this body. He has his legitimate functions
            to attend to, and we have ours. I conceive that it is our duty to notify him that, from
            those districts in which he ordered special elections, no one has appeared to claim a
            seat, and I know of no other way in which to do it than by resolution. Whether he will
            order additional elections or sot, or whether he will take some other method to inform
            himself whether there baa been an election, is nor my concern. It is enough for me to
            perform my duty as I understand it, and proceed with the best lights I have under the
            constitution.
          Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President - The Senator says that there is nothing before the Senate
            to show whether there is a quorum present or not. If the Senator is in doubt, as to
            whether there was a call of the Senate, I will state, for his information, that there
            has just been a call, and twenty Seven Senators answered to their names as announced by
            the President. Then it is evident, and a fact apparent to Senators, that there is not a
            quorum present.
          Mr SCOTT. Has there been any call of the Senate ordered?
          Mr. BRADLEY. Yes, sir.
          Mr. SCOTT Who by?
          Mr BRADLEY. By the President.
          Mr. SCOTT. I differ with the Senator He called the members who had not resigned.
          Me BRADLEY. And he called those who had.
          Mr. SCOTT. No, sir. He called the districts in which there had been resignations to see
            whether they intended to present, themselves, and nobody came. So I insist that,
            technically, there has been no call of the Senate.
          Mr BRADLEY To satisfy the Senator I will move a call of the Senate.
          Mr, SCOTT. The gentleman need not move a call of the Senate to satisfy me; I don't
            need any call of the Senate. [Laughter]
          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR The Chair decides that there has been a call of the Senate and
            twenty-seven Senators answered. It takes two thirds to constitute a quorum, and when
            there is less than a quorum only certain things can be done. It is the opinion of the
            chair that this resolution does not contemplate any of those those things that can be
            done by less than a quorum, under the Constitution, and it is therefore out of
            order.
          Mr. BRADLEY. I want to say, frankly, the Senator moves to notify the Governor that
            there is no quorum present, and he does that within fifteen minutes of the time
            appointed for the meeting of the Legislature - 
          Mr. SCOTT (interposing). Will the Senator say to the Senate that any man has been
            re-elected in those districts in which special elections were ordered?
          Mr. BRADLEY. I have no knowledge on the subject. I don't say so I have heard that
            there were some re elected. [Laughter] But my point is this: The Senator makes that
            motion within fifteen minutes after the time appointed for the meeting of the
            Legislature - 
          Mr. SCOTT (interrupting) I rise to a question of order. I desire to ask what is before
            the Senate?
          Mr. BRADLEY. The gentleman's resolution.
          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR The Chair ruled the resolution out of order
          Mr. BRADLEY. I beg pardon, then
          Mr. CRAVENS. I am sorry the Chair ruled the motion out of order so promptly. I want to
            call the attention of the Chair to the evident meaning of that clause of the
            Constitution which limits the power of less than what is called a quorum. Upon what
            division of our proceedings does that limitation operate? Only upon legislative
            business, certainly. As a body of men, we clearly have the power to entertain any
            proposition that is not legislative business. Suppose we sit here five, six, seven,
            eight or ten days, and every day call those districts from which the resigning members
            are supposed to come, and no response is heard from these districts, how could we inform
            the Governor of this fact? He must know it. It is made his duty by law, where vacancies
            occur among members of the General Assembly, to order elections to fill such vacancies.
            How is he to know that vacancies occur? The only way, it seems to me, would be by
            resolution of this body. Although not a Senate, I hold that the constitutional
            limitation is simply upon the power to dispose of legislative business, and every other
            matter under the face of the sun is in order. It may go upon our record, or it may not.
            We are not sitting here with no power to express our sentiments. I admit, as far as
            legislative business is concerned, that our hands are tied. And I do not believe in the
            truth of that interpretation of the constitution which requires that there shall be
            thirty-four members of this Body to constitute a quorum; but I am not going to discuss
            that question. I desire to call the attention of the Chair to this clause: "Two
            thirds of each House" - . What is a "House?" But I am not going into that
            question now. "Two-thirds of each House shall constitute a quorum to do business, bat a number may meet, adjourn from
            day to day, and compel the attendance of absent members" Suppose we had absent
            members and we wanted to compel their attendance, how would we do it? We could not do it
            unless we passed some resolution - 
          Mr. BRADLEY (interrupting). I rise to a point of order. I desire to inquire what the
            Senator is discussing.
          Mr CRAVENS. I am discussing a question that may have some effect upon the gentleman and
            his absconding friends
          Mr BRADLEY. I have no absconding friends
          The LIEUT. GOVERNOR There is no question before the Senate
          Mr, CRAVENS. I have the right to talk if we have no question before us, and I ask the
            consent of the majority of this body to proceed
          MANY SENATORS "Consent." "Consent" "Consent"
          Mr. CRAVENS. I am about done [Laughter] I hope the Chair will retrace his steps.
            Suppose these gentleman come in and quality, and during the afternoon step out; we are
            the Senators elected, and does the Chair say that our hands are tied so that we can do
            nothing? We certainly have power, or else we are nothing, and the Constitution worse
            than nothing. We have no power to compel these men to come in, but suppose the Senator
            from Laporte (Mr Bradley) steps outside of the bar, could not we send for him?
          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. Certainly
          Mr CRAVENS And we would have to do it, by a resolution of this body.
          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR The Constitution provides for that sort of a case.
          Mr. CRAVENS That is what I am talking about. We have the power to pass a resolution;
            but I do not want to find fault with the ruling of the Chair. It struck me at the time
            the resolution was introduced, that it was improper, but I see upon reflection, that if
            the ruling of the Chair is carried out, we are utterly powerless - bound hand and foot -
            at the feet of these men - we don't know who or what they are. Simply because these
            men won't show their credentials, is the State of Indiana to be trampled into the
            dust? If so, we had better give the power back into the hand of the people and let them
            go to work and make a power that will preserve itself. The Constitution gives power to
            do something - what is it? That you shall do no business? It don't say that. It
            says: "Two-thirds of the members of each House shall constitute a quorum to do
            business" I hold, that simply means legislative business. "But a smaller
            number may meet, adjourn from day to day, and" do - what kind of business? All that
            is necessary to "compel the attendance of absent, members" Suppose an election
            is to be held and you have to certify the fact to the Governor that there is not a
            quorum - how will you do that? Will you go and tell him? Will I go? or will we send the
            Secretary? The Secretary is our servant, and we can send him down there, but would the
            Governor be bound to recognize him as an authoritative agent of a body that has no
            existence except in contemplation of law? We have the power to do something - and if
            anything at all - to protect ourselves - defend our existence. If we fail in that, then
            the existence we talk about is not worth fighting for. What do we come here for? To do
            the business of legislation. And, upon the threshhold, we are met with revolution. These
            men say they will not qualify. No; they don't say that. They are not here to say
            anything. We interpret their motive by their conduct. The Governor may not act upon this
            resolution, though we were to pass it. But suppose we meet to morrow, and Saturday, and
            no quorum is present, and we notify him again of the fact And when we have notified time
            and again, he will be judge of what is best to be done for the preservation of the life
            of the Government itself I have no doubt that the Chair has ruled conscientiously in
            this matter. I am not going to take an appeal. But, I say, that conscientious ruling
            places us without the power to do anything. We could entertain a motion to adjourn from
            day to day, of course; but what, does the Constitution mean when it says, that we may
            compel the attendance of absent members? Have you a Sergeant at-Arms? No. Have you the
            power to raise the police force? No. How would you get it? Suppose you wanted to bring
            in a police force to bring in absentees, could you order it? I say, for certain
            purposes, we are a Senate; and as such we have the power to entertain these motions, act
            upon them, and enforce whatever is necessary to preserve the existence of this body. If
            we have not got that power we had better go back to the people and give back to them the
            trust they have reposed in us. I beieve we have the power, and am willing to act.
          Mr. GREEN. It seems to me clearly, under the Constitution, that we have some power or
            other. Now, have we not the power to call upon the Governor to know whether he would
            order an election? We certainly have the power to call upon the Secretary of the State
            to know whether there have been any returns made, who is elected, or whether there has
            been any election at all or not. May we not call upon the Governor to know whether he ordered elections? It seems to me that we have
            the power to pass the resolution which was offered by the Senator from Vigo, (Mr.
            Scott)
          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. The Chair is very clear on this question. The difficulty
            presented by the Senator from Jefferson [Mr. Cravens] grows out of the fact of the
            wording of the Constitution of the State. It says: "Two-thirds of each House shall
            constitute a quorum to do business" Could less than that number constitute a quorum
            for that purpose? Clearly not; but a smaller number may do certain things - meet, from
            day to day and compel the attendance of absent members;" that is what we can do,
            and the only thing we can do.
          Mr. CRAVENS, And under that power to compel the attendance of absent members, is not
            this body at liberty to select the means for the attainment of that object?
          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR Of course; they may do anything or the accomplishment of that
            constitutional end; bur, the resolution offered by the Senator from Vigo [Mr Scott] is
            to notify the Governor that some persons have not appeared and been sworn in as members
            of this body. So I think the resolution is clearly outside of the constitutional
            limitation. If there are difficulties in the way it is not the fault of the Chair. I
            propose to enforce, as I understand it, the constitutional rule, and to abide by the
            constitutional rule, as I understand it; and it appears to me that under the
            constitution there is not one single thing we can do except to compell the attendance of
            absent members, and adjourn from day to day.
          Mr CRAVENS. Would it be competent to take an appeal from the decision of the Chair?
          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. I suppose you might do that.
          Mr. CRAVENS. That is outside of the questions about compelling the attendance of
            members or of adjourning?
          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR The Chair always grants the right of appeal as a matter of
            courtesy
          Mr STEIN. There is nothing, of course, before the Senate. I believe talk is the order
            of the afternoon It does not seem to be the opinion of members to adjourn, and it
            appears to be as good a time as any for an expression from me upon this question. I
            believe the Chair was entirely right in its decision just now made, although I do not
            think the ground upon which the Chair ruled was right. That ground, as I understand it,
            was that there was no quorum present, hence no power to pass a resolution of this kind.
            It would be better, perhaps, to put the ruling upon the ground that the constitution
            limits our power; or that the constitution grants us limited powers. The Senator from
            Jefferson [Mr. Cravens] doubts the constitutional limitation of powers, and insists that
            we have powers outside of the constitution. I doubt that. I think what appears in the
            constitution is the only grant of powers that we have, and that we have no powers
            outside of the constitution, provided we consider ourselves less than a quorum. I
            entertain this view of the constitution. My whole notion in regard to the case is this:
            After the roll of qualified members was called; the districts vacated by the resignation
            of Senators was called, and no response being had, it might be proper for us to adjourn
            to another day, out of courtesy to those elected from these districts, to give them
            another opportunity of presenting themselves to the Senate. The numbers representing
            these districts may possibly be absent on account of sickness; or they may fail to
            arrive in consequence of the interruptions of travel. And it might be proper to give
            them another day. And inasmuch as the Constitution talks about five days to manipulation
            before an organization, I feel disposed to - 
          Mr CHURCH interrupting. From information just received I learn that they have been
            mired in the Black Swamps, [Laughter]
          Mr. STEIN. All the more reason why we should give them another day.
          Mr BRADLEY to Mr. Church: Who gave you that information?
          Mr CHURCH, in reply, was understood to say: I believe the rules of the House do not
            require me to answer [Laughter]
          Mr. STEIN. That is very improbable information at this time. After having exhausted our
            five days, still these districts being called day after day, remaining unrepresented, a
            great question is presented to us: Whether a factious minority shall stop legislation,
            throttle the State Government, and possibly reduce the State to a condition of anarchy;
            or whether there is some virtue in the Constitution, so that we can proceed to business.
            As far as I am concerned, my convictions are firm, though I do not find a superabundance
            of members agreeing with me. Upon every principle of reason and sense in technical
            municipal law that is applicable to public law; upon every principle of reason and legal
            construction, we who remain behind are the constitutional General Assembly of the State
            of Indiana. And we have full authority, from and after the time we see fit to assert it,
            to proceed with the legislation of the State. My own opinion is, that we have the power to consider these rebellious districts as seceded
            districts and that we can consider ourselves as the remains of legislation - legal
            legislation, left living in the State - and proceed with our business. And, were my
            judgment to prevail in this matter, this body would simply adjourn to day; and after
            having done all that can be done - the qualified members having been called, and the
            vacant districts - called and to morrow going through the same ceremony - this process
            to be repeated five days, as a matter of courtesy, not as a matter of right, to these
            districts - and after that the day of grace should be closed, and we should assert
            ourselves the law making power of the State, and proceed to general legislation. The
            correctness of my petition depends upon the construction of the Constitution of the
            State of Indiana, and it is purely a question of construction. The Constitution is not
            specific upon this particular point, and not being specific, recourse must be had to the
            principles of construction and interpretation. It says: "Two thirds of each House
            shall constitute a quorum to do business." Is there anything specific about, that?
            What is meant by "two-thirds?" You must resort to construction and
            interpretation to ascertain the meaning, because it is dubious and uncertain. There is
            ambiguity about it, and you are therefore forced into constructions. And when you come
            to constructions, which will you adopt? That which declares a suicidal principle, or
            that which declares a life giving principle - a preserving principle? In a court of
            justice, this matter would not be permitted to be argued before any respectable judge
            for one minute. Where have we ever heard of a respectable Court permitting the law to be
            so construed as to pronounce its own destruction? This Charter was made to exist, and
            not to be smothered - throttled - disemboweled, or otherwise killed - or die for want of
            breath. The laws are made for perpetuity, until repealed, and no construction will be
            allowed which would authorize the court to decide that the Constitution contains within
            itself a self destroying principle. If, however, you construe the ambiguous passage to
            mean that two-third shall be two thirds of one hundred in the other end of the Capitol
            and two thirds of fifty here, you put the entire government of Indiana in the hands of a
            factious minority the government passes out and thus for want of breath there is no life
            in it. You at once impregnate this Constitution with a self destroying principle. It is
            in the hands of the gentleman and this (pointing to Mr. Bradley and Mr. Henderson) to
            bring anarchy upon us. Now, I say that species of construction is violative of reason;
            and reason is the polar star to which we have recourse in the construction of law.
          In other parts of this Constitution there are different passages. There is a section
            relating to the passage of bills: "A majority of all the members elected to each
            House shall be necessary to pass every bill or joint resolution." How different the
            language in section twenty-five from section eleven. The construction I put upon section
            eleven is this: When it speaks of two thirds it means two thirds of the numbers elected
            and qualified in each House, and that preserves the House. In section twenty five I am
            not at liberty to say that. I have no doubt but that we must have twenty-six Senators
            and fifty one members of the House to pass a bill or joint resolution. We are limited by
            the expression in section twenty-five. We cannot by construction get out of that,
            unjust, as I think it is; but being in the Constitution, I propose to abide by it I
            desire to give life to this Constitution and not to kill it. As far as section
            twenty-five prescribes the number to pass a bill, I accept, it, and am bound by it. As
            regards section eleven I cannot construe it the way these gentlemen desire without
            engrafting a suicidal principle in this Constitution, and that I cannot do, because all
            principles of legal construction forbid it. As I said before, it is a question of
            construction entirely. The language of section eleven being uncertain, I say the only
            way in which you can construe that in order to give life to the Constitution and the
            government and put a veto on every possibility of dissolution through faction, secession
            or rebellion, is to construe that section to mean "two-thirds of the members
            elected and qualified in each House shall constitute a quorum," and when it comes
            to that, let those withholding districts stay away - perhaps it will be better for the
            State - and after exhausting the principles of courtesy and propriety, we will proceed
            as the Constitutional General Assembly of Indiana having a full quorum to do the
            legislative business of the State.
          Mr. GRAY Mr President: I regret as much as any one the condition in which his
            Legislature finds itselt, but I shall resort to no extraordinary means to accomplish
            anything not warranted by the Constitution. Now, I do not know as I clearly understood
            the Senator from Tippecanoe [Mr Stein] He seems to have argued a while upon one side of
            the question, and at the close of his speech upon the other side, I first understood him
            to hold clearly that we had a right to do business, and then that two thirds of the
            qualified members could transact business. NOW, I
            think there can be no doubt about what constitutes the Legislature of Indiana at all. I
            understand the Constitution of Indiana to limit the number of members - "that the
            House shall not exceed 100 members, nor the Senate 50 members."
          Mr. CHURCH interposing. Suppose the counties or districts which have, by the
            appointment, one-third of the number,refuse to select, or refuse to be represented here,
            must the business of the Senate stop there?
          Mr GRAY. Well, sir, I will answer the Senator. I propose to be governed by the organic
            act of the State, and I suppose the Senator from Porter (Mr. Church) proposes to do the
            same. And if he will show me any constitutional remedy by which we can escape that
            difficulty, I will be as ready to follow it as he Now let him point it out There are
            some things we can do, and some things we can not do. Among the latter, we can not
            legally legislate under the Constitution when we have no quorum
          Mr ROBINSON, of Madison. At the commencement of the rebellion, suppose one third of the
            counties in Indiana had seceded with their members, and left this body reduced below a
            quorum, should that overturn the Constitution?
          Mr GRAY If the existence of the State of Indiana depended upon this Legislature doing
            certain business, I would be ready to do it. I believe as Daniel Webster said, that
            anything necessary to preserve the Constitution of the United States is in itself
            constitutional. But I do not think that crisis has arisen yet I do not look upon this as
            being very much of a revolution. I think these refractory members will get tired of that
            business; and then get through; and we can stand it pretty near as long as they can.
          Mr GRAY then referred to the ruling of the Chair on the resolution submitted by the
            Senator from Vigo, asserting his belief that it is entirely correct; which gave rise to
            a conversational debate as to the scope of the resolution, in which Messrs. SCOTT,
            BELLAMY, FISHER and GRAY participated.
          Mr. BRADLEY was sorry that the Senator construed the Constitution as he did, and hoped
            the Senator from Randolph would correct all that, which he did in part These Senators
            may come in to morrow and they may come in the next day. We should not proceed in haste.
            I suppose the Senate would be willing to adjourn till to-morrow, and suggest that
            perhaps there will be a quorum by that time Certainly no good could be accomplished by
            the resolution of the Senator from Scott The Governor cannot declare these seats vacant.
            No power can do that except the Senate when there is a quorum present. The Senator from
            Tippecanoe thinks that less than thirty-four Senators may constitute a quorum. He thinks
            two-thirds of this Senate being present - 
          Mr. STEIN, interposing. I say: Senates elected and qualified, provided there is a
            majority.
          Mr. BRADLEY continuing. Now, suppose there are twenty-five; then two thirds of
            twenty-five would constitute a quorum. Then, if twenty were present, two-thirds of that
            number would still make a quorum; and so on, you might reduce the Senate to three, and
            finally get it down to one man. One section of the Constitution provides that a majority
            of all the members elected shall be requisite to pass a bill or joint resolution; and
            another action says that two-thirds of each house shall constitute a quorum to do
            business Now, what is a house, as far as the Senate is concerned? The Constitution
            provides that the Senate shall consist of not exceeding fifty members. The law says that
            it shall consist of fifty members Then fifty members shall constitute the Senate. And
            when the Constitution says that two-thirds of the Senate shall constitute a quorum, it
            means two-thirds of the Senators. And the Senator can not construe it to mean anything
            else It is perfectly plain. I think there is no necessity for this discussion. I do not
            think we need to sit here any longer to-day. I think it proper for the Senate to adjourn
            till tomorrow; and I have no doubt that there will be a quorum present, from what I
            learn.
          Mr SCOTT. I am willing to do that. I did not see any necessity for waiting till
            to-morrow and next day, and next day. When gentlemen say they will not come, I take them
            at their word. But, if the gentleman is prepared to say that, perhaps, to morrow there
            will be a quorum here, I am willing to adjourn
          Mr. BRADLEY I am not prepared to say positively; but I think, perhaps, there will
            be
          Mr SCOTT. I will take the "perhaps," if the gentleman is at liberty to say
            that. [Laughter]
          Mr CHURCH With that view of the case, supposing that the Senator understands the
            meaning of the word "perhaps"
          Mr. HENDERSON, (interposing). I can explain what "perhaps" means.
          Mr CHURCH I know what it means.
          Mr ROBINSON. Let us have the explanation.
          Mr. CHURCH. I am satisfied that the explanation would not be proper here, and I would rather not hear it. I was going to say that,
            with the explanation of the Senator from Laporte, it is possible there will be a quorum
            to morrow. I will move that the Senate adjourn.
          The motion was agreed to, and then
          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR declared the Senate adjourned till to-morrow at two
            o'clock P M
        

        
          HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
          The members of the House of Representatives of the Forty-sixth General Assembly of the
            State of Indiana, met this day, at two o'clock P. M., in their
            Hall in the Capitol, in extra session, in pursuance of the proclamation of His
            Excellency, the Governor of the State, dated March 22 1869 Mr Speaker Stanton taking the
            Chair.
          The SPEAKER The House will please come to order. And the order of the attention of
            members in their places obtaining, the Speaker announced a call of the House, and
            directed the Clerk to proceed with the roll. Whereupon - 
          The Clerk called the names of such members of the House as did not resign on the 4th of
            March last and before the close of the last regular session, and there were responses,
            immediately and subsequently, as follows:
          
            
              
                PRESENT - Messrs. Admire, Baker, Barnett, Beatty, Britton,
                  Breckinridge, Buskirk, Chapman, Chittenden, Coffroth, Davidson, Davis, Dunn,
                  Fairchild, Field of Lake, Field, of Lagrange, Furnas, Gilham, Gordon, Greene,
                  Hall, Hamilton, Higbee, Higgins, Hutson, Johnson of Parke, Johnson of St. Joseph,
                  Jump, Kercheval, Lamborn, Logan, Mason, Millegan, Miller, Mitchell, Monroe,
                  Osborn, Overmyer, Palmer, Pierce of Porter, Pierce of Vigo, Ratliff, Sabin,
                  Skidmore, Stephenson, Stewart of Ohio, Stewart, of Rush, Tabor, Vardeman, Vater,
                  Wile, Wildman, Williams of Hamilton, Williams of St. Joseph, Wilson and Mr Speaker
                  - 56.
              
            
          
          The SPEAKER The Clerk will now call the counties represented
          Mr COFFROTH suggested that it is customary to call the names of the members elect in
            connection with the counties.
          The SPEAKER. The Clerk has no official information on that subject
          Mr. COFFROTH supposed he has as much information as the Clerk generally has on that
            subject at the opening of any session.
          The SPEAKER now directed, and the Clerk proceeded to call the names of the resigned and
            the re-elected members of the House, as printed in the Roll ot Members of the House of
            Representatives of the late regular session.
          Mr OSBORN suggested, as to the order, to call the names of those whom rumor says are
            elected Representatives of certain Counties, that it would be proper now to call the
            names of the Counties and Districts not represented here to-day, so that if there should
            be any person present having credentials as a Representative from any of these Counties
            or Districts, he may come forward, present them, and the fact, be made a matter of
            record
          Mr COFFROTH stated the ordinary course to be this: When the counties are called, the
            name of the person elected therefrom (of whom the clerk has information) is called with
            it. It had never been the case that the name of the county alone has been called, for
            some other person to step up and claim a seat here.
          Mr. OSBORN corrected the gentleman from Huntington. He did not say that any person
            might step up with credentials, and the clerk swear him in; but simply that credentials
            might, be presented, and the fact recorded. He would have all the counties called
          Mr. COFFROTH said responses could not be reasonably exuected from all the counties.
            There was Mr Cotton elected from Whitley county but last Monday, and there has not been
            time for him to get here. Mr Shoaff, also, elected for the county of Jay, though he is
            here, is sick, and unable to get to his place.
          The SPEAKER In the absence of any official information as to who are elected, the Chair
            thought that there could be no impropriety in calling the names of the counties alone,
            or with the names of their members elect, and if credentials are presented the House can
            pass upon them.
          Mr OSBORN still urged that the Clerk had already called the names of those of whom
            rumor says they are elected, and there was no response. He thought it proper now that
            the Speaker order the call of those counties. For, in every case where there is no
            response, there is a failure on the part of those counties to send a representive here;
            and we ought to have a record of it.
          The SPEAKER directed the Clerk to call the unrepresented counties and the names of
            their representatives elect.
          The Clerk called: "From the county of Posey - M T Carnahan."
          Mr STEWART, of Rush, seconded the view of Mr Osborn, that it would be enough to call
            the name of the county alone; and, of course, as credentials may be presented the House
            will receive them
          The SPEAKER The names of the counties will be called; and if any present have
            credentials as a Representative, let him step onward.
          Mr OSBORN stated again, that his object was to get a record of the unrepresented
            counties - a record of the fact, if any person come from them, or from any one of them, with the credentials of a Representative
          The thirty seven counties and Representative districts, for which the thirty-six
            resigned members were re-elected - and Hon J S Davis, for Floyd county - were then
            called; and there was no response by credentials
          The SPEAKER announced the number of members present to be less than a quorum to do
            business.
          Mr OSBORN then moved that the House now adjourn till to morrow morning at nine
            o'clock; and that the absentees be notified of this adjournment. And accordingly - 
          The House adjourned.
        

        
          IN SENATE.
          
            FRIDAY, April 9, 1869.
          
          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR took the Chair and command order at 2 o'clock P M , pursuant to adjournment, and directed the Assistant Secretary of
            the last Session (Hon. WM A BONHAM) to read the
            journal of yesterday.
          The Secretary's minutes of yesterday's proceedings having been read - 
          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR said: The Secretary will call the roll
          The Secretary proceeded with the roll call and the following named members appeared and
            answered viz:
          
            
              
                Messrs Andrews, Armstrong Beardsley, Bellamy, Bradley, Case, Church, Cravens,
                  Elliott, Fisher, Fosdick, Gray, Green, Hadley, Hamilton, Henderson, Hess, Hooper,
                  Jacquess, Johnson of Spencer, Kinley, Rice, Reynolds, Robinson of Madison,
                  Robinson of Decatur, Scott, Stein, Wolcott and Wood - 29
              
            
          
          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR then desired the secretary to call the Counties and Senatorial
            Districts unrepresented.
          The Secretary called the following named Senatorial districts:

          
            The county of Vanderburgh
            The counties oft Knox and Daviess.
            The counties of Pike, Dubois and Martin
            The counties of Perry, Orange and Crawford
            The counties of Washington and Harrison
            The counties of Floyd and Clark
            The counties of Ohio and Dearborn.
            The county of Franklin.
            The counties of SheIby and Bartholomew.
            The counties of Green and Owen.
            The counties of Clay and Sullivan.
            The county of Montgomery
            The counties of Cass and Fulton.
            The counties of Grant, Blackford and Jay.
            The counties of Huntington and Wells.
            The counry of Allen
            The counties of Allen and Adams.
          

          No one appearing to claim a seat as Senator from any of these districts.
          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR Twenty-nine Senators only have answered to their names
          Mr JOHNSON, of Spencer. Mr. President: I move that we adjourn till to morrow morning at
            10 o'clock.
          Mr. STEIN. Under the rule I believe we adjourn till two o'clock
          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR I believe the Chair made a mistake in the ruling of yesterday
            on this point. Upon reflection I believe we have no rules for our guidance except the
            Constitution. I am rather inclined to think it is competent to adjourn upon motion to
            any hour from day to day I believe it has been the custom of the Senate at each session
            to adopt the rules of the previous session, but inasmuch as we have no rules, we must be
            governed by common parliamentary law.
          Mr. BRADLEY. I move to amend by striking out, "10' and inserting "2
            o'clock to-morrow afternoon."
          The amendment was rejected.
          The motion to adjourn till 10 o'clock was also rejected, upon a division -
            affirmative 13, negative 15.
          Mr. BRADLEY. I move to adjourn till 2 o'clock to morrow afternoon.
          The motion was rejected, upon a division - affirmative 4, negative not counted.
          Mr CHURCH I move to adjourn till Monday at 2 o'clock P M
          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR We can only adjourn from day to day. The motion is set to
            order.
          Mr. STEIN I move to adjourn till 10 1/2 o'clock A M
            to-morrow
          Mr. BRADLEY I move to amend by inserting 12 1/2 o'clock
          The amendment was rejected
          The motion to adjourn till 10 1/2 o'clock was rejected, upon a division -
            affirmative 9, negative not counted
          Mr BRADLEY. I move to adjourn till to-morrow at 3 o'clock P M
          Mr. CRAVENS. Mr President: I hope the Senate will not adjourn. It seems to me that we
            ought to do something, if we do nothing more than to talk about some steps for the
            organization of this body. This thing of meeting from day to day simply to adjourn is
            too much like child's play. We have a remedy - we have two remedies; and when this
            motion is disposed of, I suggest that we go on and make an effort to do something
          Mr. HOOPER, It is upon the strong probability that by adjourning till to morrow we can
            probably organize without any difficulty - it is under that impression I vote for the
            motion to adjourn.
          Mr. ROBINSON, of Madison to amend the motion by inserting 9 o'clock to-morrow
            morning
          The amendment was agreed to.
          The motion as amended was also agreed to upon the vive
              voce vote, and accordingly - 
          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR declared the Senate adjourned till 9 o'clock A. M.
            to-morrow.
        

        

        
          HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
          The House met at 9 o'clock A. M , pursuant to adjournment - Mr.
            Speaker Stanton in the Chair.
          The journal of yesterday having been read - 
          The SPEAKER pro tempore, ordered a call of
            the House to determine a quorum.
          The Clerk again called the names of the qualified members. He then called the several
            counties and Representative districts - the result still discovering no quorum
            present.
          Mr. VATER. Mr. Speaker: As we have no response from the counties and districts where
            the special elections have been held, I offer the following: And he sent up a paper.
          Mr. COFFROTH. Mr Speaker, I object. I object to the reading for information. There
            being no quorum, we can do no legislative business
          The SPEAKER The Chair holds with the gentleman that we can do no legislative business;
            but the paper can be read for information
          The Clerk then read as follows:
          
            
              
                WHEREAS, In accordance with the proclamation of the Governor
                  convening the General Assembly in special session, we have met in the hall of the
                  House of Representatives to transact such business as may properly come before us;
                  and - 
                WHEREAS, The newly elected members are not present with their
                  credentials to be qualified, and thus enable us to transact the business of
                  necessary legislation; and - 
                WHEREAS, We do not know who are such members elected to fill
                  the vacancies caused by the late resignations of Democratic members of this House;
                  therefore - 
                Resolved. That the Secretary of State be and is hereby
                  requested to furnish to this House, without delay, certified copies of the
                  official returns of the several counties, or special elections for members of the
                  General Assembly of the State of Indiana, held March 23, A. D. 1869. Which are
                  filed in his office.
              
            
          
          Mr. GORDON. Mr. Speaker: As we have met and a call of the House has been ordered, and
            no response has been given from a number of the counties of the State in which special
            elections have been held, I hold that there is no organization; and that it would be
            well now for the House to adjourn sine
            die;
          Mr. COFFROTH (in his seat). I second the motion.
          Mr GORDON continuing - that we have no right to proceed with legislative business
            unless a quorum be present. And if none of the members newly elected from the late
            vacant districts respond to their names - if none of them offer their credentials here
            and are willing to be sworn in, we have no right to proceed. Then I hold that we have no
            right to take up this resolution or any business whatever, and that it is our duty to
            adjourn sine die that I there may be another
            election called that men may be elected who will perform their duties as members of the
            General Assembly. I do not offer this as a motion, but submit it as my sentiment.
          Mr. STEWART, of Rush. Mr. Speaker, I rise to a point of order. The point is that the
            motion to adjourn sine die is not in order
          The SPEAKER The gentleman from Spencer [Mr Gordon] did not offer the motion to adjourn
              sine die. He submitted a suggestion.
          Mr. STEWART, of Rush. Then I will speak to the suggestion. We have no power to adjourn
              sine die; but we have the power - and that is all we can do - to
            adjourn from day to day for five days.
          Mr. OSBORN. I rise to a point of order. There is nothing before the House.
          The SPEAKER, The point is well taken.
          Mr. MONROE then moved that the House adjourn till two o'clock P. M.
          Mr VATER I would like for the gentleman from Jefferson to withdraw that motion for a
            few moments.
          Mr MONROE adhered to his motion; and the question thereon was decided in the
            affirmative.
          
            AFTERNOON SESSION.
            The Chair having been resumed by Mr. SPEAKER STANTON, at two o'clock, P M - 
            On motion of Mr. BUSKIRK, a call of the House was ordered and proceeded with,
              discovering, as before, no quorum present, 57 members responding.
            Mr. OSBORN Understanding that there are a number of gentlemen members-elect of this
              Legislature in the city and still hesitating to come forward and qualify, and wishing
              to give them the fullest opportunity to do so, he moved that the House adjourn till
              five o'clock this afternoon.
            Mr VATER desired to amend the motion - to adjourn till to-morrow morning.
            The SPEAKER The motion to amend is not in order.
            Mr. Osborn's motion was agreed to on a division - 32 voting in the affirmative:
              So the Speaker declared the recess till five o'clock.
            The Speaker pro tempore resumed the Chair at five o'clock P
              M
            Mr OSBORN Mr. Speaker, I suppose it would be useless to go through the call of the
              roll again, whilst there is not yet a quorum present I therefore move that the House
              adjourn till nine o'clock to-morrow morning,
            The motion was agreed to, and accordingly the House adjourned.
          
        
        

        

        
          IN SENATE
          
            SATURDAY April 10, 1869.
          
          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR, commanded order at 9:20 A M, and directed the reading of the
            Secretary's journal of yesterday's proceedings.
          The Secretary's minutes having been read,
          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR directed the Secretary to call the roll of Senators and read
            the names of the unrepresented districts.
          The seventeen unrepresented districts having been called, and no response being heard - 
          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR said: Twenty-eight Senators answered to their names.
          Mr. GREEN. Mr. President, I offer the following resolution:
          
            
              
                Resolved, That the Secretary of State be requested to lay
                  before this body, as soon as he can conveniently, a certified statement of the
                  returns for the election of Senators in the districts declared vacant by
                  resignation at the close of the last session of the General Assembly.
              
            
          
          Mr BRADLEY. Mr. President, I rise the point of order. There is no body here to pass a
            resolution.
          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR The point of order is sustained. No resolution can be passed
            and certified to unless there be two-thirds of the Senators present.
          Mr HENDERSON Mr President, I move that we adjourn till Monday, at two o'clock P
            M.
          The motion was rejected.
          Mr GREEN Do I understand that the President holds the resolution to be out of
            order?
          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. Yes, sir.
          Mr. GREEN. Then that question is not debatable, and I can only say as I stated here the
            other day, that we are tied up. While we have less than a quorum present, the
            Constitution provides that we may meet and adjourn from day to day, and compel the
            attendance of absent members. It is clear that we cannot pass any act in our present
            condition. But are we helpless? Is the Constitution itself its own destroyer? Then we
            must remain here and do but one solitary thing. Is it not legitimate that we should
            require into the cause of the delay of legislation in this body? Have we not the power
            to ascertain who are absent, that we may send for them? or to call upon the Secretary of
            State to know who have, prima facia, a right to seats here? I cannot
            for a moment see any objection to doing any thing that will aid us in organizing.
            Certainly we ought to know who the members elected are. And if there has been no
            election we ought to know it. It may be that we have jurisdiction over these men if
            there have been legal elections. As the Constitution provides, their term of office
            commences the day after, it may be that we have the power to send for and compel the
            attendance of these men. And if we have that power, ought we not to know who they are?
            and from what districts they come? I can not see any objection to the resolution, and I
            hope your honor will not rule so as to prevent its discussion.
          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. The Chair is not inclined to limit discussion; but it does
            seem to me that the provision of the Constitution is very clear, that when there is less
            than a quorum the only thing the Senate can do is to adjourn from day to day, and compel
            the attendance of absent members.
          Mr CRAVENS If we have no power to do anything of that sort, under the strict and rigid
            construction of the Constitution, I would like to ask the Chair by what authority do you
            sit in that desk? The Constitution declares that the Lieutenant Governor shall be the
            presiding officer of the Senate, and if we have no Senate - 
          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. The Constitution provides that the Lieutenant Governor shall
            organize the Senate.
          Mr. CRAVENS. I cannot find that clause.
          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR It amounts to the same thing. Until members are sworn in it is
            his duty to take the initiative.
          Mr CRAVENS. I think there is but one clause ot the Constitution bearing upon the point,
            and than is that the Lieutenant Governor shall, by virtue of his office, be President of
            the Senate. He certainly cannot, by virtue of his office, be President of a body that is
            not a Senate, and as such by his rulings interpose obstructions to the organization of
            this body. It is only by virtue of his office as Lieutenant Governor that that officer
            presides over the Senate, and until there is a Senate he has no right in that chair. Nor
            has any body elected President of the Senate at any other time a right, to that seat: I
            have not, having been elected heretofore. These members might call some one to the
            Chair, or they might organize through another officer. It been customary for the
            Secretary of the body to organize the body; and until there is a Senate I hold that the
            Lieutenant Governor can not hold that chair. When there is a Senate he takes it, and
            nobody will object, but put the same rigid construction upon that clause of the
            Constitution that you put upon the other, and we are without a President until this body
            appoints some one to preside. I want to offer a resolution pretty much of the same kind. It explains itself, and I will send it up
            now
          The Secretary read as follows:
          
            
              
                
                  Resolved That the Secretary of State be and he is hereby
                  requested to lay before this body whatever information may be on file in his
                  office in respect to the special election, held on the 23rd day of March, 1869, to
                  supply the vacancies in the General Assembly, occasioned by the resignation of the
                  members thereof, on the 4th day of March, 1869, with a view to taking the
                  necessary steps to compel the attendance of absent members.
              
            
          
          Mr. CRAVENS What I desire is this: I want to confine myself strictly to the
            Constitution.
          Mr. BRADLEY (interrupting), I rise to a question of order
          Mr CRAVENS (continuing) While I hold the floor the Senator can not rise to a point of
            order. When I state the purpose of the resolution he can make his point of order.
          Mr. BRADLEY (interrupting) I insist upon my point of order
          Mr. CRAVENS (continuing) I want to call the attention of the Chair to that clause of
            the constitution under which the Chair has been acting: "Two thirds of each House
            shall constitute a quorum to do business, but a smaller number may meet, adjourn from
            day to day, and compel the attendance of absent members" This resolution expresses
            clearly the object it has in view. We can not move to compel the attendance of absent
            members because we do not know what members are elected. We are tied hand and foot. The
            firs step is to ascertain whether we have members. It is a rule of law that when the law
            requires certain things to be done we must presume that they have been done. We know
            that under the proclamation of the Governor by virtue of law these elections were
            ordered. We presume the elections were held and that members were elected, but we do not
            know the fact I want to know it officially, and have that information sent here by the
            proper officer I want to ascertain whether or not there have been elections held, and if
            there have been there are members elected to this body who are not here; and I want to
            take the steps to compel their attendance. Some say they are not members, although
            elected I say the Constitution upon which we are acting recognizes the men elected as
            members of this body in that clause of the Constitution where it makes the provision
            that Senators and Representatives elect shall be entirely free from civil process during
            the session of the General Assembly and for fifteen days before the commencement
            thereof. That is a constitutional provision which clearly recognizes them as members of
            this body. They say they are not members because they have not qualified I don't
            care whether they have or not to all intents and purposes they are members and the mere
            swearing to support the Constitution of the State and the Constitution of the United
            States, is a mere incident to the fact. If they are members, I want them brought in,
            and, as far as my voice will go, I am for having it done. If necessary to call in the
            entire power of the State, it should be done. As representatives here we stand in the
            attitude of a population of two millions in numbers, being held at bay, and being
            restrained from doing whatever is necessary for the salvation and welfare of the State
            by seventeen men who ought to be in this body. What else do I want to do? If they are
            not members I want to put a legitimate construction on the construction that will
            authorize us as a body to go an on and transact the business of the State. There is no
            use of meeting here day after day and doing nothing. There is no use of being met at the
            threshold of every proposition with the cry: It is out of order. Under what rule? We
            have no body of rules, as the President decided yesterday. And how can anything be out
            of order here unless it conflicts with the constitution? We are not proposing to do any
            legislative business until we determine these preliminary questions. If there are
            members absent, then our duty is clear under the constitution that we shall compel an
            attendance in this body.
          Mr HOOPER Mr President, I apprehend that, perhaps, the first question we ought to
            decide this morning is whether we will now, in open Senate, determine upon a policy we
            will pursue, or whether we had better adjourn and consult in a different manner upon
            this question. However, as it seems to be in order to present views on the question, I
            will submit a suggestion or two, as to what I consider to be our situation at this time.
            Now, I think the Lieutenant Governor is legitimately in that Chair. There is no question
            about that in my mind; and I will not stop to discuss it.
          Mr. CRAVENS interposing I only raised that point on the ruling of the Chair, that this
            is not a Senate. And, of course, if that is true, the Lieutenant Governor could not be
            our presiding officer. Some years ago that question was raised, whether or not the
            Lieutenant Governor has the power to preside over a body that was not a Senate, which
            created quite a difficulty at that time, and was decided against
          Mr HOOPER, continuing: We must always remember, in considering this question, that for
            the purpose of organizing a legislative body, we inherently possess certain powers and
            rights, that can not be taken from us. It has always
            been usage to do a certain class of business that is necessary, in order to complete the
            organization. It is not necessary, in order to employ the organization of a legislative
            body, that there shall, in the first instance, be present, what is recognized by the
            Constitution as a quorum; for, I repeat, you will find that, it has been the uniform
            practice to do a certain class of business absolutely essential to an organization. And
            I believe there are such acts which we can do.
          As I said before, I apprehend the simple question is whether we shall adjourn and
            consider this matter in another way or discuss and determine it now, for I believe the
            time is come when we ought to act. I believe we have waited long enough on these men,
            who are revolutionary in their attempts. I undertake to say, and I believe the
            authorities sustain me in the assertion that in sixteen or seventeen Senatorial
            districts there are to day vacancies. They have created vacancies by refusing to come in
            and qualify. That, I undertake to say is one way by which vacancies can be brought
            about. If the Senate will bear with me a moment I will refer to a work regarded by all
            of us, I suppose, as good authority. It is, Cushing. Here is what he says:
            "Vacancies may occur in a legislative body in consequence of death, removal,
            refusal to qualify, resignation, expulsion, or disqualification of members, or of their
            return or election being vacated by the assembly" That, in my judgment, is the
            precise situation of this General Assembly today, both in the Senate and the House. From
            each one of these districts refusing to qualify, there are vacancies existing, and our
            duty is plain, simple, and direct. Where vacancies occur during a session of the General
            Assembly, it is the duty of the presiding officer of each house to certify that fact to
            the Governor, and that is the end of our duty. Then a duty devolves upon the Governor,
            and that, I apprehend, is to issue writs of elections. Whether vacancies exist or not,
            is a matter competent for this House, or the other House, to determine for itself. That
            is the only principle acted upon since the organization of Parliament
          In England, the House of Commons has always regarded the right of determining upon the
            existence of vacancies among its members and of taking measures to fill them, as
            essential to its free and independent existence; and has consequently asserted and
            maintained it, as a most important and undoubted privilege, resting upon the same
            foundation with the right of determining upon the election and return of its members. -
              Lex Parliamentaria Americana p 185
          That is one of the rights which inherently exists in legislative bodies: as well to
            determine upon existing vacancies, as to provide for filling vacancies. That is as much
            the law of the State as if enacted in our own statutes. The plain wording of the
            Constitution itself simply affirms this right; for it gives to us the power necessary
            for a free and independent legislative body. It is our duty, plain and direct, simply to
            certify the fact of existing vacancies to the Governor
          I hope the Senate will indulge me a little further in these references.
          In this country, writs of election to fill vacancies are either issued directly by the
            Assemblies themselves, or, on their authority, by the Governor. But there are various
            constitutional and statutory provisions, relating to filling vacancies, which in some
            States, supercede - in others, extend - and, in others again, are su[?]uidiary to - the
            principle which has just been stated, namely, that it is the right of a legislative
            assemby to determine upon the existence of v cancus among its members, and to take
            measures to fill them - Lex Parl Americana pp 187, 188
          That is the principle recognized all the way through. Now, our statute provides, that
            when a vacancy occurs during the session, it is the duty of the residing officer to
            certify that fact to the Governor. What has been the practice in the House of Congress?
            Simply, when the fact becomes notorious, is generally understood, the Speaker has been
            in the habit of issuing writs of election. Suppose a member has deceased, how does the
            Chair determine that fact? He sees that the seat is vacant. It is notorious that such is
            the fact; and it, would be his duty simply to certify that fact to the Governor; and
            then the duty of the Governor is plain. How is it now? Here is evidence before us that
            these seats are vacant. It is notorious - as notorious as could be that of the decease
            of any member. And it is notorious as to why these seats are vacant. Simply because
            members have refused to come in and qualify. We have waited a sufficient length of time.
            We know it is for in consequence of sickness or delay in travel; but it is simply
            notorious that their seats are vacant because they have refused to come in and qualify,
            therefore it is the duty of the presiding officer of either House to certify this fact
            to the Governor. It can not be said that we can not, consider the question because we
            have not two-thirds of all the members here, because this is a right inherent in this
            body in order to perfect its organization; and it is the duty of the presiding officer,
            in my judgment to certify this fact, up. And now, the only remaining question, in my
            judgment, is whether we should determine upon that e of action now, or whether we should
            adjourn and consult with the members in the other end of the capitol. I will not make a
            motion to adjourn, because other Senators may desire to express their views upon this
            question; and it would hardly be proper after
            indulging in such extended remarks myself.
          Mr. BRADLEY Mr President, I do not, intend to discuss this question at the time, but I
            desire to correct some positions taken by the Senator from Whitley [Mr Hooper]. He
            stated from Cushing's Manual the causes or modes by which vacancies occur more
            specific than I can state them. There are but four ways in which a vacancy occurs;
            first, by expiration of the term of office; second, by the death of the incumbent;
            third, by resignation of the incumbent; and fourth, by forfeiture. But a forfeiture must
            be declared by a court of justice or the legislative branch to which he belongs. He may
            forfeit his office by non usage, by misconduct, by removal from the State or District,
            but before that vacancy exists that vacancy must be declared by competent authority.
            Then let us go to the Constitution to find that authority.
          But the Senator says certain powers are inherent in the Senate. I deny it. I insist
            that the Senate has no inherent power. The power is inherent in the people and not in
            the Senate or House of Representatives. The Constitution is not a grant of power, as
            contended by my friend the Senator from Tippecanoe. It is simply a distribution of
            powers and a limitation upon their exercise. The Government is divided into three
            departments - the executive, the legislative and the judicial. The legislative
            department has legislative power and the mode of administering or exercising that is
            limited to the Constitution; it shall do no business except legislative, and the
            Constitution expressly says it shall do no business unless there is a quorum present
            with the single exception that it may adjourn from day to day and send for absentees.
            Now what do they propose to send for? Absent members? No sir. They propose to send to
            the Secretary of State. On Thursday - the first day of the session - they proposed to
            send to the Governor. Now I insist until we become a Senate, and until the other branch
            becomes a House, we have no right nor no power to communicate with the Governor,
            Secretary of State or anybody else. We can not make members; we can not make vacancies.
            We must accept the situation. Senators talk about revolution. The plan of proceeding
            which they propose to adopt is revolutionary and nothing else. They wish to depart from
            the provisions of the Constitution, break down its safeguards and act as a mob and not
            as a legislative body of Indiana. I protest against that.
          Mr. ROBINSON, of Madison, I desire to ask the Senator a question. Are there any absent
            members?
          Mr. BRADLEY. There is one.
          Mr. ROBINSON, of Madison. Who is it?
          Mr. BRADLEY. Mr Huthes
          Mr. ROBINSON of Madison. And Mr. Taggart and Mr. Colley.
          Mr. BRADLEY. I presume so. You can send for them.
          Mr ROBINSON, of Madison, Are there any others?
          Mr BRADLEY. I do not know whether there are or not.
          Mr. ROBINSON, of Madison. Then the members are all present.
          Mr. BRADLEY. It was not my purpose to enter into a discussion of these things because
            it will result in no good. Now I am not disposed to stir up strife, I wish to allay it
            as far as it is in my power. I had hoped that there would have been a quorum here before
            this and I still hope that there will be; and I almost promise that, if there is nor a
            quorum present on Monday I will make no further steps in regard to this matter.
          Mr. BELLAMY, interposing. I will ask the Senator if "almost," with him, is
            stronger than "perhaps?"
          Mr. BRADLEY I do not wish to answer discourteously. There is a time when forbearance
            ceases to be a virtue; and, if we can not organize next Monday, I will vacate my seat
            and return to my constituents the trust they have reposed in me, and let the Legislature
            work out its own salvation.
          Mr CHURCH. The question by the Senator over yonder (Mr Robinson of Madison) is one in
            point: Are there any absent members? If there are not, what do we meet here day after
            day for? What is the use of it? If there are absent, members, let us send for them. A
            member states here, that he does not know whether there are absent members or not. Shall
            we sit here forty days and not know, and not send to the Secretary of State for
            information?
          Mr. BRADLEY interposed: Does the Secretary of State know any better than we?
          Mr. CHURCH. I take it for granted, that we have the right to send anywhere. I care not
            where the information may come from, It is our business to be diligent, and use every
            effort to know whether or not there are members present. We act foolishly to come here
            day after day, when we do not know whether there are absent members or not. The Senator
            from Laporte meets his friends in caucus, I presume, for the purpose of determining
            whether they shall take their seats or not, And, by the daily papers, I take it, there
            is 25 against to 23 for coming in. And yet, we are to meet here day after day, not
            knowing whether there are any absent members or not. Shall we take any steps to find out whether there are any or not? No; that is
            unconstitutional. The Senator says we meet here for the purpose of breaking down the
            Constitution! That is a pretty sentiment to come from a class of men hanging outside of
            these Halls with credentials as Senators in their pockets
          Mr BRADLEY, (interrupting) That remark did not come from outside this Chamber.
          Mr. CHURCH. I say it comes from one who knows that there are men hanging round with
            credentials in their pockets - men of his own party refusing to come in. He say as we
            propose to break down the Constitution. Do we? The Constitution is in the way of an
            organization then? He says we propose to act as a mob. And this coming from a class of
            men who scatter in every direction the moment the gavel is sounded from that desk. I
            say, the question is the one I started out with: Are there any absent members? If we
            have no power to inquire, we have less power than I ever presumed. If there are absent
            members, we have the power to send for them. And that is all there is in it, as I can
            see.
          Mr. SCOTT. One of the difficulties in this matter is, that we have no precedence upon
            the subject. The General Assembly has never been left with such a question before it. We
            have been in the habit of construing these things one way, because there has been no
            particular reason for a different construction. I wish to call the attention of the
            Chair to the 25th section of the Constitution of Indiana. And I insist, under the
            authority of that section, that the resolution offered this morning is in order. "A
            majority of all the members elected to each House shall be necessary to pass every bill
            or joint resolution" This is not a joint resolution. It is simply a resolution of
            this body. There is another section of this Constitution which I wish to call the
            attention of the Chair to. It is the sixteenth section: "Each House shall have all
            powers necessary for a branch of the legislative department of a free and independent
            State" Now, sir, we have been in the habit of construing that as authority after
            the House is organized - after there was a quorum present, according to our construction
            of the Constitution, heretofore. I do not understand by that construction, that any harm
            can be done to the State; but, I do understand, and firmly believe that, that clause of
            the Constitution gives to us that are elected and qualified, the power to preserve the
            life of this State and the legislative power of the State. And when the gentleman
            insists that all the powers of this Government are inherent in the people, I agree with
            him upon that point, and I do insist that we are here representing that people - seeking
            their rights here, and attempting to preserve the legislative power of the State, and
            preventing a minority from destroying it. Now, sir, if I am correct upon that subject,
            that a resolution of this body is in order which is not a joint resolution, and may be
            passed by this body, when it is not required to be passed by the other branch in this
            Capital, and that this House has the necessary power, as a branch of the legislative
            department, to preserve its own life, then I understand that the resolution is in order,
            for the reason that it proposes to perfect the organization of this House. How does it
            propose to perfect it? Simply, to ascertain from the Secretary of State the only
            legitimate mode pointed out by the Constitution where it can be known what persons have
            been elected. Where else can we be informed whether the writs of election have been
            respected by the people? We may know it as individuals. We may feel it in our bones to
            be true. But we do not know it as Senators upon this floor. And I know of no other way,
            except by sending to the State Department to ascertain whether returns have been made
            there. Now, sir, that is legitimate to the purpose for which we are acting. It is a
            matter looking to our own life and preservation. Suppose we send there, and find that no
            returns have been placed upon the files - that there are no persons elected - what is
            the duty of this body? To fill these vacancies in the legitimate mode pointed out by the
            Constitution. Then writs of election must be reissued. But, if there have been
            elections, and these men have been elected, it is for us to take such action as may be
            warranted, either to declare their seats vacant or send for them I believe we have the
            power to do either; and I don't care which we do. When we have official information
            before us, I am willing to act. I am determined, as a Senator, that the life of the
            State shall not be destroyed by this faction. I am willing to call in the power of the
            State to compel the attendance of these men, or obtain official information that they
            will return the trusts reposed in them by the people.
          Mr. KINLEY. The only strange thing to me is, that we hesitate a moment in our course.
            We are either a Senate or not a Senate. It is true the constitution provides that the
            Senate shall not exceed fifty members, and our law provides that the State shall be
            divided into fifty Senatorial districts, and it also provides that the State shall be
            divided into one hundred districts for representation purposes. It says, in effect, that
            there shall be one hundred members in the House of Representatives. If that is to be
            construed literally, then ninety-nine members would
            not be a House. A single member resigning would destroy the House, if the law is to be
            considered literally. The constitution provides that a majority of the members elected
            can enact a law or pass a joint resolution. If these gentlemen who stand outside of the
            bar are not members, then they are no members elected, and the thirty or so members that
            are here are the Senate, and we can transact any business we choose.
          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. If the Senator will allow me. The constitution also provide
            that it shall take two thirds of each House to constitute a quorum to do business; and
            with less than that number only certain acts can be done. On that ground the Chair has
            based its decision.
          Mr. KINLEY. But what is a Senate? The members elected here - the thirty, or so - and we
            are therefore able to transact business. It is true that we have no official notice of
            the fact that these gentleman standing outside of the bar are members elect. But it is
            notorious that they have been elected and are refusing to qualify; and that is precisely
            one of the modes by which a seat can be made vacant. If you, a Lieutenant Governor, had
            come up here and refused to qualify, that act would vacate your seat, and authorize this
            Senate to appoint a Lieutenant Governor in your place. If the Governor had refused to
            qualify, it would have virtually vacated his office. And if a County Treasurer refused
            to qualify it would vacate his office. And so the offices of every one of these
            gentlemen were virtually vacated. And it is certainly within the power of the Senate not
            to send for them, as they have already ceased to be members, or rather, never have been
            members. There are so many vacancies; and it should be so construed.
          Mr. CRAVENS Would it be competent for this body to declare their seats vacant, when we
            have no official knowledge of the fact that there have been elections? The resolution
            before the Senate proposes to fortify us in that particular - to bring out the
            information.
          Mr KINLEY I believe it is a principle of law, that the statute may be plead in
            evidence. It is law.
          Mr. CRAVENS. Suppose, without information, we should send for these men, and find the
            men whom we supposed elected, were not members; what would our condition then be?
          Mr KINLEY. Our condition would be simply that of arresting the wrong men.
          Mr. BRADLEY I would ask the Senator if we have the power to send for any person until
            be becomes a member?
          Mr. KINLEY. That is precisely the point I make; that they are not members. The very
            fact that they stay around this hall and refuse to qualify, in my opinion makes them
            cease to be members.
          Mr. CHURCH. I desire to ask the Senator from Laporte, whether these persons have been
            privileged from arrest for a certain number of days by reason of their having been
            elected?
          Mr BRADLEY That is a hard question. I do not know that any of them have been
            arrested.
          Mr CHURCH Presuming that they have, what would the Senator say?
          Mr BRADLEY. I do not know anything about it.
          Mr. CHURCH. Then they are enjoying privileges by reason of their election, and refusing
            to perform the duties they owe to the State.
          Mr KINLEY. There is certainly a time when they cease to be members.
          Mr. BRADLEY They will cease to be members whenever we get a sufficient number of
            members to do business and declare their seats vacant.
          Mr. KINLEY. Haw many members are sufficient?
          Mr. BRADLEY. Thirty four.
          Mr. KINLEY. How do you make that out?
          Mr. BRADLEY. By the Constitution of the State.
          Mr. KINLEY What article?
          Mr. BRADLEY Section eleven of article four.
          Mr KINLEY I assure you, Mr. President, there is not one word in the Constitution about
            it [Laughter.] The Constitution says the Senate shall not exceed fifty members.
          After further debate, in which Messrs. Gray, Stein, Hooper, Rice, Robinson, of Madison,
            Fisher, Church, Bradley, and Cravens took part, the resolution submitted by Mr. Cravens
            was adopted - yeas 28,nays 2
          And then - 
          On motion of Mr CRAVENS, the Senate took a recess till 2 1/2 o'clock.
          
            AFTERNOON SESSION.
            The Lt. Governor resumed and ordered the roll called and a call of the unrepresented
              districts. Twenty-four Senators answered
            Mr WOLCOTT As the Senate has now no business before it, I move we adjourn till Monday
              2 o'clock.
            Mr. CRAVENS I would like to know before we adjourn whether there has been any
              response from the Secretary of State.
            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. The Secretary informs me that the resolution has been sent;
              but no response has been made.
            And then the Senate adjourned.
          
        

        

        
          HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
          The SPEAKER pro tempore called the House to order at 9 o'clock A
            M, and directed the Clerk to call the roll of the qualified members, and the list of
            Counties and Districts not represented.
          Mr. GORDON moved that the House do now adjourn till Monday at 2 o'clock.
          Mr. OSBORN thought it better not to adjourn now but send for the absentees - get in all
            the Republican members - wait till the Senate convenes and see what they will do.
          Mr UNDERWOOD made the point, which was sustained, that the motion was not
            debatable.
          The House refuged to adjourn.
          Mr OSBORN moved that the Doorkeeper be directed to notify the absentees that the House
            is in session, and request their attendance.
          Mr. VATER submitted an amendment to the motion, which was read, as follows:
          
            
              
                Resolved, That the Doorkeeper, with such assistance as may be
                  necessary, is hereby instructed to bring within the bar of this House, with all
                  possible dispatch, the absent members.
              
            
          
          Mr MONROE made the point, which was sustained, that the motion is not amendable.
          Mr GORDON suggested that we do not yet know who are absent, and if the motion was to
            produce the attendance of members who have not qualified, he held that it is not in
            order
          Mr OSBORN said all the qualified members are not, in their places.
          The SPEAKER then directed the Clerk to call the absentees, and the Doorkeeper to bring
            them in - the motion to send for them having been adopted.
          On motion of Mr. RATLIFF, further proceedings, under the call of the House, dispensed
            with
          After sundry ineffectual motions to adjourn, submitted by Messrs GORDON, WILDMAN,
            VATER, DAVIDSON and others - Mr. Ratliff of Grant, was called to the Chair.
          Mr. STEWART, of Ohio, made an ineffectual motion to adjourn till Monday at three
            o'clock.
          Mr. WILDMAN moved that the Chair may be requested to give his views of the propriety of
            repealing the County Seat bill. [Laughter]
          Mr. BUSKIRK moved that a committee of five be appointed, and instructed to prepare and
            report a resolution adopting the constitutional amendment.
          Mr GORDON proposed that three members of said committee be composed of colored men.
          The SPEAKER pro tem. ruled the motion and out of order.
          Mr. BUSKIRK appealed (informally)
          Mr. COFFROTH moved for the consideration of the salary bill.
          Mr OSBORN moved to take up from the table Mr. Pierce of Vigo's bill, which relates
            to female dogs.
          Mr PIERCE of Vigo. That bill was not laid on the table. And that, I understand, is the
            chief reason why the Democracy are not in their seats in this House. [Laughter]
          After further proceedings in this vein - 
          Mr COFFROTH moved that the House do now adjourn till Monday afternoon, at half past two
            o'clock; and, thereupon, he demanded the yeas and nays.
          The rules requiring one tenth of the numbers present to second the demand for the yeas
            and nays on a motion to adjourn, required now another call of the roll, which determined
            62 members present. And then - 
          Mr COFFROTH withdrew the motion.
          Mr PIERCE of Porter, moved that the House proceed to the election of officers, and he
            said, I make the motion in good faith.
          Mr VATER If the gentleman makes the motion in good faith, I make the point, that we can
            do no business without, a quorum
          The SPEAKER pro tem. sustained the point, and rule the motion out of order
          Mr. PIERCE appealed, and after desultory conversation thereon - 
          Mr. MONROE, declaring the constitutional limitations of the power of the House to be
            this, to send for absentees, and to adjourn from day to day, moved an adjournment till
            Monday, two o'clock P. M
          The motion was agreed to on a division affirmative 28, negative 20.
          So the House adjourned.
        

        
          IN SENATE.
          
            MONDAY, April 12, 1869.
          
          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR took the chair at 2 o'clock P. M., pursuant to
            adjournment, and directed the reading of the journal of Saturday.
          The Secretary's minutes having been read, the Senate roll and a list of the
            unrepresented Senatorial Districts were called, by direction of the Lieutenant Governor.
            When the Secretary reached the Districts of Grant, Blackford and Jay - 
          Mr. HENDERSON said: Mr President: the Senators from these counties are ready to be
            sworn in. The Senator from Jay is present and ready to come forward and take the
            oath.
          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. Senators can come forward
            as their Districts are called
          The list being completed, and no other Senator appearing - 
          Mr. HUEY was sworn in by the Lieutenant Governor.
          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. The Chair will lay before the Senate a communication from the
            Secretary of State, in response to a resolution adopted on Saturday last.
          The communication having been read - 
          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR said: Including the Senator just sworn in, we have 27 Senators
            present.
          Mr. HOOPER. As it is manifest that we have no quorum present, I desire to submit the
            following resolution:
          
            
              
                WHEREAS, At the late regular session of the Forty-sixth
                  General Assembly of the State of Indiana, seventeen Senators resigned their seats
                  in this body and left it without a constitutional quorum to do business, thereby
                  causing a vacancy in the Senate from the following Senatorial Districts, to
                  wit:
                
                  The county of Vanderburgh.
                  The counties of Knox and Daviess.
                  The counties of Pike, Dubois and Martin.
                  The counties of Perry, Orange and Crawford.
                  The counties of Washington and Harrison.
                  The counties of Floyd and Clark.
                  The counties of Ohio and Dearborn.
                  The county of Franklin.
                  The counties of Shelby and Bartholomew.
                  The counties of Green and Owen.
                  The counties of Clay and Sullivan.
                  The county of Montgomery.
                  The counties of Cass and Fulton.
                  The counties of Huntington and Wells.
                  The county of Allen.
                
                AND, WHEREAS, The Governor did issue writs
                  of election to the several counties of said Districts, and caused special
                  elections to be held therein on the 23d day of March, 1869, to fill said
                  vacancies;
                AND, WHEREAS, Afterwards, to-wit, on the
                  22d day of March, in the year aforesaid, the Governor issued his proclamation
                  summoning the members of the General Assembly to meet in special session in their
                  respective Halls in the State House, at Indianapolis, at two o'clock P M, of
                  Thursday, the 8th day of April, A. D. 1860, which proclamation reads as follows,
                  to wit:
                
                  
                    
                      
                      STATE OF INDIANA,
                        EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT.
                      
                      WHEREAS, The General Assembly of the State of Indiana,
                        at its late regular session, failed to pass the necessary appropriations to
                        carry on the State government and to meet the current expenses of the
                        benevolent and other public instructions of the state, and by reason thereof
                        the public welfare imperatively requires that said General Assembly should
                        be convened in special session with the least practicable delay.
                      Therefore, I, Conrad Baker, Governor of the State of Indiana, do issue this
                        proclamation convening the General Assembly of the State in special session,
                        and summoning the members thereof to meet in their respective Halls of
                        legislation in the State House at Indianapolis, at two o'clock P. M.,

                      In witness whereof, I have hereunto subscribed my name and caused the seal
                        of the State to be hereunto affixed at Indianapolis, this 22d day of March,
                        A.D., 1869.
                      
                        [L S]
                        CONRAD BAKER.
                        
                        By the Governor.
                        
                        M. F. A. HOFFMANN, Secretary of
                          State.
                      
                    
                  
                

                AND, WHEREAS, On the 8th day of April,
                  1869, in obedience to said proclamation, a majority of all the members of said
                  General Assembly did meet in their respective Halls at 2 o'clock P M , of
                  said day, and in the Senate, the Lieutenant Governor in the Chair, directed the
                  Secretary of the last regular session, O M Wilson, to call the names of the
                  Senators who had not resigned, and, upon said call, twenty six Senators answered
                  to their names. Th Secretary then, by direction of the Lieutenant Governor called
                  the several Districts, heretofore named, wherein vacancies had occurred by
                  resignation, and no one answered, or presented credentials of election, from said
                  Districts. The Senate then adjourned until the next day at two o'clock p. M.,
                  and in pursuance of said adjournment, again met at two o'clock P M of Friday,
                  April 9, 1 69 when the same proceedings were had as to call of members and
                  districts, as on the day previous, and with like result, except that twenty nine
                  members answered to their names.
                After which call, on motion, the Senate adjourned until the next day at nine
                  o'clock A M, of Saturday, April 10th, 1869 when the same proceedings as those
                  of the first day were again had as to calling of members and districts, and with
                  like result, except that twenty-eight members were present, when, on motion, the
                  Senate adjourned until two o'clock P M of said day; and in accordance with
                  said adjournment again met in session at two o'clock, when the same
                  proceedings as to calling of members and districts were again had with the same
                  result, after which on motion, the Senate adjourned until the next day at two
                  o'clock P M : and in pursuance of said adjournment, again met in session at
                  two o'clock P M on Monday, April 12th, 1869, when the members and districts
                  were again called, and still no one answered or presented credentials from said
                  districts heretofore named wherein vacancies had occurred And
                WHEREAS, The Secretary of State, at the request of this body
                  has laid before us certified copies of the official returns of the several
                  counties of the special election held therein for members to fill the vacancies in
                  said districts, and it appears therefrom that the following persons were duly
                  elected at said special elections, to fill said vacancies, to wit:
                For the county of Vande burgh - Daniel Morgan.
                For the counties of Knox and Daviess - W. S, Turner.
                For the counties of Pike, Dubois and Martin - - Montgomery.
                For the counties of Perry, Orange and Crawford - W. F Sherrod
                For the counties of Washington and Harrison - George Donbo.
                For the counties of Floyd and Clark - George V Howk.
                For the counties of Ohio and Dearborn - Elijah J. Hoffman
                For the county of Franklin - Thomas Gifford.
                For the counties of Shelby and Bartholomew - Thomas G. Lee.
                For the counties of Green and Owen - John Humphries
                For the counties of Clay and Sullivan - James M. Hanna.
                For the county of Montgomery - Archibald Johnson.
                For the counties of Cass aad Fulton - Charles B Lasselle.
                For the counties of Huntington and Wells - Wilson Smith.
                For the county of Allen - Wm. W. Carson; and -
                WHEREAS, It is notorious to this body that during the five
                  days in which the foregoing enumerated proceedings were had, and said various
                  calls of members and districts made, said members elect werein the city of
                  Indianapolis, in and about the State House, many of them within the hearing of
                  said calls, and allhad knowledge thereof, yet
                  during all said time they purposely and willingly neglected and refused to present
                  their credentials and take the oath required of them by law to enable them to take
                  their seats, thereby vacating the same and leaving the Senate without a quorum and
                  unable to fully organize until said vacancies are filled; and
                WHEREAS, The public welfare imperatively requires that the
                  General Assembly should be fully organized with the least practicable delay and as
                  such organization cannot be made until said vacancies are filled, therefore, in
                  order to complete the organization of this Senate,
                Resolved. That by purposely and willingly refusing to qualify
                  and take their seats, said members elect have vacated the same and the President
                  of the Senate is directed to notify the Governor that a vacancy has happened at
                  the present session in the office of State Senator from each of the Senatorial
                  Districts in the preamble hereto recited, by the said members elect refusing to
                  qualify and take their seats.

              
            
          
          Mr BRADLEY. I rise to a point of order, or I will say this: I would prefer that the
            resolution would be withdrawn for the present. I have an idea - which is very strong -
            that we will get along with the organization in a very short time; but if that is thrust
            in, the organization will be further delayed. I hope the Senator wil not press the
            resolution.
          Mr FISHER (in his seat) How long shall we wait? Forty days and forty nights?
          Mr FISHER (continuing) No sir, not forty days and forty nights. The point of order is
            that we can't, pass a resolution. The preamble is not - I shant say it is not true,
            but we have no right to declare a thing that we don't know whether it is true or
            not. We don't know that the men elected ever received notice of the proclamation.
            The Secretary of State, I see, returns that certain persons have been elected. Now we
            can officially take notice that the Secretary of State don't know who is elected.
            He can't know. He has no right to know. He can only receive notice of who received
            so many votes. He can't certify who is elected. Hence I say I would be glad if the
            Senator would not press that resolution. If he does, I think I can assure him that the
            organization will further be delayed.
          Mr STEIN I would suggest to the Senator from Whitley, [Mr. Hooper] that the preamble
            requires some amendment. [He suggested the amendments - which are embodied in the
            resolution as printed above - with regard to the number of members responding to roll
            call at different times] For the honor of the Republican branch of the Senate it would
            be well to have the preamble set forth the facts as the Journal shows the facts to
            be.
          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR This is a question not free from difficulty by any means. It
            seems to me - and I have thought considerably about this question, for I apprehended
            that it would arise - that after the Senate has exhausted its constitutional power in
            enforcing its constitutional right to compel the attendance of absent members, and
            arrives at the point where there are no absent members sufficient to make a quorum, then
            it would be in the power of the Senate to pass a resolution to take the next step to
            provide at some time for the organization of the body. And I do not know what the Senate
            could do, when it compels the attendance of all the members qualified and yet has no
            quo-runs, except to inform the Governor of the fact that they could not get members
            enough. There are vacant seats; they have forced the attendance of all qualified members
            and yet there is no quorum. It seems to me the next and only thing is to notify the
            Governor of that fact because it is not to be supposed that the Constitution requires
            the absurdity that we should stay here forty days without a quorum. Therefore, I think
            that the resolution is in order.
          Mr. HOOPER. At the suggestion of the Senator from Tippecanoe, I will have the Secretary
            insert the proper number of members answering from day to day, as shown upon the
            journals of the Senate. And consider that as corrected now.
          Mr. STEIN. It requires some further correction. I presume the Senator had better
            withdraw it and have it amended, as we propose to put this paper through. Inasmuch as it
            goes upon the record, and before the public, as an indication of our action, it would be
            well to have it correct.
          Mr. HOOPER I will do so. I will withdraw it for the present.
          Mr. WOLCOTT Mr President - Believing that the Legislature is now a duly constituted
            legislative body, in the absence of the members that have refused to qualify, I would
            like, if it is proper, to make a motion that we proceed to business. And I desire to
            discuss that question. The object of the people of the State of Indiana in establishing
            a State Government was, paramountly, the formation and maintainance of a State
            Government. All questions of details are subordinate and are to be construed with
            reference to the great paramount purpose - the establishment and maintainaace of
            Government. Then the Constitution and Laws of the State, by fair meaning and proper
            construction, can not but maintain the proposition I now state, and what nobody will
            deny, that the great and paramount purpose of the Constitution is to establish and
            maintain the Government. Then, notwithstanding the resignation of seventeen members in
            this body, although we thought we were disorganized, we never were, but were always a
            competent legislative body. The Constitution of the State, in prescribing the number of members which shall constitute
            the Senate and House of Representatives, is silent, as to numbers. I prescribe the
            maximum but not the minimum, or intermediate number, which leaves that action to the
            Legislature itself. The Legislature, in the exercise of the powers delegated to it, has
            determined that the Senate shall consist of fifty and the House of Representatives of
            one hundred members. Now the word "shall" is a word that is used with various
            significance, but it is not so used in this Constitution, nor in the law. Were the law
            to read: "The Senate is to be composed of fifty members," it would answer the
            requirements of the Constitution, just as well as the present language, and more
            correctly express the true idea than does the word "shall," as it is
            considered. "Shall" does not mean that there must at all times be fifty
            members. Why do I arrive at this conclusion? Because the Constitution provides that
            there shall be a less number - it provides for vacancies, and it in no instance declares
            that the remaining members do not constitute a valid and legal legislative assembly.
            Otherwise we would always have to have the full number of fifty in this House, and one
            hundred if the other. It is the maximum number which is the complement. It nowhere
            requires that this number shall be full.
          What is the language of the Constitution with reference to a quorum? It says that
            "two-thirds of each House shall constitute a quorum." Two thirds composed of
            what? An abstract number. I hold that we are bound to construe this with reference to
            the continuance of Government. How further, does a proper construction of the
            Constitution maintain this view? Does it say that, in the absence of members, we are to
            hold special elections?
          Mr BRADLEY (interposing). Suppose forty were to resign, would two thirds of ten go on
            with business?
          Mr WOLCOTT That is an absurd question to ask. There is no general proposition that
            cannot, be pushed to an extreme that would be impracticable I will admit that when, by
            resignation or other circumstances, the number should become small it would be proper to
            take some steps not incompatible with the Constitution. How ever small the number of
            members may be reduced to, I admit that propriety on the part of the remaining members
            would indicate that, they should adjourn, but I deny that when three, four or seventeen
            seats are vacant, when the great principle of representation is fully in force and
            recognized, that there should be an adjournment because of the vacancies. Take the
            present instance, for circumstances have something to do with - 
          Mr HOOPER interposed. Will the Senator give way. I will now offer this resolution for
            consideration. [The same as printed above. In addition to the amendment suggested by Mr
            Stein, Mr. Huey's district was struck out]
          Mr WOLCOTT I will admit that the question would be somewhat, different were seventeen
            districts unrepresented by no fault of their's. But they are not represented
            because they refuse to come into his body. There is no accident overwhelming them. The
            majority are exercising no arbitrary power. It is an unreasonable thing for seventeen or
            any minority, willfully refusing to discharge their duties, or wilfully refusing to
            accept the rights and privileges they might enjoy, to prevent the majority from
            discharging their duties or exercising their rights and privileges. To do so would be a
            torturing construction of the Constitution, and in effect a defeat, of the purposes for
            which that instrument was made. I admit that the construction for which I contend is not
            the construction which has ordinarily obtained, that it is not the first time in this
            country, after long years, that new views and correct views of statutes and
            Constitutions have obtained Exigencies arise that demand critical examinations, and from
            these examinations new conclusions are arrived at.
          Then the language of the Constitution in relation to a majority necessary to pass a
            bill says. "A majority of all the members elected to said House shall be necessary
            to pass every bill or joint resolution." It dont say a majority of fifty in this
            House and one hundred in the other, but a majority of members elected" Now who are
            members elected to this body? They are persons who have received the votes that enabled
            them to qualify, and who have qualified. Suppose by reason of some irregularity that
            should amount to illegality in some districts that there should be no election, or that
            the people were so apathetic or dissatisfied or for some reason they should refuse to go
            into an election, and but forty members were elected, would it require a majority of
            fifty to pass a bill? A majority of actual members is the language of the Constitution,
            and shall we torture the construction of this provision of the Constitution to make it
            mean different from what it reads, in order to destroy our own existence? It seems to me
            that we are called upon to do no such thing. But I have no disposition to prolong this
            discussion. I think the presentation of the points and a clear statement of them is
            sufficient to construe the whole argument.
          
          Mr HOOPER I would inquire whether my resolution has its place?
          LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR requested Mr W c to send up his resolution in writing, deciding
            that it should be disposed of first.
          Mr WOLCOTT. I will withdraw my motion for the time being.
          Mr HOOPER I do not propose to enter into any discussion of the question presented by
            this resolution, to any extent whatever, because I submitted my views upon th question
            on Saturday. But it has been suggested by the Senator from Laporte (Mr Bradley) that
            this matter ought not now to be pressed, but that we ought to wait patiently. How long
            he would have us to wait he would not tell us.
          Mr BRADLEY If the Senator will allow me I do not know exactly how long. I stated that I
            thought a resolution like this was impolitic. I have received information that the House
            is organized; and I suppose if that is done that the Senate will be organized, and I
            really hope the Senate will take no action upon this resolution I do not man the Senate.
            I mean this fraction of the Senate. I thought it impolitic to act in this way lest it
            might destroy the whole object of the organization of the House. Because if this body
            passes a resolution declaring the seats of certain Senators vacant, which I contend it
            has no right to do, the Governor may act upon it: - I don't believe he will, but he
            possibly may and if he does we destroy the General Assembly for the present. Hence I
            hope the Senator will not press his resolution.
          Mr GREEN. I will ask if the Senator don't think this the most speedy way we can
            organize the Sentae?
          Mr BRADLEY. I think not. I you will never organize it in that way.
          Mr HOOPER, resuming, spoke in favor of the adoption of his resolution, though he was
            not specially desirous of pressing it to a vote to day. When he had concluded - 
          Mr BRADLEY seated objections to the ruling of the Lieutenant Governor on Saturday in
            entertaining Mr Craven's resolution and ruling out Mr Green's.
          On motion by Mr SCOTT the further consideration of the resolution was postponed till
            to-morrow at 2 o'clock P. M.
          Mr. WOLCOTT renewed his motion in the shape of resolution, and moved that it be made
            the special order for the same hour.
          Tne LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR It Will be read for information.
          
            
              
                Resolved, That inasmach as there is a quorum of all the members
                  that are qualified under the Constitution as Senators present the President be and
                  is hereby directed to proceed with the business of the Senate as the same now
                  stands upon the calendar.
              
            
          

          Mr. BRADLEY I object to that and raise the point of order - 
          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR I think the resolution is not to order.
          Mr. SCOTT. I move that the districts be called where vacancies exist, and also the name
            of the Senator elect.
          Mr. BRADLEY They will be here in a few minutes - they are not here yet. Sotto voce - I have sent for them [Laughter]
          Subsequently - the Senators elect appearing in the chamber - 
          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR said: The Secretary will now call the districts with the names
            of the persons said to be elected from those districts, and Senators will come forward
            and present their credentials.
          As their names were called, the newly elected Senators came forward to the area in
            front of the President's desk, in the following order:
          
            
              
                
                  From the county of Vanderburgh - Daniel Morgan.
                  From the counties of Knox and Daviess - W. S. Turner.
                  From the counties of Pike, Dubois and Martin - W. H. Montgomery.
                  From the counties of Perry, Orange and Crawford - W F Sherrod.
                  From the counties of Washington and Harrison - George W Denbo.
                  From the counties of Ohio and Dearborn - Elijah Huffman.
                  From the county of Franklin - Thomas Gifford.
                  From the counties of Green and Owen - John Humphries.
                  From the counties of Clay and Sullivan - James M Hanna.
                  From the county of Montgomery - Archibald Johnson.
                  From the counties of Huntington and Wells - Wilson Smith.
                
              
            
          
          The oath of office was administered by Hon. George H Chapman, Judge of the Marion
            Criminal Court.
          A message from the House of Representatives announced the organization of that
            body.
          Mr. FISHER offered the following:
          
            
              
                Resolved That the officers and employes of the Senate during
                  the late regular session, be continued during the special session unless hereafter
                  otherwise ordered.
              
            
          
          On motion by Mr. JOHNSON of Montgomery, the words "and employes" were struck
            out.
          The resolution as amended was adopted.
          Resolutions authorizing a joint committee to wait upon the Governor, informing the
            House of the organization of the Senate; and appointing a Committee on Rules, were
            adopted.
          Mr. OCHMIG BIRD, Senator elect from the counties of Adams and Allen, appeared and was
            qualified by the Lieutenant Governor.
          And then the Senate adjourned until three o'olock tomorrow.
        

        

        
          HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
          Mr STANTON, Speaker of the former session, called the House to order at, two
            o'clock P M , and ordered the Clerk to call the House
          The CLERK called the qualified members of the House of Representatives, with the
            following result:

            Mr. Ratliff submitted the following:
            
              
                
                  Resolved, That all the elective officers of the House who were elected at the
                    Regular Session in January last are entitled to hold their respective offices
                    during the official continuance of the present General Assembly.
                
              
            
            Mr. RATLIFF read the following clause from the act of March 4, 1865 providing for the
              completion of Unfinished Business of any session of the General Assembly, by the next
              succeeding special session of the same General Assembly:
            "The business of any regular or special session of the General Assembly, on the
              Calendar or Files of either House and remaining unfinished at the expiration of such
              session, shall at the next succeeding special session of the same General Assembly, be
              transferred to the Calendar of the House in which it was pending in the same order in
              which such business stood at the termination of such regular or special session, to be
              taken up, transacted and disposed of," &c.
            Whereupon he reasoned that, as this is the XLVIth General Assembly, in Special
              session, and as the Calendar of business passes from the former to the present
              session, so a just and legal interpretation of this clause of the act of 1865, would
              require the officiary of the last session to hold during the continuance of this.
            Mr. McFADIN supported the resolution as required by the statute, and sustained by
              precedents in the proceedings of tbe Congress of the United States.
            Mr. COFFROTH showed, that, to refuse to adopt, thus resoulution would be equivalent
              to a declaration that the Stature of 1865 is a nullity which he deprecated because of
              the time saved by it in the dispatch of legislative business. He also showed by the
              Journal of the special session of 1865, that the resolution offered by Mr. Newcomb,
              which continued and passed the Speakership of the Hon John U Petit and all the
              officiary of the regularsession to the special session of the sme General Assembly
              puts a legislative construction upon the act of 1865 which requires the adoption of
              the resolution. He also showed that the continuance of the officiary during the
              official existence of the body is sustained by Cushing's Manual, and precedent in
              the Congress of the United States.
            Mr WILDMAN indicated the previous question, but withheld the demand, for -
            Mr. OSBORN, who would not have said anything but for the remarks of the gentleman
              from Huntington. He insisted that the fact of offering this resolution admits wrong
              the case of his advocates - that these officers of the former session are
              "entitled to act" - for if they were so entitled by law, where is the
              nescessity of this resolution?
            Mr. COFFROTH I was simply to give a legislative construction to the act.
            Mr. OSBORN The act needed no construction. I was intended to facilitate the
              transaction of business after the House is organized. One session of the Legislature
              can not control the organization of another session. The General Assembly is to be
              organized when assembled - each House for itself. Here he read the appropriate clause
              from the tenth section of the Legislative article of the Constitution of the State. He
              showed, also, that this is not precisely the same House that was organized here are
              the beginning of the year. And if the Speaker had resigned, and had been returned,
              like other gentlemen here to day, would he have been entitled to the Chair? When the
              House is assembled, the first act is to organized. And the fact that this resolution
              has been offered proves his proposition. Gentlemen say this is the same House that met
              here in January; when we have had here for four or five days, the best evidence in the
              world that this is not true. For four or five days we have been unable to obtain a
              quorum. And since the 4th day in March, we have had no General Assembly. He had no
              choice, and should express none, as to who should fill these offices. When he had
              concluded, and Mr. McFadin had replied -
            Mr. ZOLLARS demanded the previous question, and there being a second to the demand,
              the main question was ordered. - the voted thereon - by yeas and nays resulting - yeas
              62, nays 31 - as follows:

            So the resolution was adopted.
            Mr. COFFROTH moved to reconsider the vote, and to lay the motion on the table.
            The latter motion was agreed to without a division.
            The SPEAKER (Mr. Stanton of Marion), then addressed the House as follows:
            
              Gentleman of the House of Representatives:
            
            I desire at this time to return to you my sincere thanks for the uniform kindness and
              courtesy which you have extended to me during our association in this body, and
              particularly in the relation that has existed between us since my occupation of the
              chair In the beginning I assured you that I could not bring to the discharge of my
              duties that legislative experience so so necessary to one occupying this position, and
              only promised you that actuated by an earnest purpose, I would faithfully endeavor to
              discharge the dune devolving upon me. I trust that I may flatter myself with the
              belief that you beat me out in the reflection that I have been true to my promise.
            Believing that I can represent my constituency quite as well upon the floor as on the
              Chair (and perhaps better), and confessing that I have found my arduous and
              responsible dutites not altogether to my liking, I desire again to thank you for your
              many and renewed expressions of kindness and confidence before carrying out a
              determination some time since formed. Gentlemen, I respectfully resign my position as
              Speaker of this House.
            When he had concluded this address, he called Mr Gordon, of Boone to the Chair.
            On the motion of Mr PIERCE, of Porter, the House (by unanimous consent) proceeded to
              the election of a Speaker.
            Mr PIERCE nominated George A Buskirk, of Monroe.
            Mr. SHOEMAKER nominated James D Williams, of Knox.
            Those voting for Mr Buskirk were:
            
              
                
                  Messrs. Baker, Barnett, Beauty, Beeler, Bowen, Beckinridge, Chapman, Davidson,
                    Davis of Elkhart, Dunn, Fairchild, Field of Lake, Field of Lagrange, Furnas,
                    Gilham, Gordon, Greene, Hall, Hamilton, Higbee, Higgins, Hutson, Johnson of

                    Mitchell, Monroe, Osburn, Overmeyer, Pierce of Porter, Pierce of Vigo, Radiff,
                    Ruddell, Sabin, Skidmore, Smith, Stanton, Stephenson, Stewart of Ohio, Stewart
                    of Rush, Taber, Underwood, Vardeman, Vater, Wildman, Williams of Hamilton,
                    Williams on Knox, Williams of St. Joseph, Williams of Union, and Wilson -55
                  Those voting for Mr Williams were:
                  Messrs Addison, Admire, Barritt, Bates, Bobo, Bitton, Buskirk, Calvert,
                    Carnahan, Cave, Cofforth, Cory, Cotton, Cox, Dittemore, Fuller, Hutchings,
                    Hyatt, Johnson of Montgomery, Lawler, Logan, Long, McDonald, Mcfadin, McGregor,
                    Miles, Miner, Mock, Montgomery, Neff, Odell, Palmer, Shoaff, Shoemaker, Sleath,
                    Sppman, Tebbs, Welborn, Wile and Zellars - 5.
                
              
            
            The PRESIDING OFFICER pro tem having declared Mr Buskirk to be duly selected, Mr
              Williams of Knox, and Mr. Stanton, were called on to conduct the Speaker of the
              Chair.
            That service having been formally rendered -
            The Speaker said:
            
              Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:
            
            I return to you my sincere thanks for the distinguished honor that you have just
              conferred on me in selecting me to preside over your deliberations.
            This mark of your confidence, I assure you is highly appreciated; and it shall be my
              highest ambition, by a fair, faithful and impartial discharge of my duties to
              continute to merit it.
            It is not, however, without great diffidence that I proceed to enter upon the
              discharge of the duties assigned me, conscious that I do not possess the familiarity
              with legislative proceedings so essential to enable me to discharge the duties of the
              chair in a prompt and efficient manner; and, did I not feel that I could safely rely
              upon your indulgence and assitance, I shoud shrink from the responsibilities that I am
              about to assume. The time limited to us under the Constitution is short; but if
              propery employed, it will be sufficient to enable us to enact all the nescessary
              legislation; and I indulge the hope that we will not adjourn until our work shall be
              completed. This much is demanded of us by every consideration of duty, and fidelity to
              the oath that we have just taken.
            
              THE FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT
              Mr. PIERCE, of Porter For the purpose of settling the difficulty which has kept our
                Democratic friends so long out in the cold, I submit the following:
              
                
                  
                    Resolved That the consideration of the ratification of the
                      fifteenth amendment proposed to the Constitution of the United States be
                      postponed until Tuesday, the eleventh day of May next.
                  
                
              
              Mr WILDMAN demanded the previous question, and there being a second, &c;, the
                order was adopted without a division.
              Mr MCFADIN moved to reconsider the vote.
              On motion of Mr. COFFROTH, Mr.McFadin's
                resolution was laid on the table.
              Mr. WILLIAMS, of Knox, submitted the following:
              Resolved That the rules of the last session shall govern the
                present session.
              It was adapted by consent.
              Mr WILLIAMS, of Knox, submitted the following:
              Resolved That each member be entitled to the same seat occupied
                by him at the last session.
              It was adopted on a division--affirmative 71, negative not counted.
              Mr. WILDMAN submitted the following order, which was adopted:
              Resolved, That the Senate be notified that the House organized
                with the Hon. George A Buskirk, Speaker; William M Merwio, Clerk; John O. Hardesty,
                Assistant Clerk and T.H McCoun, Doorkeeper, and that the House is now ready to
                proceed to business.
              Mr. RATLIFF submitted an order for the appointment of a committee of three to
                report on the amount of stationery to be allowed.
              0n motion of Mr. GORDON it was laid on the table.
              The House then adjourned till to-morrow morning at nine o'clock.
            
          
        

        
          IN SENATE.
          
            TUESDAY, April 13, 1869.
          
          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR called the Senate to order at 9 o'clock A. M , parsuant to
            adjournment, and said: In the opinion of the Chair there is a quorum present. The
            Secretary will read the journal of yesterday.
          The Secretary's minutes having been read.
          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR, I see the Senators from Bartholomew, Allen and Cass; if they
            will come forward I will administer the oath.
          Accordingly Messrs. Lee, Carson and Laselle came forward and were sworn into
            office.
          
            RULES AND ORDERS.
            Mr. STEIN, from the Committee on Rules of the Senate, reported the rules of last,
              session, with changes in rules Nos. 8 20 36 and 40, and inserting 37 and 38 of the
              session of 1867.
            fter debate thereon, the amendments were adopted, except the amendment proposed to
              rule 36.
            On motion of Mr. STEIN, 200 copies were ordered printed.
            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR announced that he should make no changes in the standing
              committees of the Senate, in reply to an itqairy by Mr. Armstrong Concerning the
              printing of the standing 4committees in the rules, which was so ordered.
          
          
            CORRECTION.
            Mr. FISHER, Mr. President: I see here is some incorrect report made in the JOURNAL of
              this morning [Be read as follows from yesterday's proceedings immediately
              following Mr. Hooper's resolution]:
            "Mr. BRADLEY I rise to a point of order, or I will say this : I would prefer
              that the resolution would be with drawn for the present. I have an idea which is very
              strong that we will get along with the organization in a very short time: but if that
              is thrust in, the organization will be farther delayed. I hope the Senator will nt
              press the resolution.
            "Mr FISHER (in his seat) How long shall we wait? Forty days and forty
              nights?
            "Mr FISHER(continuing) No sir. not forty days and forty nights, The point of
              order is that we can't pass a resolution. The preamble is not-I shan't say
              it is not true, but we have no right to declare a thiug that we don't know
              whether it is true or not."
            This last, instead of being the language of "Mr Fisher," is the language of
              "Mr. Bradley."
            Although it has proved to be a fact that he do not have to wait so long, yet I do not
              want to appropriate the hours that properly belong to the Senator from Laporte [Mr
              Bradley].
            Mr BRADLEY. I do not know whether the matter is debateable, but I think it is hardly
              worth while to correct it, for any person that would read the paper would know--
            [The remainder of the sentence was drowned by the laughter of Senators near the
              speaker.]
            Mr CHURCH, from the special joint committee appointed to wait upon the Governor,
              reported that it would be his pleasure to meet the two Houses in the
              Representatives' Hall at four o'clock P. M , to day.
          
          
            PETITIONS.

              abolishing April elections.
            Mr CASE presented petitions praying for the prohibition of the liquor traffic.
          
          
            EMPLOYES.
            Mr. GIFFORD offered a resolution, which was adopted, authorizing a committee of three
              to limit the number of employes.

            On motion by Mr. WOLCOTT, it was laid on the table--yeas 28; nays 14.
          
          
            UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE AMENDMDNT.
            M. CRAVENS, Stating, among other things, that the Constitutional Amendment has never
              been before this body except as presented through the message of the Gov-ernor, offered the following (noting the floor to offer a
              concurrent resolution, the purpose of what he indicated):
            A joint resolution accepting and ratifying a certain amendment to the Constitution of

                    when ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the States, shall be
                    valid, for all intents and purposes, as a part of this Constitution panel. :

                  "SECTION 1 The right of the citizen of the United States to vote shall not
                    be denied or abridged by the United States, or by any State on account of race,

                  "SEC 2 The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by

                  Wherefore
                  Be it Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of
                      Indiana that said fifteenth Amendment the the Constitution of the United
                    States is hereby accepted and ratified on the part of the State of Indiana.
                
              
            
            The resolution having been read by the Secretary -
            Mr. CRAVENS said: Now, Mr. President, the resolution is before the body and in order
              to dispose of it for the present and in order that it may not be in the way of
              legislation -
            Mr JOHNSON of Montgomery. Is this the first reading of the joint resolution?
            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR A joint resolution is not required to be read three times. At
              least it has been the custom here to read joint resolutions but once.
            Mr CRAVENS Now for the purpose of disposing of this resolution, and getting clear of
              it for the present, and in order to fix the time when it shall be considered, I offer
              the following resolution:
            
              
                
                  Resolved by the Senate the House of Representatives
                      concurring, That the consideration of the joint resolution accepting and
                    ratifying on the part of Indiana, the proposed Fifteenth Amendmet to the
                    Constitution of the United States be postponed and made the special order for
                    action at 2 o'clock PM on Tuesday, the eleventh day of May next ensuing in
                    joint Assembly of the two Houses to be held in the Hall of the House of
                    Representatives on said day and said hour.
                
              
            
            Mr. CRAVENS, Now, Mr President the resolution explains itself. I demand the previous
              question.
            Mr HANNA. There is such a thing as fairness in the prosecution of the business of
              this body. I hope the Senator will withdraw the motion for the previous question. This
              is a proposition to raise a joint convention of the two Houses, and that is outside of
              the understanding.
            Mr. CRAVENS If there is any understanding about it, I do not know it.
            Mr. HANNA. I ask the members of the majority whether they want to stop this session
              here?
            Mr GIFFORD (in his seat). I desire to leave in case this is pressed.
            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR The previous question having been demanded, the Chair is
              obliged to stop the discussion.
            The Senate refused to second the demand for the previous question upon a division -
              affirmative 17; negative, 20.
            Mr. HANNA I move now to strike out that portion providing for a joint convention of
              the two Houses.
            The motion was rejected by yeas 20, nays 24 as follows:

                    Wood -24
                
              
            
            Mr. HANNA I do not want to act hastily on this matter I want to make one more effort
              in good faith For the present I move to lay both resolutions on the table - till we
              can have a talk with our friends.
            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR It was not competent to move to lay two subjects on the
              table, but inasmuch as these seem to belong to each other, it may be proper, though I
              am not quite clear about it.
            The motion was entertained by the Chair, the yeas and nays were called and
            Mr. ANDREWS, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote said: I really wish
              to take no advantage of our opponents in regard to this question.
            Mr. HANNA. (interposing ) I withdraw my motion for the present, as several Senators
              say they want to hear the question discussed. He said the minority are ready to take
              up all the legitimate legislation nescessary to carry on the affairs of the State
              Government, and perhaps a great deal more, but stand here desiring to opposed the
              adoption of the Constitutional Amendment. He opposed the concurrent resolution
              proposing a joint convention for the consideration of the amendment on the 11th of
              May, because it is outside of the arrangement made with me we consider honorable, and
              who will stand up to their engagements, and consequently would be a breach of good
              faith &c.
            Mr CRAVENS regarded a vote upon this Constitutional Amendment as a part of the
              necessary legislation of the State; and as a proposition confluencing with any pledges
              of obligations known to him. He was not fully clear by that a majority of the Senate
              and House constututed the Legislature.
            Mr SCOTT was of the opinion that a joint convention without a quorum of thetwo Houses was a nullity and with that view could not see
              that this proposition was a breach of good faith.
            Mr BRADLEY declared that what he did to bring in a quorum of the Senate was done
              upond faith in the verbal promises made to him personally by Senators of the opposite
              party; and he would regard the passage of the resoution such a breach of good faith as
              to put it out of his power forever to trust the promises of gentlemen from the other
              side. Strike out of the concurrent resolution all that looks to a joint convention,
              and he would be willing to see it pass.
            Mr GIFFORD came up here fully instructed to vote and use his influence to prevent the
              ratification of this proposed Amendment, until the people have had a fair opportunity
              to express themselves at the polls on this subject. He was instructed to resign at
              every full change of the moon if nescessary to defeat this measure.
            Mr HOOPER'S view was that if a quorum should not be here, then the adoption of
              this constitutional amendment would be inoperative and void. Therefore, he saw no act
              of bad faith whatever in the proposition before the Senate.
            Mr. HANNA, expressed some doubts as to the legality of a ratification made by a joint
              convention, in an argument which he made to this point. When he had concluded -
            Mr JOHNSON of Montgomery, offered the following amendment:
            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR Before the amendment is considered I would like to lay before
              the Senated a message received from the House, as it perhaps ought to be acted upon
              before the adjournment
            The Secretary read the House concurrent resolution for a joint convention to secure
              the services of a minister of the Gospel to open the session in joint convention, this
              afternoon, with prayer
            The resolution was concurred in
            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR makes the committee on the part of the Senate to consist of
              Messrs. Hanna, Hamilton and Morgan.
            The Secretary read the resolution of the House inviting the Senate to join
              convention, at 4 o'clock, to receive the Governor's message.
            Mr HANNA What would be the ruling of the Chair on the subject of adjourning that
              convention to another day?
            Mr CHURCH. I do not think the Chair called upon to determine a question which is to
              arise in the future.
            Mr HANNA I have great confidence -
            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR The Chair would not hesitate to give a ruling when such a
              question may arise. I do not think that the Chair has any power over a joint
              convention.
            Mr HANNA Under that decision, I will not object to the resolution
            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR Is there any objectioin to the consideration of the
              resolution?
            Mr. HANNA I move to postpone its consideration until two o'clock
            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR If there is any objection, it cannot be taken up
            Mr. JOHNSON of Montgomery's amendment was then read as follows:
            "Strike out a'l that refers to a conccourrence of the two Houses and strike
              out that part which refers to joint convention of the two Houses"
            Mr. BELLAMY The amendment is out of order, or cause a motion of that kind has been
              voted down.
            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. It is slightly different, aud the chair will rule it in
              order.
            Mr. LASELLE had not the least doubt but that if the Senate passed this resolution the
              House will pass it, at the day fixed, whether there be a quorum in either House or
              not; that a joint convention has the power to pass the resolution ratifying the
              Constitutional Amendment.
            Mr CHURCH spoke in favor of the resolutions, and at length against the principle of
              allowing minorities to dictate and shape legislation. When he had concluded -
            The Senate took a Recess till two o'clock P M.
          
          
            AFTERNOON SESSION.
            Mr STEIN contended that the passage of the concurrent resolution did not involve a
              breach of faith on the part of the Republican members of the Legislature. The members
              of that party are unrammled by any pledges, and the Democratic members came back to
              their seats not upon the strength of pledges made by our party. They came back at
              their own risk, without pledges
            Mr HANNA, in reply, urged considerations against the adoption of the resolution
            Mr FISHER believed that in the passage of the resolution we are acting in perfect
              good faith, and for one he was unwilling to yield to the dictation of the minority in
              this matter. He believed that a majority of the members of both Houses voting in joint
              convention in favor of the Constitutional Amendment would be sufficient. What is
              wanted is a majority of the Legislature
            Mr. GRAY should give his vote so as to bring about the passage of the measures
              believed the people to be most interested in, and then was ready to take up this
                Consti-tutional Amendment and vote upon it,
              whether we have a quorum or not.
            Mr. RICE contended that we could not pass the Constitutional Amendment with the
              Democrats outside. It the Democrats sit quietly by, here and in the House, and let
              this resolution pass, that organizes the joint convention with the majority, and that
              convention votes without respect to them, and you virtually effect the passage of the
              Constitutional Amendment to day.
            Mr. JOHNSON, of Montgomery, moved that the resolutions and pending amendment be
              postponed and made the specia1 order for the llth of May next.
            Mr. CRAVENS Inasmuch as this debate has gone as far as, perhaps, is practicable, and
              inasmuch as many of his party friends are not in favor ot the concurrent resolution,
              and inasmuch as he did not feel authorized to assume the responsibility of delaying
              legislation and further disturbing the harmony of this body, if the Senator from
              Montgomery would withdraw his amendment and motion to postpone, Mr. C. would put an
              end to the matter.
            Mr. JOHNSON of Montgomery. I would like to know what kind of an end? [Laughter]
            Mr CRAVENS. I will say to the Senator that I will put an end to it that will be
              satisfactory to him.
            Mr JOHNSON, of Montgomery. With the understanding that I have the privilege of the
              floor to press the same amendment, if it is not, satisfactory, I will withdraw it.
            Mr. CRAVENS. I go into no understanding
            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR Does the Senator from Montgomery withdraw the motion to
              postpone?
            Mr. JOHNSON, of Montgomery. Yes, sir
            Mr CRAVENS. Then with the consent of the Senate, in order to put, this matter at
              rest, and leave the whole matter and the whole responsibility in the hands of the
              majority, for them to take whatever course they see fit, I ask permission to withdraw
              both the joint resolution and the concurrent resolution.
            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR Is there any objection? The Chair hears no object. It is no
              ordered. The Chair lays before the Senate this message from the House.
            The Secretary read an invitation for the Senate to attend in joint convention, at
              four o'clock, in teh hall of the House, to hear the Governor's message.
            The invitation was accepted, and the hour having arrived and passed, Senators
              repaired to the Hall of the House instanter.
            When they returned-
            The Senate adjourned till 2 o'clock P M, tomorrow.

          The House met at nine o'clock A M, and the journal of yesterday having been read
            and authenticated -
          A message from the Senate was received announcing formally the organization of that
            body, and the appointment on their part of a joint special committee to wait on the
            Governor with such a formation, &c.
          On motion of Mr. PIERCE, of Porter, the House formally reponded to this message by the
            appointment of Messrs Pierce of Porter, Stanton and Coffroth as said committee on the
            part of the House.

              ON BANKS
            
            Messrs. Kercheval, Green, Fuller, Davis, of Elkhart, Williams of S. Joseph, Beatty,

            On the motion of Mr. PIERCE of Vigo, it was ordered that Messrs Johnston of Parke,

            RESOLUTIONS AND ORDERS.
            On motion of Mr. OSBORN it was

            

            
              
                
                  Resolved, That the Special Railroad Committee of the last
                    session he continued with all the powers given them at the last session. 
                
              
            

            Mr. RATLIFF submitted the following:

            
              
                
                  WHEREAS, Sundry papers taken by this House at the last
                    session are still sent to the House Post office and received by members: And
                    whereas, the reception of said papers by the members implies a contradict for
                    the same. And whereas, this House deems it an unnecessary expenditure of the
                    people's money; therefore,

                  Resolved That each member and office of this House be allowed
                    one copy daily of the Indianapolis DAILY JOURNAL and one copy daily of the Indianapolis Daily
                      Sentinel and that the Doorkeeper be and he is hereby authorized to
                    contract or and have the same delivered.
                
              
            

            Mr. UNDERWOOD proposed to submit a proposition to allow to each member such copies of
              daily and weekly newspapers as he may select - the aggregate number not to exceed
              eight copies, which he subsequently withdrew.

            Mr RATLIFF showed the economy of the adoption of the resolution.

            Mr. PIERCE, of Porter, objected to the resolution on the ground that he preferred to
              make his own selection of papers

            Mr. Cunningham, a representative for Fountain county, now came forward with his
              credentials, received the oath of office at the hands of the Speaker, and took his
              seat on the floor.

            Mr. LONG submitted a substitute for Mr Ratliff's resolution, that a committee of
              five be appointed to inquire what stationary, stamps, and newspaper shall be furnished
              to each member. The substitute was agreed to, and so amended the resolution was
              adopted.

            Mr. PIERCE of Porter, from the joint special committee to wait on the Governor
              reported that his Excellency will be prepared to deliver a message to the two houses
              of the General Assembly at four o'clock this afternoon, and thereupon - 

            On the further motion of Mr. PIERCE, of Porter, it was ordered that the Senate be
              invited to seats within the bar of the House at the hour for that purpose.

            Mr. OSBORN submitted the following:

            
              
                
                  Resolved, That a committee of five be appointed by the Chair, to revise the

            GOVERNOR'S MESSAGE.

            
              
                
                  
                  
                     Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives:
                  

                  No one more sincerely than myself regrets the necessity which existed for
                    convening Special Session of the General Assembly at this time. The duty Of
                    calling you together at the earliest practicable period after the termination of
                    the late regular session was so obvious that I do not intend to occupy a moment
                    of your time in justification or explanation of the proclamation in pursuance of
                    which you are now assembled. By the resignation seventeen Senators and
                    thirty-five Representatives, two days prior to to the last legislative day of
                    the late regular session, the General Assembly was practicably discovered, the
                    quorm being, by said resignations, destroyed in both Houses. When this happened,
                    no appropriations had been made to meet the ordinary expenditures o the State
                    Government for the years 1869 and 1870, or for the support of the benevolent and
                    other public institutions of the State during the same period.

                  The fact that the General Assembly has, on three different occasionss within
                    the last twelve years, been disbanded by the action of a minority of its members
                    before the appropriations necessary to carry on the State government and meet
                    the current expenses of the benevolent institutions had been passed, seems to
                    imperatively demand that these absolutely necessary appropriations should be so
                    provided for by a permanent and continuing law that they shall be placed beyond
                    and above the demands and vicissitudes of mere party organizations. To this end,
                    I respectfully recommend the passage of an act providing that, whenever the
                    General Assembly, at its regular biennial session, shall fail to pass laws
                    making appropriations for the ordinary expenses of the State government and for
                    the support of its benevolent and other public institutions, then it shall be
                    competent for the State officers to direct the Auditor of State to draw his
                    warrant on the State Treasury for the amounts necessary for the purposes, not
                    exceeding, however, the amounts appropriated for the same purposes for the last
                    year for which appropriations shall have been made. It would be no difficult
                    matter to frame a law of this kind so as to securely guard the treasury against
                    improper drafts being made upon it, and at the same time protect the public
                    interests [against?] the consequences of a
                    failure or the part of the General Assembly to make these necessary
                    appropriations. In the absence of such a law, whenever the General Assembly
                    fails to pass the necessary appropriation bills, the State government must
                    either cease to perform its functions, and the inmates of th benevolent
                    institutions be disbanded, or loans must be contracted without the authority of
                    law to enable these functions to be carried on and these institutions to be
                    supported. I think no candid man will dispute the correctness of the proposition
                    that when one branch of the State government fails or refuses to perform a clear
                    duty which it alone is competent to perform, another branch of the same
                    government should not by such failure be left in a position in which it can not
                    perform its own duties without assuming powers not conferred by the Constitution
                    and laws. The provision I am asking you to make for all these ordinary and
                    necessary expenditures has long since been adopted in relation to the
                    Institution for the Deaf and Dumb.

                  By the law governing that Institution, ample provision is made for drawing
                    money from the Treasury for its ordinary expenses in the even that the
                    Legislature should fail to make the regular biennial appropriation.

                  At your late session, in passing the general revenue law, you wisely made the
                    tax a continuous one until changed by the law. This was, doubtless, done to meet
                    the contingency of a failure to pass a revenue law. I ask that the same
                    principle be adopted respecting such approprations as are absolutely necessary
                    for the continuance of the State government and the support of public
                    institutions of the State. 

                  I trust, now that you are again in session, that you will, without distinction
                    of party, feel that your first and paramount duty is to make the appropriations
                    which the exigencies of the public service so manifestly demand

                  The Constitution of State in terms declares that "it shall be the duty of
                    the General Assembly to provide by law for the support of institutions for the
                    education of the deaf and dumb and the blind, and also for the treatment of the
                    insane." Every member of this General Assembly, in common with myself has
                    taken an oath to support the Constitution of which the section quoted is a part.
                    Here then is a plain duty, binding upon every member, regardless of his party
                    affiliations or relationships. Now, shall a plan duty like this, concerning
                    which honest, intelligent minds cannot differ, be subordinated to or made
                    dependent upon any other question of party politics upon which here may be an
                      [?] stand an earnest difference of opinion?
                    I trust not. I hope you will, with the least practicable delay, make the
                    uncessary appropriations, and especially those required to meet the liabilities
                    already contracted by the Trustees of the State Normal School, the Commissioners
                    of the  House of Refuge, and the Trustees of
                    the Soldiers' Home. The managers of these Institutions have been greatly
                    embarrassed by reason of the fact that provision has not been made for the
                    payment of these debts, and the gentlemen who have made advances for these
                    Institution have been put to in convenience by reason of the non-payment of
                    these advances

                  Having, at the opening of the last regular session, given to you such
                    information touching the condition of the State as was thought necessary, and
                    having recommended such measures as were judged to be expedient, I deem it only
                    necessary now to refer you to the message then communicated instead of restating
                    the same information and reiterating the same recommendations. I beg, however,
                    before closing to submit for your consideration a supplemental report of the
                    Trustees of the Soldiers' Home, setting forth the necessity which exists
                    for such an institution, and demonstrating that it should receive from the State
                    a more liberal support than was proposed to be given by the General
                    Appropriation bill which passed the House at the last session.

                  By the Revenue bills passed at the late session, the State Debt Sinking Fund
                    tax was reduced one-half,or from twenty cents to ten cents on each one hundred
                    dollars in property, and the State debt tax proper was reduced one-fourth, or
                    from twenty cents to fifteen cents. This is certainly a satisfactory reduction,
                    and if local taxation could be reduced in a corresponding ratios, there would be
                    little cause of complaint of the burthess of taxation With this large reduction,
                    the State will still be in a condition to make all the appropriations
                    contemplated at the regular session and increase the allowance to the
                    Soldiers' Home to the extent asked for by the Trustees of that institution.
                    I believe that duty to our disabled soldiers, and to the orphan children of
                    those who have passed away, requires this at our hands A careful study of the
                    facts stated in the supplemental report of the Trustees will convince any
                    unprejudiced mind of the necessity of such an institution, and of increased
                    liberally in your appropriations for its enlargement and support

                  I herewith also respectfully submit for your consideration a supplemental
                    report of the Directors of the State Prison South showing that, for reasons
                    therein set forth, the finances of said prison are not in so favorable a
                    condition as was represented in the late annual report of the Directors. This
                    discrepancy grows out of the fact, as the supplemental report alleges, that the
                    late Warden had contracted debts on account of the prison no account of which
                    was contained on the books, and no report of which was made to the Directors.
                    This supplemental report also asks an appropriation for repairs; and shows that
                    the number of prisoners is decreasing, and that Marion county should be
                    re-annexed to the Southern Prison District.

                  Since the close of the late regular session, I have been informed by M P Ghee,
                    Esq, one of the Directors of said Prison, that he has accepted an appointment
                    under the General Government (viz: that of Guager of Distilled Spirit) and
                      [?] qualified, thereby Vacating his office
                    of Director of the Prison. I herewith submit a copy of his letter announcing the
                    fact, to the end that you may take such steps to fill the vacancy as to you may
                    seem proper. 

                  I trust you will have a pleasant and harmonious session, and that your
                    deliberations will result in the passage of such measures as will be promotive
                    of the welfare of teh State and the happiness of the people.

            Mr. McFADIN moved a vote of thanks to the authors of the message and the prayer,
              which was taken by consent: and then - 

            The Convention adjourned without day.

            And when the SPEAKER resumed the Chair -

            The House adjourned. 
          
          
          
        
        

        
          IN SENATE.
          
            WEDNESDAY, April 14, 1869.
          

          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR called the Senate to order at 2 o'clock P M.

          The Secretary's minutes of yesterday's proceedings were read.

          Mr. HADLEY returned from a special committee [?]
            Twelfth Judicial District Court bill [H. R. 64]
            with amendments.

          Mr. HANNA inquired of the Chair whether bills in the hands of committees at the
            adjournment of the regular session, were in the hands of the Legislature, or were still
            in the hands of the committees.

          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR decided that committees should go on and report the business
            before them, just as though there had been no adjournment, unless the Senate order
            otherwise. 

          
            THE GENERAL APPROPRIATION BILL.

            Mr. HANNA offered the following resolution, which was adopted:

            
              
                
                  
                    Resolved, That the Committee on Finance be
                    requested to return the General Appropriation bill for the action of the Senate
                    at an early day, with such recommendations as they may make.
                
              
            

          
          

          
            RULES AND ORDERS.

            Mr. STEIN offered the following:

            
              
                
                  
                    Resolved, That at the opening of each day's session of
                    the Senate one hour be assigned to  general
                    business; after which the order of business adopted upon the motion of the
                    Senator from Monroe, at the last session, establishing a special calendar of
                    bills, be taken up and carried through from the point where it was left at the
                    said last session; and for the purpose of executing this resolution

                  Be it further Resolved, That the regular order of business be
                    suspended from day to day, after the first hour until the bills embraced in said
                    calander are duly disposed of.
                
              
            

            It being a propositions to change the rules, it lies on the table for one day, under
              a standing rule of the Senate.

            The following is the "order of business" adopted, a referred to in the

            STATIONERY AND STAMPS.

            Mr. HAMILTON offered the following:

            
              
                
                  
                    Resolved, That the Librarian be authorized to furnish each
                    Senator with stationery and stamp to the amount of fifteen dollars, on his own
                    order, and each of the Standing Committess of Senate with five dollars in
                    stationery, on the order of the Chairman thereof.
                
              
            

            Mr. FISHER moved to strike out "$5" and insert "$10"

            Mr GIFFORD moved to include the Lieutenant Governor in the resolution.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR Nevermind that

            SEVERAL SENATORS - "Consent!"
              "consent!"

            The resolution, as amended, was rejected by yeas 21 nays 23.

            Mr. ROBINSON, of Decatur, in explanation of his vote, favored each member drawing as
              much stationery and stamps as he may need, and no more, and then let the amount drawn
              by each be published with the proceedings

            So the resolution was rejected. 

          
          

          
            ORDER OF BUSINESS

            Mr. HOOPER offered the following:

            
              
                
                  
                    Resolved, That all business remaining on the [?] and in the hands of the Committees at the close
                    of the regular session shall be taken up in the same manner as though the
                    regular session had been continued, except that no regard shall be had to the
                    special calendar adopted at the close of the last session.
                
              
            

            Mr HANNA moved its reference to a special committee.

            Mr. FISHER saw no necessity for its reference

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR decided that the resolution should be over or one day.
              Inasmuch as it recognizes a calendar of business, it in effect proposes a change of
              that rule.

            On motion, by Mr STEIN, all resolutions on that subject were made the special order
              for tomorrow's session.

            Mr SHERROD offered the following:

            
              Resolved, That a committee of three be appointed whose duty it shall
              be to inquire into and report the amount of stationery, stamp and now-papers needed by
              each Senator and Officer of the Senate.

            The resolution was rejected. 

          
          

          
            STATE PRISON REPORTS

            Mr. ANDREWS offered the following, which was adopted:

            
              
                
                  
                    Resolved, That the State Printer be directed to print 250
                    copies of the supplemntal report of the Directors of the State Prison south and
                    furnish 200 copies to the officers of the prison. Also that said Printer furnish
                    to the Senate the 200 copies of the report of the Northern Prison as ordered and
                    printed at the last regular session, and not delivered to the Senate.
                
              
            

          
          

          
            NEWSPAPERS

            Mr. BELLAMY offered the following:

            
              Resolved, That the Doorkeeper be authorized to contract for and
              place upon the desk of each Senator three copies of the daily Journal, three of the daily Sentinel, three of the Evening Commercial, three of the Mirror two of the
                Telegraph and two of the Volksblatt, two copies
              of each wrapped and stamped; Provided the said papers publish an accurate account of
              the proceeding of the General Assembly.

            Mr. GIFFORD said the papers last session were comparatively useless to his
              constituency, on account of the irregularity of the mails Papers directed on the 20th
              of  February did not reach a postoffice in his
              county, where there was a daily mail, until the 11 h of March. He moved to amend by
              including only the two principal papers.

            Mr. BELLAMY'S constituents desired to see an accurate account of our
              proceedings, and the resolution will bind the papers to make these reports

            Mr. HOOPER favored the amendment. The evening papers give but a short report of our
              proceedings, and for that reason he favored it.

            Mr. ROBINSON, of Decatur, complained of its taking two weeks last session for the
              papers to reach his county, on the line of the railroad

            Mr. CHURCH was of the opinion that the evening papers were edited with about as much
              ability as the others, and that we had better continue the usual custom.

            Mr. GIFFORD being informed that we have a new postmaster, and that the mails would
              probably be more regular hereafter, withdrew his motion.

            Mr. CRAVENS moved to amend by allowing each member and officer to select such paper
              as he may choose Last session, estimating each paper to cost three cents these
              newspapers cost the State over $7,000, He preferred spending a portion of that money
              in employing a competent reporter who could furnish full reports to the morning
              papers. He saw no use in throwing out money by the thousands for no good purpose. One
              paper will give the information to us as to what the other House is doing.

            Mr. TURNER'S constituents desired the papers and were willing to foot the bill.
              He favored taking them as heretofore.

            Mr. HANNA made some remarks to show if we should take one or two of the papers, for
              the same reason we should take them all.

            Mr. CHURCH desired both of the morning papers, and would like to amend the amendment
              by making it read the "two morning papers." 

            The amendment (Mr. Cravens') was rejected

            Mr. HADLEY opposed the resolution or account of the irregularity of the mails Then
              the distribution made of these papers was unfair.

            Mr ANDREWS moved to strike out of the resolution all except the morning papers.

            Mr. BELLAMY regarded the amendment as an unjust discrimination. 

            Mr. LASELLE desired to see the German papers retained in the resolution - three of
              the Telegraph and four of the Volksblatt. 

            Mr. LEE wanted to take all the papers named, and less stamps and stationery.

            Mr. BRADLEY agreed with Mr. Laselle in his view of this question, and hoped the
              amendment would be voted down.

            The amendment was rejected by yeas 21, nays 21.

            Mr. BELLAMY moved to include the President of the Senate in the resolution 

            SEVERAL SENATORS - "Consent," "consent."

            Mr. LASELLE moved to amend by striking out two inserting 'six copies of the
              Weekly Volksblatt."The amendment was rejected by yeas 16, nays 27.

            Mr. TURNER moved to strike out "2" and insert "5." The Volksblatt
              being a weekly paper, it is but just.

            Mr. STEIN demanded the previous question.

            The Senate Seconded the demand for the previous question, and under its operation - 

            The amendment was adopted by yeas 29, nays 15.

            And the resolution, as amended, was rejected by yeas 19, nays 25

            On motion by Mr. Johnson of Montgomery, it was-

            Ordered, That when the Senate adjourn it be till 9 o'clock A
              M. to-morrow. 

          
          

          
            SOUTHERN STATE PRISON.

            On motion by Mr. KINLEY, the Enrolling Clerk was directed to copy the report of the
                Committee on the Southern State Prison, for the use of the House
              of Representatives.

            The House concurrent resolution for Congressional legislation looking to reducing the
              extravagant rolls for passing around the Falls of the Ohio, at Louisvile, coming up in
              regular order-

            Mr. WOLCOTT understood the canal around the Falls to be private property, and could,
              therefore, see no propriety in passing this resolution.

            Mr. BELLAMY suggested that the proper way would be to memorialize Congress to put the
              canal on this side of the river.

            On motion by Mr. WOLCOTT, the resolution was referred to a special committee of
              three, which the CHAIR makes to consist of Messrs Wolcott, Bradley, and Belamy. 
          
          

          
            CITY POWERS AND RIGHTS.

              prescribing their powers and rights, and the manner in which they shall exercise the
              same; and to regulate such other matters as property pertain thereto," approved
              March 14, 1867, and declaring an emergency, coming up in regular or s"-

            Mr BRADLEY hoped the Senate would refuse to concur. The amendments have no reference
              to the object of the bill, He moved to non-concur.

            The motion was agreed to.

            Mr. Cave's bill [S. 240] or the incorporations of societies for the study of
              Denistry was read the second time.

            Mr STEIN saw no specific object in the bill, but there were dangerous powers in -
              among others, the right of holding property to an unlimited extent

              Corporations

            The following described Senate bills were read the second time and severally ordered

              respects The University has purchased some cheap swamp lands which [?] reclaiming - they will increase is value &c

            Mr. ROBINSON, of Decatur, had heard something in regard to this matter which causes
              him to be suspicious of the demands this institution makes. 

            

            Mr BRADLEY spoke in favor of the bill. 

            Mr. FISHER said it looked to him like it was a proposition to incorporate a land
              speculation.

            Mr. WOLCOTT urged considerations favorable to the bill

            On motion of Mr. ROBINSON of Decatur, it was referred to the Committee on
                Corporations.

            The Senate adjourned till 9 o'clock tomorrow. 
          
          

        
        

        
          HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.

          The House met at 9 o'clock A M.

          On motion of Mr VATER Mr. Stewart, of Rush, was called to the chair: and the journal of
            yesterday was read, corrected and approved

          The SPEAKER resumed the Chair, and announced the order of 

          
            PETITIONS

            Mr. VATER presented a "demand" for a change of the law in relation to the
              pay of certain county officers

            Mr HIGBEE and Mr WILE presented petitions on the subject of Homeopathic College

            Mr WELBORN presented a petition on temperance

            Mr. STANTON presented two claims. 
          
          

          
            REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.

            Mr. OSBORN, from the Special Committee on Employes, submitted a
              report in that matter, continuing the same force that was required for the regular
              session with an additional messenger for the Door keeper

            Mr DITTEMORE proposed to amend by striking out "two firement" and inserting
              "one," which was laid on the table and the report was concurred in

            Mr LONG, from the special committee on stationery, reported an allowance of $15 to
              each member for stationery - including postage stamps - and the same allowance as
              heretofore for newspapers; two copies of the statues; and $5 for stamps for each of
              the two principal Clerks.

            Mr. CARNAHAN proposed $10 each for stationery, &c.

            Mr VATER proposed $5, which was laid on the table.

            Mr. WELBORN As this is but a continuation of the business of the regular session,
              proposed to strike out from the report all that relates to stamps and stationery,
              which was laid on the table - yeas, 57, nays - 29

            Mr. PIERCE, of Vigo, proposed to strike out all in relation to newspapers, and insert
              "one copy each of the Indianapolis JOURNAL and the
              Indianapolis Sentinel," unwrapped and unstamped.

            He gave reasons for this amendment - the chief, on account of irregularity in the
              mails

            Mr. HYATT proposed to amend the amendment, by saving "Three copies of the JOURNAL and Sentinel - two of each to be wrapped and
              stamped," which was laid on the table.

            Mr. McFADIN supported Mr. Pierce's amendement.

            Mr VATER proposed to amend the amendment by giving each member two papers daily as he
              may select for himself, which was laid on the table.

            Mr DITTEMORE proposed to amend the amendment by striking it out; which was laid on
              the table.

            And then, under the force of the previous question, Mr Pierce's amendment was
              agreed to.

            Mr. OSBORNE made an ineffectual motion [?] the
                Evening Mirror.

            Mr RATLIFF submitted the following:

            Resolved, That each member be required to close up his stationery
              account with the Librarian within five days.

            Which was objected to, and ruled out of order, because resolutions are not now in
              order.

            Mr. COFFROTH moved that the Doorkeepr be required to procure one copy for each member
              of the Daily Telegraph and sic copies of the Volksblatt

            Mr PIERCE, of Porter, proposed to add six copies of the weekly Zukunft
              [?]

            On motion of Mr BARRETT, it was laid on the table - yeas 51 nays 37.

            And then the report as amended was adopted, and a motion to reconsider was laid on
              the table.

            Mr OSBORN said we can no longer look to the committees of the last session for
              reports, and it became the House to act on the alleged frauds and enormities in the
              management of the prisons, and the Governor's recommendations in regard to this
              matter, with special earnestness and [promptitude?]

            Mr BARRITT said the former committee were ready to report. Their report was ready now
              to be submitted, and be alleged that the committee has probed these matters to the
              bottom. 
          
          

          
            RESOLUTIONS - MANAGEMENT OF THE PRISONS.

            Mr. HAMILTON submitted the following:

            
              
                
                  Resolved, That a Special Committee on Prisons be appointed by
                    the Speaker, whose duty it shall be to inquire into the manner in which the
                    management of the prisons have been carried on - to report as soon as
                    possible.
                
              
            

            He gave reason for the proposition.

            Mr. STEWARD, of Ohio, supported the resolution, on the ground of the popular demand
              for investigation. 

            

             Mr. WELBORN thought it premature; proposing to await the investigations and reports
              of the Standing Committees, whose examinations, he understood, were very through.

            Mr. STEWART, of Rush, also considered that the matter was premature. He would not
              multiply committees till we found a pressing occasion to do so.

            Mr. RUDDELL said, while it was the desire of the former committee to report earlier,
              it became impossible for them to do so. Inf fact, the committee was ready to report,
              and he failed to obtain leave to submit it, on the third of March. He said the feeling
              of some officers in the management of the prison toward the committee was not the most
              pleasant, which was accounted for by the searching nature of the investigation by the
              committee. He said that a new investigation could but corroborate the existing report,
              adding that the extra expense of the existing report is not far from $200

            Mr. WILDMAN desired the consent of the House to hear the report of the old committee,
              but was not unwilling to appoint another special committee.

            Mr. VATER moved to postpone the consideration of the resolution one week.

            Mr PIERCE, of Vigo, held that the former committees report could not be received. And
              he stated that, perhaps, with effort to get at the bottom of the matter, they went a
              little below the bottom. It had been insinuated that they have not heard all the
              testimony and that they heard some that is improper. He simply wanted a new committee,
              against whom could be laid no charge of unfairness.

            Mr. ZOLLARS said these insinuations of unfairness must have come from interested and
              implicated parties. He would not discard the former committee not their report, being
              of the opinion, that, instead of being over thorough, that the reports is not thorough
              enough.

            Mr. MILES moved to lay the resolution on the table, and the motion was agreed to -

                Committee,) the following 
          

          
            STANDING COMMITTEE ON STATE PRISONS.

            Messrs. Ruddell, Lamporn, Barritt, Hamilton, Monroe, Davis of Elkhart, and Cory. 
          
          

          
            MANAGEMENT AND CONDITION OF THE PRISONS.

            Mr. RUDDELL, from the Prison's Committee, in compliance with the resolution of
              the House adopted this morning, submitted an elaborate report of their investigations
              of the condition and management of the State Prisons ad Jeffersonville and Michigan
              City, embracing charges preferred by Colonel Meredith against officials in the
              management of the prison South, at Jeffersonville; which was read by the Clerk.

            Mr RUDDELL made explanatory statements, showing the reasons for the delay of the
              report, and in behalf of the Committee he submitted a preamble and a resolution, which
              was adopted, as follows:

            
              
                

                  WHEREAS, The Senate and the House sub committee on the
                    Affairs of the State Prisons, in their investigations of the charges against
                    certain Directors of the State Prison South, made that investigation jointly and
                    had but one copy of the evidence prepared, believing that to be sufficient for
                    the use of both committees, which copy was submitted by the Chairman of the
                    Senate Committee, together with his report to the Senate; and,

                  WHEREAS, The Senate refused to allow the said copy to be
                    withdrawn for the use of the House committee; therefore,

                  Resolved, That the Senate be requested to furnish a copy of
                    the evidence to this House. 
                
              
            

            

            Mr. RATLIFF moved that the report of the Committee on Prisons be
              laid on the table for the present, which was agreed to.

            After further examination by Mr. HAMILTON and Mr. OSBORN - 

            Mr. RUDDELL submitted a written explaination and report to the Governor from the
              Directors of the Southern Prison, dated April 6, 1869, which was read for the
              information of the House.

            Mr. OSBORN said as this paper set forth what pertains to the old Warden, and the
              report respects the Directors, the matters against the old Warden, he supposed, did
              not come to light till the coming in of the new Warden

            Mr RUDDELL and Mr. PIERCE of Vigo, assented to this. Mr. Ruddell stating that this
              latter paper presented by him was a document accompanying the Governor's
              message

            The House refused to lay the document on the table and it was referred to the
                Committee on Prisons.

            STATE DEBT FUND COEMISSIONERS

            The bill [S. 231] to amend section two of an

            ADDITIONAL UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURTS.

            The joint resolution [S. 9] creating another District Court of the United States in
              the Southern District of Indiana, was taken up.

            It proposes Congressional instructions to secure such Southern District. And Mr.
              McFadin's amendment thereto (which was adopted) proposes to include a Norther
              District - the court to be located at Logansport.

            Mr WELBORN said his motion to reconsider the adoption of Mr. McFadin's amendment
              was duly filed during the regular session, and he moved now to take up that motion to
              reconsider.

            And, accordingly, the motion to reconsider was taken up

            Mr. McFADIN was heard in favor of his amendment, showing that the same demand, and
              the same necessity exists for the Northern and for a Southern District Court of the
              United States.

            Mr. WELBORN replied, showing the superiority of the claims of the southern portion of
              the State - Evansville being the second city of the State as to population and the
              first as to commercial importance And, by a decision of the Supreme Court of the
              United States, no case connected with the local civil court; but they must all come up
              to the United States District Court at Indianapolis. These numerous wrongs were
              suffered on account of the expense of coming here with cases involving claims of
              smaller amounts. It required a cause of action for
              $500 to pay for coming up here with it. And he was satisfied that Congress would pay
              no attention to our application for two additional United States District Courts for
              the State Of Indiana And this was the only thing be asked or expected for the Southern
              portion of the State looking to an advantage on account of State or National patronage
              And he deprecated the unreasonable hostility which had defeated former applications
              for this Southern District Court.

            Mr. McFADEN spoke again, sustaining his amendment, criticising the superior claims of
              Evansville.

            The question on the motion to reconsider, was decided in the negative 40 to 46. So
              the House refused to reconsider

            The question being on the final passage of the joint resolution-

            Mr. STANTON disclaimed any knowledge of an controlling influence hostile to
              Evansville, or to a Southern District Court, intimated by Mr. Welborn.

            Mr WELBORN was willing now to vote for another United States District Court for
              Richmond, tor the east, and Terre Haute, or wheresoever, for the west portion of the
              State

            Mr NEFF considered the amendment equivalent to a defeat of the proposition, and he
              should now vote against it.

            On motion of Mr BAILIFF, it was laid on the table. Affirmative 41, negative 28

            0n motion of Mr. OSBORN, the order of business was suspended for the call of the
              names of members for the introduction of bills

            Mr. BAKER, (for Mr. Underwood) introduced a bill [H.
                R. 321] for an act to amend the act authorizing the authorities of cities and
              towns to sell bonds for the erection and repairs of School houses, &c.

            Mr. UNDERWOOD had explained that the object of his bill was to authorize the proper
              authorities of cities and towns "to purchase" school houses, as well as to
              build them. Is was referred to the Committee on Education

            Mr. BARNET introduced a bill [H. R. 322] to enable railroad companies who have formed
              articles of association to perfect their lines by connections, to preserve their
              franchises, &c.

            It was referred to the special Committee on Railroads.

            The House then adjourned. 
          
          
          
          
        
        

        
          IN SENATE.
          
            THURSDAY, April 15,1869.
          

          The Senate met at 9 o'clock A. M.

          The Secretary's minutes of yesterday's proceedings were read. 

          
            RULES AND ORDERS

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR announced the first thing in order to be the consideration of
              the resolutions offered yesterday, looking to a change in the order of business in the
              Senate each day.

            Mr. STEIN moved the adoption of the resolution permitted by him.

            Mr. FISHER preferred the regular order.

            Mr. STEIN stated his object to be to dispose of the most important bills first the
              bills that have been selected by Senators from among the two or three hundred before
              them

            Mr BELLAMY suggested objections to the resolution.

            The adoption of the resolution was favored by Messrs. Robinson, of Decatur, and
              Gray.

            Mr HOOPER offered his resolution on yesterday for the very purpose of getting rid of
              this special calendar referred to in the resolution. He desired the Senate to proceed
              in the regular way.

            Mr. GIFFORD moved to amend by way way of substitute so as to provide that bills shall
              be disposed of: first, in the order in which they are introduced; second, in the order
              in which they are reported from the committees; and third, in the order in which they
              are ordered engrossed.

            Mr. STEIN regarded the substitute as out, of order, because the resolution provides
              for a temporary change, while the substitute proposes a permanent one.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR held that the substitute would have to lay on the table for
              one day.

            Mr HUMPHREYS made an ineffectual motion to lay the whole subject on the table.

            Mr. LEE spoke in favor of the resolution, because it gave the more modest members a
              better chance to forward their private bills.

            Mr. HOOPER moved to lay the resolution on the table.

            The motion was agreed to, by yeas 22, nays 18.

            Mr. HOOPER moved the adoption of His resolution offered yesterday.

            Mr. JOHNSON of Spencer, made an ineffectual motion to lay the resolution on the
              table.

            The resolution was then adopted. 
          
          

          
            PETITIONS, MEMORIALS, &C.

            Mr. CAVEN presented a claim, which was referred to the Committee on Claims.

            Also, a memorial in reference to the location of the Agricultural College proposing
              that if the Agricultural College shall be located on the grounds of the Northwestern
              Christian University, the 
              S a e shall have the right to use
              the College buildings which is worth with its surroundings about $266 000 The
              donations from the county of Marion ($100 000), amounting to enough more to erect
              other buildings if necessary.

            It lays on the table for the present.

            Also, a memorial in reference to regulating the practice of medicine, which was
              referred to the Special Committee on Medical Legislation. 
          
          

          
            REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.

            Mr GRAY from the Committee on Corporations, returned the Levee and
              Drain bill, S 134 with lengthy amendments; in the nature of a substitute-striking out
              from the enacting clause and inserting in lieu new matter.

            The amendment was agreed to, and ordered engrossed.

            Bills were returned from Committees with favorable reports thereon, viz: H. R. 138,
              161 122 and 113 with amendments; 5 and 11 with an amendment proposed by the majority by
              way of a substitute, striking out from the enacting clause. The minority of the
              Committee reported different matter by way of substitute for the Court bill H. R. 11. 
          
          

          
            THE UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE AMENDMENT.

            Mr. FISHER, observing a little nervousness on the part of the Democratic members on
              the subject embedded in the Governor's message of March 1, and in order that
              their fears may be put at rest, offered the following:

            
              
                
                  
                    Resolved, That the consideration of the message of his
                    Excellency the Governor, sent to the Senate of the first day of March last, on
                    the subject of the Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States
                    be postponed till Tuesday, the 11th day of May next and made the special order
                    for that day.
                
              
            

            The resolution was adopted.

            Mr. HANNA moved to reconsider the vote adopting the resolution.

            Mr. FISHER moved to lay the motion on the table.

            The latter motion was agreed to. 
          
          

          
            ADDITIONAL COMMITTEEMEN,

            Mr. ARMSTRONG offered the following:

            
              
                
                  
                    Resolved, That owing to the protracted and serious illness of
                    Senator Colley, and his inability to meet with us on account of his illness,
                    that the President of the Senate add an additional member to each of the
                    standing committees where the name of Mr Colley appears.
                
              
            

            The resolution was adopted.

            Subsequently the LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR announced as additional members: On the
                Committee on Printing, Mr. Fosdick; on Public
                Buildings, Mr. Gray; On Phraseology, Mr. Bellamy;
                on County and Township Business, Mr Armstrong on Legislative

            NEW PROPOSITIONS.

            WORK FOR COMMITTEES.

            The following numbered Senate bills (introduced yesterday) were read by title only

              317, and 318 
          
          

          
            BILLS READ THE SECOND TIME.

            The bills (introduced yesterday) S. 308 and S. 309 were read the second time and
              ordered engrossed for the third reading.

            And then the Senate took a recess til 2 o'clock 
          
          

          
            AFTERNOON SESSION

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR announced that bills on their third reading were the order of
              business. 
          

          
            BIENNIAL ELECTIONS

             Mr. GRAY, regarding the election bill as the most important now pending, moved to
              suspend the order of business and take up the bill H. R. 23, to change the time of
              holding elections in this State and to fill all vacancies occasioned by the provisions
              of this bill. 

            The motion was agreed to

            Accordingly the bill, H. R. 23, was read the
              third time

            Mr. GIFFORD thought the bill placed too much power in the hands of Governor -
              allowing him to appoint County Commissioners and Justices of the Peace for sometime to
              come

            Mr. HANNA, as so far as he was personally concerned, had no objections to the bill
              provided it be well guarded. He preferred to see it referred to some committee, and
              would like to see its operations put off, if it must be passed, at least till the
              first of January. He insisted that it should be well considered and carefully
              guarded

            Mr BELLAMY If the law goes into immediate effect it will save the expense of an
              election next fall to fill vacancies that will then occur in many petty officers, and
              which vacancies could be filled without expense by gubernatorial appointment. In the
              face of the many petitions that have come up here for a measure of this kind, he could
              not vote against the bill. 

            Mr. FISHER read from the Constitution of the State to show that all officers except
              members of the Legislature held till their places shall be filled according to law -
              till their successors shall be elected and qualified

            Mr. BRADLEY. The term of office of county commissioners must be changed (which can
              not be done under the Constitution), or there will be a vacancy every two years in
              that office in every county. This law in effect extends the term of office of county
              commisioner four years. 

            Mr JOHNSON, of Montgomery, moved to recommit the bill with instructions to strike out
              the emergency clause and insert in lieu a provision that it shall take effect June 1
              1870

            Mr. GRAY insisted that this bill would save the State about $150 000 every 3d year.
              We have too many elections now - they occur to often - and this he believed to be the
              opinion of ninety-nine out of every one hundred voters in the State of Indiana. He
              hoped the motion to recommit would fail for he regarded its adoption as a virtual
              defeat of the bill - it is not probably that it could go back to the House and be
              returned here in time to be finally passed by the Senate. 

            Mr. GREEN saw no inconsistency in the bill. 

            Mr. HUMPHREYS There is no necessity for this law going into effect till the fall of
              1870, and with such an amendment he would vote for it and guaranteed that every member
              of his party in the Senate would do the same. And if we are sincere in deferring to
              the people, such an amendment will be made Unless it is, he should vote against the
              bill. 

            Mr GIFFORD would favor the bill if the time for taking effect thereof be put off till
              the first of January 1870. We should not be in such a desperate hurry to change the
              statue on this subject

            Mr BELLAMY moved to lay the motion to recommit on the table.

            The motion was agreed to by yeas 25, nays 14, as follows:

            
              
                
                  YEAS - Messrs. Andrews, Armstrong, Beardsey, Bellamy, Case,
                    Caven, Church, Cravens, Fisher, Fosdick, Gray, Green, Hadley, Hamilton, Hess,
                    Hooper, Jaquess, Johnson of Spencer, Kinley, Reynold, Robinson of Decatur,
                    Scott, Stein, Wolcott and Wood - 25.

                  NAYS - Messrs Bradley, Carson, Gifford, Hana, Huey, Hoffman,
                    Humphrey, Johnson of Montgomery, Lee, Montgomery, Morgan, Sherrod, Taggart, and
                    Turner - 14. 
                
              
            

            

            Mr HANNA moved to recommit the bill to the Committee on Elections, with instructions
              to amend so the act shall take effect on the first day of January, 1870 He made the
              point that the Constitution, in speaking of vacancies, only has reference to the
              offices mentioned in that instrument In the respect the bill is not well guarded; and
              though it is predetermined that the bill shall pass, he urged again and again that
              such amendments should be made to it as will well and carefully guard its provisions
              especially as this is a measure which takes authority out of the hands of the
              people.

            Mr. CRAVENS. The more frequently you can bring the people near to their
              representatives, the better it is for the country He was inclined to oppose the bill
              on principle; but believing the people favored such a change, he should vote for it.
              He would infinitely prefer annual elections and annual sessions of the Legislature.
              The bill is guarded about as well as bills gen really are, but as it is manifest that
              it cannot pass this afternoon, he suggested that it be made the special order for some
              future day.

             Mr. GRAY moved to lay the motion to recommit on the table.

            This motion was agreed to, by yeas 25, nays 14

            On motion by Mr GRAY this bill was made the special order for next Tuesday at 2
              o'clock, 
          
          

          
            JUDGES SALARIES.

            Mr. Scott's bill [S. 45] relating to the salaries of the Supreme, Circuit, Civil
              and Criminal Circuit and Common Pleas Judges and declaring an emergency, coming
              up-

            Mr. BRADLEY moved to reconsider the vote adopting the the amendments fixing the
              salaries at $3 500 and $2 500. He desired the salaries should remain as in the bill
              $4,000 and $3,000.

            Mr. BELLAMY made the point that the bill having been read the third time could not be
              amended now

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR decided the motion out of order.

            Mr. CHURCH moved to recommit to the Committee on Fees and Salaries, with instructions
              to fix Prosecuting Attorneys' salaries at $1,000

            The motion was rejected

            On motion by Mr. BRADLEY the vote ordering the bill engrossed was reconsidered; and,
              on his further motion the vote adopting the amendment was reconsidered

            Mr. HANNA favored increase of salaries of ail Judges and of Prosecuting
              Attorneys.

            The question recurring on the amendment striking out '$4 000" and inserting
              "$3 500" for Supreme Judges, and striking out '$3 000,"
              substituting "$2 200" for Circuit Judges-

            It was agreed to by yeas 21, nays 17.

            Mr GREEN moved to increase the salary of Common Pleas Judges from $2,000 to $2
              500,

            Mr BRADLEY moved to lay the bill and pending amendments on the table.

            The motion was rejected, by yeas, 14; nays 25

            Mr CHURCH renewed his motion to refer the bill to the Committee on Fees and
                Salaries with instructions to fix the salary of Circuit Court Prosecuting
              Attorney at $1 000, payable quarterly.

            Some discussion here took place on points of order, when-

            On motion by Mr. TURNER, the vote passing the bill to the third reading was
              reconsidered

            Mr. CHURCH now pressed his amendment.

            It was rejected by yeas, 17; noes, 23.

            Mr. GREEN moved to make the salary of the Common Pleas Judge $2 500.

            Mr. ANDREWS would be as willing as any one to raise salaries at a proper time, but
              now, while the people are crying for retrenchment and reform, we should give heed, And
              he opposed adding a single dollar to the salary of judges as long: as we are burdened
              by the present incomplete and faulty judicial system

            Mr. BRADLEY moved to amend by increasing the salary of Supreme Judges to $3,950;
              Circuit Judges to $2 975; Common Pleas Judges to $2400; Circuit Prosecutors to $900,
              and Common Pleas Prosecutors to $500

            Mr CARSON moved to lay the amendment on the table.

            The motion was rejected by yeas 19, nays 21

            A division being demanded Mr. GREEN argued in favor of increasing the salaries of the
              Supreme Judges. If the present judges were paid in proportion fothe salary received in
              the time of Judge Blackford, they should get about $6,000 or $7 000 per annum.

            Mr TURNER favored an increase of salary because the present pay will not command the
              talent and learning that is desirable. As between the two classes of Judges he should
              prefer to see the Circuit Judges salaries increased, but he favored an increase of
              them all. He also much desired to see the present judicial system reorganized and
              suggested improvements that should be made.

            Mr. BRADLEY also thought it more necessary, as between the two, to raise the salary
              of the Circuit rather than the Supreme Judges.

            

            Mr. SHERROD. This question does not admit of discussion when it is remembered that
              both of the great political parties in the late canvass were pledged to retrenchment
              and reform He protested against such measures at this time

            Mr ARMSTRONG moved to strike from $3 950 the figure "9' and insert
              "0"

            Mr. HANNA spoke at length in favor of raising all these salaries or none of them, and
              against making flesh of one class and fish of another.

            Mr. KINLEY moved that the bill lay on the table, with a view of offering a resolution
              that the Committee on Organization of Courts be instructed to
              report a bill reorganizing the judicial system of the State, etc.

            The amendment was rejected by yeas 17, nays 22. 

            The amendment (Mr. Armstrong') was rejected by yeas 14, nays 25

            The amendment making the salary of the Supreme Judges $3 950 - being the first
              division of Mr. Bradley's amendment - was rejected by yeas 16, ans 24

            The second and third divisions of the amendment was also rejected

            The fourth division, referring to an increase of the Prosecuter's salary, was
              also rejected

            Mr HANNA moved to amend by making the salary of the Prosecuting Attorney of the
              Circuit Court $800, payable quarterly

            It was agreed to on a division - affirmative 17, negative 14

            Mr HADLEY moved to increase the Common Pleas Prosecuters' salary to $500

            The amendment was agreed to; and then -

            The bill was ordered engrossed for the third reading. 
          
          

          
            EMPLOYES - REDUCTION.

             Mr. GIFFORD from the Committee on Employes of the Senate,
              reported in favor of limiting the employes, to wit: for the Principal Secretary, seven
              assistants' Assistant Secretary, three assistants; for the Doorkeeper, six
              assistants and two pages

            After debate -

             The report was concurred in.

            On motion by Mr STEIN it was - 

            
              Ordered, That when the Senate adjourn it adjourns till 9
              o'clock tomorrow. 
          
          

          
            RELEASE OF SURETIES.

            Mr. Green's bill [S. 20], to tax costs in cases where surety in the bonds of and
              guardian, executor or administrator shall apply to be released as said surety. [If
              surety shows good cause the principal pays costs, otherwise the cost is taxed against
              the applicant]

            On motion of Mr SHERROD the bill was laid on the table.

            And then the Senate adjourned till 9 o'clock to morrow. 
          
          

          
            THE STATE PRISON SOUTH.

            Mr. RUDDELL submitted the following report at the opening of yesterday
              afternoon's session: see pages 55 and 56 of these Reports.

            
              
                
                  

                  
                    MR. SPEAKER: 
                  The Committee on the Affairs of State Prisons, to whom was
                    referred that portion of the Governor's Message relating to said prisons,
                    the reports of the Directors, and accompanying documents, and to whom was
                    assigned the duty of visiting said prisons, and personally examining the same,
                    the books and accounts of the officers, and all other matters pertaining
                    thereto, beg leave to submit the following report:

                  1 As to the affairs of the State Prison South. The committee have visited said
                    prison, and made a careful and minute examination of the same. They find the
                    buildings, or so much thereof as comprise the cell-house, are old, and
                    constructed seemingly with a view to rendering confinement therein, of itself,
                    an insufferable punishment, so little regard to being paid in the original plan
                    of construction to light or ventilation At the suggestion of the visiting
                    committee of the last General Assembly, and in pursuance of instructions from
                    the Directors, the late Warden devised and executed a plan by which air is
                    admitted to the cell apartments through large pipes at the bottom o and
                    extending through the walls, which makes the condition of the inmates much more
                    tolerable than before. But there is still no means of escape for the vitiated
                    air from the cells, except through the door. This compels a liberal and constant
                    use of disinfectants in the surrounding halls. It is to be hoped the Directors
                    and Warden may fall upon some plan for the better ventilation of these
                    apartments. 

                  There are 344 cells in the male department, and sixteen in the female, making
                    in all 360 There were, December 15, 1868, 405 convicts in the prison. While the
                    committee believe, with the Directors, that there is ample shop room now in the
                    institution for the profitable employment of 600 convicts, they do not believe
                    the cell room sufficient for so great a number. 

                  The committee find the workshops capacious and conveniently arranged, as well
                    for the health and comfort of the convicts as for their employment in the most
                    profitable manner in the various manufactures which the contractors have
                    introduced and are now successfully operating.
                  

                  The committee saw the prisoners at work and could see no good reason why their
                    labor should be so cheaply rated; but on the contrary, think with, good
                    discipline, it might be advanced 50, if not 100 per cent, above what it now
                    commands.

                  The prisoners are tasked according to their capacity Any one able and willing
                    to do more than his task, is allowed for his overwork at the same rate which is
                    paid to the State. At first though, this system would seem to be just, and
                    indeed would seem to afford an incentive to the convict to make effort to
                    ameliorate his own condition in some measure by providing himself with such
                    little comfort and luxuries as could be procured with the proceeds of his
                    over-work. But after conversing with the convicts, and with gentlemen
                    experienced in prison discipline, and after a careful investigation of the
                    subject the committee are driven to the conclusion that it any task should be
                    imposed, it should be one uniform task for all, but they think any task system
                    productive of discontent, and destructive of discipline The committee would
                    recommend that, on con[ ] of the advance in
                    price of 5 cents per day for each man employed by contractors, the task system
                    be abolished, and the convicts worked from bell to bell; that no contractor
                    allowed to give tobacco or anything else, to convicts; and that each convict, at
                    the expiration of each week, on showing a good record for deportment, be allowed
                    50 cents by the Warden out of the proceeds of the prison 0 the same to be
                    forfeited for bad conduct, and to go into the State Treasury. The prisoners are
                    well supplied with good and wholesome food, and are well clothed.

                  The Committee were well pleased with the condition of the hospital and its
                    appointments - better, perhaps, than with any other part of the institution;
                    which fact, together with the small number of patients - six, and they
                    convalescent - speak in such terms of commendation of the physician as to render
                    any further mention from the Committee unnecessary The Committee paid their
                    respects to the Chaplain, whose sympathies are fully enlisted in the important
                    work in which he is engaged; and no better evidence need be given that he
                    practices the Christian virtues which he recommends to those committed to his
                    charge, than the patience and forbearance displayed while exhibiting to the
                    Committee would most earnestly urge the appropriation of at least $1 000 to the
                    State Prison South, for library purposes.

                  This amount though a mere pittance will give temporary relief, and will form a
                    nucleus around which it is to be hoped may be gathered the proceeds of annual
                    appropriations until a library sufficient for the purpose, and creditable to the
                    State, shall be provided.

                  Financially, the State Prison South has not yet proven a success. The Directors
                    and Warden have made an effort to make it self-sustaining. They have reduced the
                    expenses considerably, and are deserving of credit accordingly So eager have
                    they been to places the prison on an independent footing that they represent in
                    their report that they have at last reached the goal of prison management, and
                    proclaim the institution a little more than self-sustaining. But the Committee
                    can not get the same result from the same figures.

                  
                    
                      By reference to the Clerk's statement o[] the amount of assets over
                        and above liabilities 15th December, 1867 the amount is found to

                      This, however, does not show the entire deficit it will be remembered
                        that on the 5th page of the Report of the Prison South there is a statement
                        of bill's endorsed since the close of the fiscal year - but which

                  This exhibit is by no means encouraging, and in fact was absolutely startling
                    to the Committee, and in no wise area they aple to account for it, save on the
                    ground of extravagance in purchases of provisions, medical stores, etc., and the
                    seemingly unrestricted license given the Warden under the head of perquisites. 

                  For the instance under the latter head:

                  1. The Warden has, under sanction of custom it is said, boarded a number of
                    guards, furnishing his table in a large measure from provisions belonging to the
                    prison. 

                  2. The gas used for the illumination of 
                    the Warden's mansion, and perhaps in some cases the fuel necessary for the
                    heating of the same. 

                  3 The keeping of a number of horse and cows at the expense of the State

                  4 The services of convicts about the Warden's house and stable as
                    servants: usually two men and there women

                  5 The [?] from the prison sufficient to fat
                    from twenty five to one hundred hogs per year. 

                  These items, when considered separately, are by no means inconsiderabe or
                    insignificant; but when summed up it will be not be difficult to account for a
                    large portion of the deficit shown in the prison account. The law does not allow
                    any perquisites to any prison officers. And in this connection the Committee
                    will state that they have submitted an amendment to House bill 217, which, if
                    adopted, will prevent this reckless quandering of the State means, and if
                    strictly enforced, will make the State Prisons not only self sustaining but, as
                    claimed by the friends of the bill will make them a source of revenue to the
                    State.

                  Very grave charges were presented to the Committee against officers and guards
                    formerly in charge of the prison, of drunkenness and treatment of prisoners,
                    prostitution of female convicts and demoralization generally. Although the
                    parties charged were no longer connected with the institution, and were beyond
                    removal, or impeachment, yet the Committee, to satisfy themselves in regard to
                    these alleged abuses and outrages upon humanity, law and order, caused witnesses
                    to be brought before them to testify concerning the som Loth as the Committee
                    were to believe, the evidence compelled the conviction that many of these
                    charges were true, though not to the extent alleged in the exaggerated report
                    which has found its way into the newspapers There is no proof in evidence
                    justifying the statement that convicts have died from the effects of whipping
                    That cruel punishment have been inflicted there is no doubt. The Committee most
                    earnestly commend to the favorable consideration of the House the proposition
                    urged by the Governor, and by the people, for the erection of separate buildings
                    suitable for the imprisonment of females Justice, humanity, and the higher
                    sentiments of our civilization demand that this be done. 

                  The Committee would take this opportunity to make honorable mention of Colonel
                    Shuler, the present Warden. The wonderful change wrought in the short space of a
                    few weeks in the general morale of all confined in or connected with the
                    prisons; the universal expression of satisfaction of both convicts and
                    contractors; the entire absence of complaint, and the greatly improved
                    discipline and order manifest in every department, mark him as a man
                    preeminently fitted for the place. 

                  The Committee will now call attention to the condition of affairs of the State
                    Prison North They found this prison in splendid condition No time need be
                    occupied in speaking of the buildings and their admirable appointments. The
                    convcits were in good health, well fed, well clothed, and as cheerful as men
                    could be expected to be in a penitentiary. 

                  The Warden is an able and efficient officer The Directors have evidently looked
                    after the interests of the State more sharply than has heretofore been the
                    custom of prison directors; but the Committee must make the same suggestion to
                    the Directors North as has already been made to the those South, viz: That the
                    law contemplates no perquisites of any description whatever to any [?]. The practice of appropriating the [?], using State property for private purposes (to
                    wit: occupation of house belonging to the State by a guard and using it as a
                    boarding house for other guards without paying the State rent therefor,) &c,
                    &c, prevail at the Prison North as well the Prison South. 

                  The prison has no library, and needs an appropriation therefor. On return of
                    the Committee from the Prison North, a communication was found in waiting from
                    Colonel J B Merriwether, of Jeffersonville, making some charges against F M
                    Meredith and M P Ghee, Directors of the State Prison South - charges new to the
                    Committee - not having been presented during their visit to said prison A
                      cer[?] that the Senate Committee were at
                    Prison South, it was thought advisable to await their return. Immediately on the
                    return of the Senate Committee, a resolution was introduced in each house
                    authorizing a sub-committee from each to revisit the prison and investigate
                    further into the affairs of the same. 

                  The House sub-committee, Messrs. Davis, Field and Cory, being unable to go at
                    the time fixed by the Senate Committee, the chairman of the House Committee and
                    Mr B F Williams, of the House, at the request of the chairman, accompanied the
                    Senate Committee. They [ ] of the Directors at Jeffersonville, Mr Ferrier,
                    Director of last year, and Mr Meredith and has attorney. The Committees found
                    the charges as set fourth in Col Merriwether's testimony, were
                    substantially as follows:

                  1 That said F M Meredith and M P Ghee, while Directors of the State Prison
                    South, did demand of and receive from 
                    Colonel J B Merriwether various amounts at various times, amounting in all $750
                    each, for the privilege of being retained as Warden in said prison. 

                  2 That said Meredith and Ghee received from contractors various amounts of
                    money for the exercise of their official authority. 

                  3 That the said F M Meredith, while Director of said prison, did engage himself
                    to one John T. Mathews, a convict in said prison, to procure a pardon for said
                    Mathews, for and in consideration of a fee stipulated to be paid him (Meredith)
                    by said John L Mathews. 

                  The Committees caused a number of witnesses to be brought before them to
                    testify to the above charges, and allowed the Directors and opportunity to be
                    heard in their defense. After carefully weighing all the evidence, and listening
                    to the argument of the attorney for the defense, the two Committees were
                    unanimous in the opinion that the charges were, in the main, sustained by the
                    evidence, which is herewith submitted; and the Committee are therefore unanimous
                    in the opinion that said F M Meredith and M P Ghee ought to be removed for
                    misdemeanors committed in office.

            REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.

             Mr. PIERCE, of Porter, from the Committee on Benevolent
                Institutions, returned the bill No. 163, with clerical amendments.

            Mr. HUTCHINGS from the special committee thereon, returned the bill [S. 292] to
              transfer Brown county from the First to the Second Judicial Circuit, recommending its
              indefinite postponement. 

            Mr. LONG, for the minority of said committee, moved that the report be not concurred
              in. 

            Mr WILSON supported the motion to [non?] concur. 

            Mr OVERMYER, seeing a political influence in this effort to suppress the Senate bill,
              hoped the report would not be concurred in. 

            Mr. BARRITT said the committee were unanimous in this report - excepting only Mr
              Long. The bill gave too much labor to Judge Bicknell.

            Mr. STEWART, of Rush, said that this Senate bill 292 is so connected the bill [S 290]
              that they should both be passed together. The passage of these bills was more than a
              matter of convenience - it was a matter of necessity. 

            Mr. JOHNSON, of Parke, moved to refer the report to the Committee on the
                organization of Courts. 

            

             Mr. BARRETT made an ineffectual motion to lay the motion on the table.

            Mr. JOHNSON then withdrew his motion. 

            Mr. McFADIN took the general position that this master belongs to the Committee on
              the organization of Courts. We might as well undertake here to form new Representative
              districts as to be creating new Judicial Districts or tampering with old ones.

            Mr ZENOR considered that to pass this bill would be to do injustice to Judge
              Bicknell, of his district, even if he has himself consented to it This judge has
              already as much to do as any judge in the State

            Mr. LONG replied that the bill would work no injury or injustice to the Second
              Circuit Judge Bicknell having consented - the wish and will of the people of Brown
              county ought alone to be consulted

            Mr. BATES gave the reasons which guided the committee in making the report

            Mr WILLIAMS, of Knox, saw in this bill a step preliminary to the creation of a new
              Criminal Circuit. Those who represent the interests of the tax payers should look to
              these things.

            Mr. OVERMYER demanded the previous question, and, under its pressure, the report was
              rejected - affirmative 46, negative 35.

            Mr. LONG moved to suspend the constitutional restriction so as to admit of the
              passage of bill S 292 today.

            Mr STEWART, of Rush, moved that bill [S. 290]
              also have the benefit of the proposed dispensation. 

            Mr LONG accepted

            Messrs. ZENOR, WILDMAN and OSBORN desired to include other bills

            Mr. CORY opposed, and Mr LONG withdraw his motion, and the bill S. 292 goes to the
              files.

              0. 
          
          

          
            THOMAS C M'COUN -
              DOORKEEPER

             Mr. OVERMYER submitted the following:

            WHEREAS, Certain reports are now notorious among the members of the House, charging
              the present Doorkeeper of this House, Thus, C McCoun with corruption in office;

            And whereas, written statements charging corrupt on upon the aforesaid McCoun signed
              by responsible parties making the charges, have been presented to the members of his
              body and are no in the possession of a member: therefor - 

            Resolved, That a committee of five be appointed by the Speaker to investigate said
              charges, and report as soon as possible to this House; that said committee shall have
              power to send for persons and papers, and all powers necessary to conduct the
              investigation Provided that the charges against the said McCoun shall be set forth in
              full before the committee and signed by responsible persons before any evidence shall
              be heard and that the accused shall have due notice and a fair hearing before the
              committee. 

            Mr COFFROTH said Mr McCoun was a neighbor of his, and a man of integrity and honor,
              though differing with him in politics. He did not believe any such stuff; and would
              first like to know something [ ] of these charges. 

            Mr. OVERMYER felt it to be his duty to introduce the resolution, and was ready to
              read the statements and signatures at attached on which it was passed. 

            

            Mr. COFFROTH Did they come from persons who have been in the employ of the
              Doorkeeper?

            Mr. OVERMEYER One of them was a discharged official under him; the others were from
              men who have not been in the employ of the House. 

            Mr COFFROTH But probably have been refused places by the Doorkeeper And after hearing
              from Mr Osborn, chair man of the Committee on Employes, he moved
              that the resolution be referred to that committee

            Mr. MCFADIN would like to have the name of the Assistant Doorkeeper, Mr Samuel Brown,
              included in the resolution with reference to the loss of certain documents intrusted
              to him.

            Mr RATLIFF Mr Brown is no longer an officer of the House

            Mr MCFADIN Then he could not insist

            The resolution was referred to the Committee on Employes, and Mr.
              Overmeyer was added to that committee 
          
          

          
            ORDERS OF THE DAY

            The Senate's disagreement to the House amendment to the bill [S. 90] to amend the thirty-fourth subdivision of
              section 53 of the general cities corporation act of March 4, 1867 coming up - 

            Mr. PIERCE of Porter, said it would be remembered that this bill has a local
              reference to the harbor at Michigan City, and the House amendment which was introduced
              by the gentleman from Putnam has respect to cities generally. He would therefore, move
              that the House recede from its amendment

            The motion was agreed to, and it was ordered that the Clerk acquaint the Senate
              thereof

            Bills from the Senate numbered 50, 83 and 131
              were severally read the second time. 
          
          

          
            UNFINISHED BUSINESS

            Mr. Hibee's Railroad bill [H. R. 154] which was yesterday laid on the table was
              now taken up on Mr Bobo's motion to reconsider that vote.

            Mr. BOBO explained and defended the provisions of the bill, and gave examples of its
              advantages and acceptability as a general law The bill provides that, on the petition
              of three fifths of the tax paying voters the County Board may levy a tax not exceeding
              3 per cent for any one year and which in all shall not exceed six per cent, on each
              $100 worth of taxable property for said purpose. His country and others had petitioned
              for such a law. His object in the motion to reconsider, was that the bill might go
              again to some committee that such amendments might be offered as might be acceptable
              to the House. 

            The vote was reconsidered, and the bill was referred to a special committee of five. 

            Mr. GILHAM moved that the following be also referred to said special committee:

            
              
                
                  
                    Resolved, That all donations and appropriations heretofore
                    made by County Boards be and the same are hereby legalized.
                
              
            

            The motion was agreed to. 
          
          

          
            THE CALENDAR.

             Mr. BOWEN's road toll gate exemptions bill [H. S 128] was taken up,
              read the second time and ordered to the engrossment

            The House then took a recess until 2 o'clock. 
          
          

          
            AFTERNOON SESSION.

             After several similar ineffectual motions - 

            Mr. McFADIN moved that when the House adjourn Saturday, it shall be till Tuesday at 9
              o'clock

            Mr VATER proposed ineffectually, to make it from Friday evening till Monday at 2
              o'clock

            Mr McFadin's order was then adopted. 
          

          
            THE CALENDAR.

             Mr. Welborn's bill [H. R. 95] for relief
              of John Ingle and John Ingle, Jr., was ordered to the engrossment

            Mr McDonald's special court term bill [H. R. 175] was read the second time with
              committee amendments. 

            Mr NEFF moved to lay the bill on the table; but withheld the motion. 

            Mr COFFROTH thought the principle of the bill would work well when the docket is
              heavy.

            On motion of Mr NEFF it was referred on the Judiciary
              Committee.

            Mr Pierce, of Vigo's dog bill [H. R. 211] was taken up, with the unfavorable
              committee report thereon. The report was non concurred in, and the bill was ordered to
              be engrossed

            Mr. JOHNSON, of Porter's bill (H R 117) to correct a misprint in the 16th
              Section of the contested elections act of May 6, 1852 and to provide relief in cases
              of con[es s?] erroneously commended by
              reason of the misprint of said 16th Section, and to provide for taking depositions in
              all cases of contests for circuit and district offices coming up - 

            Mr. COFFROTH, thinking the matter sufficiently clear, moved the indefinite
              postponement of the bill

            Mr GORDON liked the provisions authorizing the taking of depositions

            Mr PIERCE of Vigo, suggested that the author the Senator from Parke, (Mr. Johnson),
              is not in his place, and he moved that it be referred to the Committee on
                Elections. 

            

            The motion was agreed to. 

            Mr. Hudsons Felony bill [H. R. 198] was ordered to the engrossment. 

            Mr. Gilham's Valuation and Assessments by [H.
                R. 158] coming up - 

            Mr. COFFROTH said the bill was for a remedy against the practice of sham sales of
              property for United States bonds to avoid tax assessments.

            It was ordered to the engrossment. 

            Mr. McGregor's joint resolution No. 3 for the taxation of United States bonds
              was Committee on Federal Relations

            Mr Coffroth's bill [H. R. 186] for proceedings supplementary to executions in
              courts of Justices of the Peace, was read the second time

            It was ordered to be engrossed.

            Mr. Palmer's Evidence bill [H. R 104] amending section 397 of the Practice act,
              was ordered to the engrossment. 

            Mr. Shoemaker's Tax List bill [H R 243] coming up, with the recommendation of
              the Committee on County and Township Business - 

            Mr SHOEMAKERS explained that the object of the bill to change the time of assessments
              for taxes from the first of January to the first of March, and he stated it's
              advantages o farmers &c. 

            Mr RATLIFF and Mr HIGBEE were unfavorable to the proposed change

            Mr MONROE said he would be glad for such a change to the law as to require taxes to
              be assessed and paid in the same year, the he failed to see the need of this bill. 

            The House refused to order the engrossment - 18 to 35 - no quorum But the order was
                [?] used - yeas 28, nays 45

            Mr CORY asked, but failed to obtain leave to introduce an appropriation bill to
              defrary the expenses of the present session of the General Assembly

            Mr. Shoemaker's Cancelled County Orders Preservation bill [H. R. 213] was
              ordered to be engrossment. 

            Mr. Zenor's One Dog Exemption bill [H. R. 224] was read the second time. 

            Mr BEELER desired to gain all the revenue we may from dogs that people will keep, and
              not encourage keeping more

            Mr ADMIRE moved for a tax of $5 on each additional dog, which was laid on the table. 

            Mr. OSBORN would rather encourage the protection of sheep than encourage the keeping
              of dogs

            Mr McFADIN spoke in favor of the bill, thinking that the bill of the gentleman from
              Vigo, keeping dogs at home in the right time, would be sufficient security against dog
              depredations. 

            Mr DAVIDSON spoke against the bill He referred to the State Agricultural Reports for
              a statement, that the destruction of sheep by dogs in a single year amounted to
              fifteen millions of dollars. He preferred to let the law remain without change. If any
              change was made, he would prefer, after the tax of one dollar for the first dog, a tax
              of five dollar for the second &c. 

            Mr FURNAS thought the bill would encourage dog keeping. The dog revenue in Hendricks
              county amounts to $2 000 a year, which is nearly all expended in paying daying damages
              for the destruction of sheep by the dogs. 

            Mr BRITTON proposed to amend the bill by taxing the first dog $5, and taxing $10 for
              each additional dog. 

            Mr CUNNINGHAM made a speech more favorable to the dog, and seemed to be in favor of
              taxing dogs as other property - ad valorem. 

            Mr Britton's amendment was rejected. The bill failed on the engrossment - yeas

            On motion of Mr. STANTON the order business was suspended in order to hear a report
              from The Committee on Claims

            Mr Sabin, from the Claims Committee, reported for the allowance of
              sundry claims, for printing, clerk fees and stationary expenses incurred on account of
              the Morgan raid investigations

            On motion of Mr COFFROTH, the report was referred to the Committee on Ways
                and Means. 
          
          

          
            DISCHARGED EMPLOYES.

            Mr. ORSBORN (by consent) submitted be following:

            
              
                

                  
                    Resolved, That the employee of the last House who have been on
                    duty under the direction of the Clerk, Assistant clerk and Doorkeeper, be
                    entitled to their pay to the time of their discharge, upon the certificate of
                    the officer who appointed them.
                
              
            

            The resolution was adopted. 
          
          

          
            EXPENSES OF THE 47TH SESSION.

             Mr. CORY now asked and obtained leave to introduce a bill [H. R. 353] appropriating
              forty thousand dollars to pay the expenses of the Forty seventh Session of the General
              Assembly, which was read the first time. 

            Mr. CORY moved that it be referred to the Committee on Ways and
                Means, with instructions to report it back tomorrow.

            Mr. OSBORN proposed to amend the motion by striking out the instructions, thinking
              that there is no need of hurry in this matter. 

            Mr. CORY said his object here was business, and he considered that we should not
              allow these essential measures to go into the hands of committees to sleep there. He
              understood that some gentleman are determined that these essential bills shall not be
              passed in a certain contingency. 

            Mr. OSBORN had no concealments  Some gentlemen
              here were threatening to resign again, and boast that they have their resignations
              written in their pockets He wanted this: to go on with legislation, and at the proper
              time make these appropriations, but there was no emergency calling for immediate
              action upon them, unless it were to accommodate those resigning gentlemen. It was
              unreasonable to Bend instructions to the Committee to report this bill to morrow
              morning, who are already instructed to consider the specific bill to night. And he did
              not propose to hurry this matter of paying those gentlemen who seem almost desirous of
              an occasion to resign.

            Mr COTTON said he should be very glad to be in the condition of a paid member
              whenever it might become necessary for him to resign. But he was not in that situation
              when he resigned last March, and he had not got his pay yet

            Mr. Osborn's amendment was rejected yeas 43, nays 44 and then the bill was
              referred with Mr, Cory's instructions. 
          
          

          
            BLACKFORD'S REPORTS.

            Mr Osborn's Blackford's Reports bill [H R 61] was taken up on the second
              reading with the pending committee's amendments, author sing the Secretary of
              State to purchase 450 copies of the reports of Callaghan & Cockcroft, requiring
              annotations and stereotype, marking and distribution.

            After debate by Messrs, Stewart, of Rush, Coffroth and others

            Mr, RUDDELL proposed to amend by inserting "Merrill $ Co " in the place of
              "Callaghan & Cockcroft" wherever the latter occurs in the bill-stating
              that Merrill & Co , are willing to publish on the same terms submitted by the
              Chicago house. Pending which, after further debate by Messrs. Pierce, of Porter, Dunn,
              and others.

            The House adjourned. 
          
          
          
          
        
        

        
          IN SENATE.
          
            FRIDAY, April 16, 1869.
          

          The Senate met at 9 o'clock A M.

          The Secretary's minutes of yesterday's proceedings were being read, when-

          On motion of Mr. CARSON the further reading thereof was dispensed with. 

          
            ORDER OF BUSINESS.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR announced that, as the pending business at the adjournment on
              yesterday was the consideration of bills on the third reading, he would hold that to
              be the order of business at this time. He based this decision upon the 31 at rule of
              the Senate, which reads as follows:

            31. The unfinished business in which the Senate was engaged at the last preceding
              adjournment, shall have the preference in the orders of the day, and no motion or any
              other business shall be received without special leave of the Senate until the former
              is disposed of. - Standing Rules and Orders for the Government of The
                Senate, page [?]0. 
          
          

          
            LEAVES OF ABSENCE.

            Several Senators having asked and obtained leaves of absence for several days
              each,

            Mr. HANNA remarked that he would offer a resolution which would probably save other
              Senators the necessity of asking for leaves of absence. Already a sufficient number
              have been granted leave, or going home to-day, to leave the body without a quorum to
              do business And then,a good many members, when they came up here, did not know that,
              they would stay very long, and consequently left their affairs at home in rather an
              unsettled condition. In view of these facts and other considerations, he offered a
              resolution that when the Senate adjourns it adjourn to meet on Tuesday next., at, 2
              o'clock P. M.

            After remarks thereon by Messrs. BELLAMY, GRAY, ROBINSON of Madison, GREEN AND LEE - 

            The resolution was adopted by yeas 22, nays 16-so it was-

            Ordered, That when the Senate adjourns it adjourn till Tuesday next
              at 2 o'clock P. M.
            

            Mr. WOLCOTT suggested an early adjournment to-day, inasmuch as many of the trains
              about 11 o'clock

            Mr. ROBINSON, of Madison, moved that the Senate adjourn.

            The motion was rejected by yeas 15, nays 21. 
          
          

          
            THE JOURNAL CLERKS.

            Mr. WOLCOTT. There is a proposition which should be brought before the Senate, and
              yet it is not a privileged matter, as I understand the rules A report from the
              committee appointed to investigate as to the number of employes which should be
              retained this session was confirmed by the action of the Senate on yesterday, which
              reduces the clerical force of the Assistant Secretary to three clerks. The Assistant
              Secretary informs me that it is utterly impossible to discharge his duties with so
              little force. He further says that at no session has the force ever been less than
              six. His duties are to transcribe in full and promptly everything that transpires
              here; every paper that comes before the Senate is to be transcribed except the body of
              the bills themselves. As most of this work has to be done instantaneously, it seems to
              me we should not depart from usages that have heretofore prevailed If for a long
              series of years it has been deemed necessary that 
              six clerks should be allowed the Assistant Secretary, it must be somewhere nearly
              right I move for a new investigation of that subject.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR I would suggest to the Senator that the proper motion would
              be to reconsider the vote concurring in the committee's report. 

            Mr WOLCOTT. Then I move to reconsider with a view to a further inquiry. The Assistant
              Secretary of the Senate informs me that he was not consulted in reference to the
              subject, but the committee arrived at their conclusions from information derived
              outside.

            Mr. GIFFORD I hope this matter not hastily be entered into. Unless some good reason
              is shows I see no necessity for a reconsideration. The Committee are satisfied that
              four clerks can do all the work which as been stated by the Senator in his address to
              the Senate; and we were so informed by persons who have had experience in that
              business And especially if we are going to adjourn for five or six days at a time I
              see no necessity for keeping five or six clerks standing idle all the time. If it is
              found that three clerks cannot do the work, then it will be time enough for the Senate
              to give the Assistant Secretary power to appoint more.

            Mr. TURNER I do not know how true it is, but l am informed that we have had more
              employees than any Legislature in any of the States around us We talk about
              retrenchment the other day in regarding taking newspapers that would inform the people
              of what we are doing here; and yet, it seems, are disposed to expend money to pay
              employes that are unnecessary It seems to me that I could take three other men and do
              the work required of the Assistant Secretary; but I may be mistaken.

            Mr WOLCOTT. It seems to me proper that the Committee should hear the Assistant
              Secretary on this question. I think it was an act of discourtesy, with all respect to
              the Committee, that they did not. I still think the action of the Senate ought to be
              reconsidered, and that the Committee should take the subject into consideration
              again.

            Mr. BELLAMY It has been customary to allow the Assistant, Secretary six clerks I
              believe never less than that. I was informed by Colonel Brown, a former Secretary
              here, that was as little as he could get along with He had no interest in the matter,
              and he stated before a Committee, when called upon to know, that six were as few as
              could be go along with This does not look very well in the face of an adjournment till
              Tuesday: by which about $1,000 will be lost.I hope the motion to reconsider will
              prevail.

            Mr FISHER I voted for the report presented yesterday without knowing anything of the
              facts in the case. For the amount of labor performed at the Assistant Secretary's
              desk, I was disposed to consider that the clerical force was sufficient; but the
              statements which have been made this morning, and particularly the statement which
              goes to show that the Assistant Secretary was not consulted by the Committee, leaves
              me to suppose that there may be an error committed, which can not do any possible harm
              to enquire into. It can do no harm to reconsider, and refer the matter back to the
              Committee. If there is not force enough there they ought to have force enough; hence I
              think the Senate should reconsider its action, and make the inquiry a little
              fuller.

            The yeas and nays having been demanded, ordered and taken - 

            The LIEUTANANT GOVERNOR announced that there was no quorum voting.

            And then-

            On motion, the Senate adjourned. 
          
          

          
            THE STANDING COMMITTEES.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR, in pursuance of a resolution of the Senate on yesterday,
              "owing to the protracted and serious illness of Senator Cotley," added
              "and additional member to each of the standing committees where the name of Mr.
              Cotley appears." And heretofore, on motion, an additional member [Mr. Morgan] was

          The house met at 9 o'clock A. M., and the reading of the

            CRIMINAL CIRCUIT COURTS.

            Mr. DUNN asked and obtained leave to introduce a bill [ 
                
                  H. R. 334
                  H. H 334
                
               ] in relation to the Criminal Circuit Courts and the Judges thereof. [It
              declares their elections valid, and the proceedings of said courts legal and binding]
              It was read and referred. 
          
          

          
            COLLECTION OF SCHOOL TAX

            Mr. Palmer introduced a bill [H. R. 335] to amend section 17 of the Common School law
              [so as to provide for the collection of the special Common School tax of such persons
              have been transferred for educational purposes.] It was read and referred 
          
          

          
            LEGISLATIVE QUORUM - RESIGNATIONS.

             Mr. OSBORN introduced a bill [H. R. 336] defining certain misdemeanors, and
              prescribing punishment therefor [Any person elected as a Senator or Representative who
              shall, for the purpose of preventing a quorum, fail or refuse to quality, or who shall
              resign for that purpose, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction
              shall be fined not less than $1 000]

            Mr. OSBORN moved that it be referred to the Committee on the
                Judiciary.

            Mr. MILES moved to reject the bill. 

            After debate by Messrs. WILLIAMS, of Knox, deprecating the bill as not contemplated
              in the Governor's proclamation calling the session; and by

            Mr. JOHNSTON of Parke, against the motion, and deprecating the revolutionary act, it
              is intended to restrain - Mr. SHOAFF and Mr. McFADIN participating - 

            Mr. MILES, continuing the debate, stated that members have resigned their places here
              in order to submit a principle of the people - whether a constitutional amendment can
              subvert the Constitution of the State. And they were backed up by the people, and
              instructed to resist the fifteenth amendment to the last. They came here to do all the
              necessary legislation of the State, but when it is proposed by that legislation to put
              the fundamental law of the State in jeopardy, they are instructed.  to resist. When a fire brand of this character is thrown
              into the House, there was a justification for him to return his trust to the people;
              and it was the right and duty of a Representative, when a principle involving the
              rights of the people is attempted to be set up, if he can not resist it in any other
              way, to resign and go home, and he ought to be allowed to do so without any restraint.
              Sir, we came here on the call of the Governor to do certain necessary legislative
              business, but if instead you proceed to force upon us these fire brands of contention
              you can break up the Legislature again if you desire it.

            Mr. OSBORN did not expect to engage in any discussion of this bill this morning; but
              supposed it would take the usual course - be sent to the committee, etc. But as
              gentleman have seen fit to take the bill up at the outset he was ready to meet them.
              Now what did this bill propose? Some gentlemen denounce it as a fire brand, others as
              unnecessary legislation; and others say it is not mentioned in the call of the
              Governor. Perhaps it was not, but Democratic members have also offered bills here,
              which were not mentioned in that proclamation, and no objection was made, because the
              Governor could not name all the legislation which should be done here in a single
              proclamation. Then that was no good reason why the bill should be rejected. Then why
              were we met with this extraordinary motion? I was perhaps the first time, either at
              this session or the last, that a motion has been offered to reject a bill at once, and
              in this case it came from a quarter he had scarcely expected. What did the bill
              propose that this motion should be made with so much feeling and interest? It proposes
              that the Legislature shall do the duties which the Constitution prescribes it shall
              do. I simply proposes that members coming here, representing their people and swearing
              to support the Constitution of the State of Indiana; and if they fail to do that, they
              shall be punished for it. The Constitution of the State has provided that two-thirds
              of the members of the Legislature shall be present in order to transact business. In
              other words it shall take sixty-seven members to constitute a quorum of this House.
              So, without a quorum we can do no business at all. And this bill provides simply for
              quorum, and that any member who, for the purpose of breaking a quorum - not for any
              other cause, as sickness, &c., when he has tried to do his duty - 

            Mr. WELBORN (interposing) How is the gentleman to know motives? Is the gentleman to
              be here all the time to determine what the object is for resigning?

            Mr. OSBORN. No sir. Not at all. He left that with the court and jury, and the rule of
              law; which is determined by overt acts and declarations. He proceeded: These
              gentlemen, sir, have shown me their resignations now written out. They are ready to
              resign at any moment to prevent legislation distasteful to them. Sir, it is a sheer
              factious movement for the purpose of preventing the Legislature from performing its
              duties under the Constitution.

            Mr. WELBORN What duties?

            Mr OSBORN The Constitution requires needful legislation - the performance of our
              duties as representatives of the people. Does the Constitution make it out duty here
              to resign when the Congress of the United States proposes an amendment to the
              Constitution of the United States? The general Constitution provides that the
              Constitution of the United States and the laws of Congress in pursuance thereof are
              the paramount law of the land; and that it shall be the duty of all the Courts,
              whether State or Federal, to observe the laws of Congress and the Constitution of the
              United States, although the law of the State may be conflicting. Then I say that when
              the Congress of the United States proposes an amendment of the Constitution of the
              United States, by the same Constitution we are bound to act upon it, and whenever
              members of a Legislature refuse to act upon such a proposition they are refusing to
              support that Constitution which they have sworn to abide by and observe.

            Mr. McFADIN (interposing). Is it the duty of the majority here to pass that which
              they know is contrary to the wishes of 75 000 majority of the people of the State?

            Mr OSBORN If I admitted the premises in the gentleman's interrogatory, I might
              answer it as he would. But I do not admit that a majority of the people are opposed to
              the fifteenth article.

            Mr McFADIN. Then why don't you submit it to the people?

            Mr. OSBORN Because the Constitution of the United States says it shall be submitted
              to the Legislatures. And when you deny that, you dodge - you have not the manhood to
              do your duty.

            Mr. McFADIN Are you not afraid to submit it to the people?

            Mr. OSBORN I am not. The Constitution of the United States provides how amendments
              shall be made. And the 14th Amendment and other amendments have been ratified before,
              and none have asked that they should go to the people. I say, sir, that the only
              Constitutional way is that laid down in the Constitution itself, and that is
              submission to the Legislatures. And whenever members stand up here,  who are thinking men sent here by the people, and say
              "We are afraid to remain here and cast our votes on a question of this
              kind," it partakes of demagogueism.

            Mr. MILES (interposing vehemently.) Are you afraid of your constituents? Are you
              afraid of the people? I say that any man afraid of his constituent is a coward.

            Mr LAMBORN interposed a question of order

            The SPEAKER. The Chair hopes the gentleman will stick to the question.

            Mr. PIERCE of Vigo, was perfectly willing that cowardice or any epithet gentlemen
              please to indulge, may be implied in this debate.

            Mr OSBORN. I shall not answer the gentleman here.

            The SPEAKER The Chair is satisfied that the question of the gentleman from Sullivan
              [Mr. Miles] was not made in any offensive way. That question is for the House to
              determine. Whenever a member makes a declaration out of order, it is the duty of the
              Chair simply to submit the matter to the House

            Mr MONROE thought it better that this matter, though not a political question, should
              go to the committee.

            Mr. NEFF desired to say something; but now only that his colleague was not a
              coward

            Mr OSBORN continued. I am rather at a lost to know where I left off, and what I was
              discussing at the time of this explosion. It was as to the submission of such a
              proposition to the people. Now, sir, there is no gentleman on the floor who has
              greater deference to the people than I.

            Mr WELBORN here made the distinct point of order that the gentleman is not speaking
              to the question.

            The SPEAKER sustained the point, thinking that the debate should be confined to the
              points of the bill.

            Mr OSBORN. I propose to discuss the merits of the bill just as other gentlemen have,
              and to answer their arguments. The gentleman from Knox [Mr. Williams] said this was an
              indirect way of avoiding the submission of this question to the people. And this is a
              question on which I think a large latitude of discussion should be allowed. My only
              regret is that gentlemen have seen proper to spring it now. My idea was that it should
              go to the Judiciary Committee and take the ordinary course of bills. I have no desire
              to take an step for advancing the bill in any hurried way. I want fair and necessary
              legislation. And I regard this as necessary legislation.

            It is said that this bill ought to be rejected, because the people of the State are
              opposed to such legislation; but there is nothing in it about the Fifteenth Amendment.
              We were told by the Governor a few days ago that it has grown almost into a custom to
              prevent legislation by means of a dodge; that is for the purpose of defeating what is
              deemed a political measure - for the purpose of advancing the interests of a party -
              members would come together in a factious way for the purpose of destroying a quorum
              and preventing legislation. And he told us that both parties have been guilty of it.
              Now, sir, I deplore this state of facts as much as any man, and I offer this bill in
              good faith to prevent bolts and factious movements on both sides. It has been drawn to
              apply to both parties alike. It is true that the Democrats are in the minority now,
              and they seek to defeat the Constitutional Amendment by resigning their seats. Two
              years from now Republicans may be in precisely the same position. And this thing ought
              to be prevented. This Legislature ought to be a Legislature beyond the power of any
              factious body of men to succeed in overthrowing for political purposes. This bill is
              for the purpose of enforcing the Constitution, which says we shall have a General
              Assembly composed of not more than one hundred members of the House, and not more than
              fifty members of the Senate. This bill is nothing more than for the purpose of
              preventing this way of breaking up the General Assembly.

            Gentlemen say it is thrown in here as a fire brand - an insult to the people who have
              returned their resigned representatives. And these gentlemen claim that they have come
              back here endorsed. I do not know why my friend and colleague here (Mr. N) thinks
              about that, but I am inclined to think that he was glad to get back here, even with
              500 votes less than he had before. And last fall I received over 3,000 votes. I come
              here endorsed by more votes than he. And I speak of this as an example of the result
              in the entire State.

            Mr. McFADDIN (Interrupting). If this amendment had been placed before the people last
              fall, would you have been on the floor to-day?

            Mr. OSBORN The question, in effect, was squarely before the people. Last fall when I
              was a candidate I told the people that I would come up and discharge my duties as
              their Representative - that I would vote for or against any measure presented in a
              Constitutional way. That I have done. That the gentleman from Cass has not done. And I
              am here to-day to act - to muster up to the front and meet every question in a
              Constitutional way, without dodging - without resigning. And I hope every member elected here will have the to do the same
              thing.

            I will now say a few words in regard to the bill and then I will have done, and I
              hope that every member here who wants talk will have the privilege of doing so. I drew
              this bill at my room without consulting a single member, Democrat or Republican. I
              believe no one had seen it except myself till this morning. It has been submitted to
              no clique-to none but the Indiana Legislature-this branch of it. It is offered for the
              purpose of securing a Quorum in the Legislature-the wishes of any political party to
              the contrary notwithstanding. I repeat here that I did not intend to take any step to
              advance the passage of this bill, beyond or out of its regular coarse. Let it go to
              the Committee on the Judiciary, which has more Democrats on it than
              any other committee in the House. Let them pass upon it as to whether or not it is
              necessary legislation, and let it come back with their opinion and go upon the files
              it the regular way. I shall seek no advantage for it; and indeed if any advantage is
              attempted I believe I will pledge myself to prevent it, for these gentlemen are
              dodging at everything, like a moon eyed horse in the night Why, I was amused here all
              last week at their carefulness about a little agreement which I had to sign in order
              to get Democrats here to stay in town. And I even offered to the gentlemen from
              Huntington to go before a Notary Public and swear to it. And after they had got what I
              thought would satisfy them, they were still afraid of us. And one Democrat followed me
              to the depot and wanted to know whether the agreement had a revenue stamp upon it.
              [Laughter.]

            Mr. McFADIN. What was the reason you were afraid to make it public?

            Mr. OSBORN What was the reason you wanted to make it public?

            Mr. McFADIN. Because you wanted to carry it out very secretly.

            Mr. OSBORN You wanted a pledge, and we gave you a written pledge; then, you wanted to
              publish it to make a show that we had come down. We were not afraid, but we did not
              desire to make it public in order to give you a political advantage; but when you
              failed to comply with it, then we did make it public.

            Then I say, without detaining the House longer, that this bill is legitimately before
              the House in the regular way, and I hope the motion to reject will be voted down
              promptly. And I want to see our Democratic friends voting with us, instead of
              threatening to leave us here, because a bill has been offered simply for the purpose
              of a misdemeanor. But when "Sambo" comes up, then I suppose they will go and
              tell the people they can not stay.

            Mr. NEFF regretted the motion to reject the bill He said his colleage (Mr Osborn) did
              a great deal to effect the organization even to the point of offending his party
              friend, and this bill might be by way of salve for his course in that matter. If this
              bill were to go to the Judiciary Committee, he rather thought it
              never would be heard of again He regarded it as unconstitutional. He was satisfied
              that it could never pass the General Assembly And it ought not to pass, in his
              judgment. He replied to the intimation that he was glad to be returned by the people
              to his place again, by stating that the reason why he had no opposition was because no
              man could defeat him on the issue. He reviewed the history of legislative bolting, and
              justified certain occasions for resigning office: otherwise, it would be to make an
              official position like a prison to every free man accepting office. He closed by
              intimating again the excuse of his colleague for submitting this bill because the
              gentleman desires to regain the disfavor he had incurred

            Mr PIERCE of Porter, said it had been the feeling of Republicans, and he had felt it
              himself, that some such bill as this ought to be brought forward. And a leading
              Democrat of the Senate had said, that after the present occasion to resign had passed,
              he would himself be in favor of such a bill. We are simply forestalling that action by
              the opposition

            Mr. PIERCE, of Vigo, said there was nothing startling in the proposition, or in the
              motion to refer it to the Judiciary Committee. But the gentleman
              from Sullivan [Mr. Miler] makes a motion that brings the question directly before the
              House. He rehearsed the pledges by which the organization was effected; the order to
              postpone the Fifteenth amendment. He appealed to gentlemen to vote down the motion;
              and when the bill comes up in order, he would be prepared to meet its enemies on
              principle.

            Mr. SHOAFF rather regretted the motion to reject, for the bill, if good, certainly
              needs amendment. It should provide against the death as well as the resignation. In
              reply to Mr Pierce, of Porter, he admitted that he resigned in March even to break a
              quorum, and so, as best he could, to prevent infraction of the Constitution he had
              sworn to support He cared not now whether this bill goes to the committee or not. He
              warned gentlemen against trenching too far on the rights of the minority-that they may
              not be left again, without tho power to legislate. He spoke  to concilitate, and would rather the motion to reject
              might be withdrawn, and depend for its defeat upon the feeling and the belief that it
              is unnesessary at this time in the legislation of the State.

            Mr. STEWART, of Rush, objected to the motion to reject, on the ground that it is
              discourteous. He showed that the principle of penalty for refusing to qualify was not
              new. There was a statutory provision which imposes a fine of $6 upon so low an officer
              as a supervisor of highways if he refuses to qualify.

            Mr. CARNAHAN said that was the only case of penalty of refusing to qualify.

            Mr. STEWART continued. He was opposed to gentlemen setting themselves up in their
              seats here, ex cathedra, as judges of the Constitution; and rehersed
              his objections to the motion to reject.

            Mr. VATER contended for the free exercise of the judgement of the representative in
              cases where he does not know the wish and will of his constituents on the questions of
              the Fifteenth Amendment be believed that his constituents, and his people of the State
              would sustain him. And if they would not, he was willing to risk it. It was manifestly
              the duty of the enemies of the Fifteenth Amendment, knowing the will of their
              constituents to be against it, to stand here and combat it, and not dodge and run away
              from their plain duty. He said that, in come quarters, the patriotism of these
              resigning members was doubted. And their dutiful consideration of the bill would
              exonerate them (as he was willing to do,) from that imputation.

            Mr. McFADIN charged that in his region this question involved in the Fifteenth
              Amendment was dodged last fall. If they had come out last fall, in its favor, the
              Democracy would have come out more than 50 000, at least. And if the Amendment should
              be adopted by this body, they come here under misrepresentations before the people.
              Being ruled out of order on this line of remarks, he proceeded to reply to Mr.
              Osborn's remarks on the outside proceedings by which the organization of the
              Session was effected.

            Mr. STANTON submitted, whether the majority or the minority of the counties have a
              right to instruct their representatives to break up the Legislature?

            Mr. McFADIN held that representatives have the right to obey the instructions of a
              majority of their people. He spoke at length of the unmistakable emphasis of the
              popular indorsement which he received - getting a hundred Republican votes, etc. He
              spoke of the monstrous impropriety of hastily passing a proposition against the will
              of the majority, which it is impossible to reverse. And this Fifteenth Amendment once
              passed, can not be reversed, either by the courts, the powers at Washington, or even
              the people themselves. He closed by correcting the error in these reports of his
              remarks yesterday in regard to the loss of documents at the post office. He simply
              wanted to inquire whether the blame at the post office or with the officials of the
              House.

            Mr. HAMILTON moved to lay Mr. M's motion on the table - the vote thereon
              resulting - yeas 46, nays 31, as follows:

            
              
                
                   YEAS. Messrs. Baker, Barnett, Beatty, Bowen, Breckenridge,
                    Chapman, Davidson, Davis of Elkhart, Dunn, Fairchild, Field of Lake, Field of
                    Lagrange, Furnas, Gilham, Goodman, Green, Hall, Hamilton, Higbee, Higgins,
                    Lutson, Johnson of Parke, Kercheval, Lamborn, Mason, Millekan, Miller, Monroe, Osborn, Overmeyer, Pierce of Porter,
                    Pierce of Vigo, Radcliff, Ruddell, Sabin,
                    Skidmore, Smith, Stanton, Stewart of Ohio, Stuart of Rush, Taber, Underwood,
                    Vater, Williams of Hamilton, Williams of Union, and Mr. Speaker - 45

                  NAYS - Messrs. Admire, Bates, Briton, Calver, Carnahan, Cave, Cory, Cotton, Cunningham,
                    Dittemore, Fuller, Hutchings, Hyatt, Johnson of Montgomery, Logan, Long,
                    McBride, McDonald, McFadin, McGregor, Mives, Mack, Montgomery, Neff, Odell,
                    Shoemaker, Sleeth, Sunman, Tebbs, Welborn, and Williams of Knox - 31.
                
              
            

            So the motion to reject was laid on the table.

            And then, on the motion of Mr. OSBORN, the bill was referred to the
                Committee on the Judiciary.

            Mr. DUNN asked and obtained leave to introduce a bill [H. R. 337] to amend section 5
              of the act in relation to commissioners, certificates and resignations of office.

            [It proposes that members of the General Assembly, when the resign, shall tender
              their resignations to that branch of the General Assembly to which they belong for

              with Mexico upon the pension roll on an equality with the soldiers in the war of the

              of the session, with an amendment making the sum $60,000

              the General Assembly; but a special session of the 46th General Assembly.

            The SPEAKER said the question is on non-concurrence in the amendment reported by the
              committee.

            It was adopted, and then the clerical error was corrected.

            Mr Cory's motion was then agreed to, and the bill was read the second time

            POSTAGE STAMPS.

            Mr. HADLEY offered a resolution that  the
              Librarian provide each Senator and officer with fifteen dollars worth of postage
              stamps in the proportion they may order.

            Mr. MORGAN thought the appropriation of fifty dollars at the last session was enough,

            Mr. STEIN was of the opinion that this proposition should go to the Standing
              Committee where similar propositions are. All these propositions should stand on a
              perfect equality.

            Mr. CAVIN reminded the Senate that the proposition itself embodies a proposal for a
              conference with a committee of the Legislature; and that the Standing Committee was
              composed of so many it could not act so well and expeditiously as a committee of four
              or six.

            The resolution was rejected.

                  EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT, INDIANAPOLIS, April 16, 1869.

                  
                    Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives
                  

                  It affords me great pleasure to transmit to you copies of a proposition
                    received yesterday from Hon. John Purdue, a liberal minded and generous citizen
                    of our own State, whereby he proposes to devote one hundred and fifty thousand
                    dollars of his private fortune to the use of the Agricultural College, upon
                    certain conditions mentioned in the proposition.

                  I trust this munificent offer will receive prompt, careful and earnest
                    consideration in connection with the location of the Institution which has
                    already commanded so much attention.

                  Whatever your ultimate decision may be in relation to the location of the
                    institution, the liberality and generosity of Mr. Purdue's offer cannot
                    fail to command the admiration of all those who know how to appreciate a public
                    spirited and unselfish dedication of private wealth to this public benefit.

                     To his Excellency, Conrad Baker, Governor of Indiana:
                  

                  SIR-As the General Assembly at its present session will
                    doubtless be called upon to consider the questions relating to the establishment
                    and location of the Agricultural College, contemplated by the act of Congress of
                    July 2, 1862, I desire to avail myself of the opportunity to tender a
                    testimonial to the county in which I have spent thirty years of the ripeness of
                    my life, and also to manifest my interest in the cause of collegiate education,
                    by offering (as I now do, through your Excellency, to the State of Indiana) to
                    donate the sum of one hundred and fifty thousand dollars for the use of said
                    college, provided the General Assembly will, by law, secure me in the following
                    conditions:

                  First. Locate the said College at such point in Tippecanoe county as may be
                    decided upon by a majority of the present Board of Trustees of the Indiana
                    Agricultural College, to whom I be added as a member.

                  Second. Name the institution by an irrepealable law "Purdue
                    University."

                  Third. Provide that I be a member of the Board of Trustees having the control
                    of said Institution, and should I cease to be such, I be retained as an advisory
                    member thereof, and have visitational power over the University during my
                    lifetime.

                  Upon these conditions I offer this donation which I agree to pay in yearly
                    instalments of fifteen thousand dollars until the full sum of one hundred and
                    fifty thousand dollars is paid; and I am prepared to tender my obligations
                    accordingly, as may be required.

                  I will thank you to present my offer to the Houses of the General Assembly for
                    their consideration. 

                  
                    Very respectfully yours,

              being read the third time-

            On motion of Mr. STEIN, it was laid on the table.

            Mr. Kinley's bill [S. 36] prohibiting the retailing of intoxicating liquors to
              be used as a beverage, was read the third time. [It declares places of sale public
              nuisaaces; and fines the vendor from $20 to $100, to which m&y be added
              imprisonment, etc.]

            The bill was rejected by yeas 10, nays 26.

            Mr. Howk's bill [S. 40] to repeal the 44th and 82d sections and amend the 81st
              and 113th sections of the General Criminal Practice act of June 17th, 1852, and to
              regulate the practice as to continuances and changes of venue in criminal actions in
              this State, was read the third time.

            It failed for want of a Constitutional majority, by yeas 22, nays 15.Mr.
              Scott's, bill [S. 45] relating to the salaries of the Judges of the various
              Courts in this state, being read the third time-

            On motion by Mr. STEIN, it was made the special order for Friday, at 2 o'clock
                P. M.

             [Mr. FISHER, by leave, offered a resolution, which was adopted, that when the Senate
              adjourn it be till 9 o'clock to-morrow.]
          
          

          
            THE MEDICAL PROFESSION.

            Mr. Hess' bill [S. 75] to protect the citizins of Indiana from empiricism and
              elevate the standing of the medical profession being read.

            Mr. BRADLEY believed there ought to fee some protection against quackery in the
              practice of medicine, but did net believe we should require a certain standard that
              was not furnished in the State; and so he argued we are not yet ready for the
              enactment of such a law.

            Mr. STEIN was very much of the same mind as the Senator from Hendricks. He opposed
              the starting of monopolies in this way, and would at all times be found opposed to
              monopolies in every shape.

            

            Mr. GRAY should vote for this bill, though not such an one as he would like to have,
              because the neighboring States have similar laws, and such an one is now necessary to
              protect ourselves from the horse doctors and quacks of other States. He did not look
              upon it as a monopoly to pass this bill.

            Mr. MORGAN has been practicing medicine for nearly one-third of a century, and has
              always been opposed to legislation on the subject; but inasmuch as neighboring States
              have enacted similar laws, he had consented to favor it. And he defended it from the
              charge that it was a monopoly. This bill was intended more for the protection of the
              community than of the profession.

            Mr. GIFFORD said the bill was not intended to create a monopoly. All the schools of
              medicine are equally represented in the bill. He regarded it as necessary for the
              protection not only of medical men, but of the public.

            Mr. HAMILTON indicated his opposition to the bill.

            The bill failed to pass, for want of a Constitutional majority-Yeas 25, nays 12.
          
          

          
            BILLS ON THE THIRD READING.

            Mr. Gray's bill [S. 85], to amend section 60 of the general City Incorporation
              law of March 14, 1867, was read a third time.

            Mr. GRAY explained that the bill extends the power of cities to aid any other public
              improvement a majority may petition for, etc.

            It was passed-Yeas 33, nays 5.

            Mr. Hughes' bill (S. 100) to amend the 6th section of the Indiana University
              relief act, approved March 2, 18597 being read the third time

            It was passed the Senate by yeas 37, nays 0.

            Mr. Green's bill (S. 102) to amend the 5th division of the 2nd volume Revised
              Statutes of 1852, chap. 1 of the general practice act, was read the third time. [The
              Judge to instruct the jury before the argument commences.]

            The bill failed for want of a constitution al majority-yeas 22, nays 14.
          
          

          
            COUNTY LIBRARIES.

            Mr. Cavins' bill (S. 107) to amend sections 2 and 3 of the act for the
              incorporation of county libraries, was read the third time.

            Mr. CARSON objected to the sum-one per cent of the taxable property, as in many cases
              amounting to too much to be expended by County Commissioners at their own discretion
              in this way.

            Mr. CAVIN explained that the bill gave the County Commissioners power to expend one
              per cent, of the property taxable for county purposes alone, for the purchase of
              county libraries. The revenue therefrom would not be large-it would amount to about
              $2,000 in Marion county. He urged considerations which should commend the bill to the
              favorable consideration of members.

            Mr. ANDREWS also favored the passage of the bill.

            Mr. CARSON again presented objections.

            Mr. BRADLEY thought the bill one Of doubtful propriety. There was too much machinery
              about it. It involves too large an amount of money to be expended for the purpose
              named. And then the location of the county library at the county seat would make it of
              little benefit to the citizens of the county at large.

            The bill was rejected by yeas, 17; nays 22.

            And then the Senate adjourned till 9 o'clock to-morrow.
          
          

        
        

        
          HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.

           The House of Representatives met at 9 o'clock A. M., and the
            reading of the journal was dispensed with for the present.

          On motion of Mr. WILDMAN, Mr. Williams of Knox, in conjunction with the Clerk, was
            appointed a committee to recover such bills of the former sessions as may have been lost
            from the files of the Clerk.

          On motion of Mr. OSBORN Mr. Shoemaker was added to the Committee on
              Manufactures.

          The SPEAKER stated that Mr. Wildman was appointed to serve on the Committee on Ways and
            Means, but by inadvertance his name was omitted in the original announcement of that
            Committee.

          Mr. STEWART, of Rush, submitted the following:

          Resolved, by the House of Representatives, In view of the large
            amount of business now demanding action, that no new measures will be entertained until
            the calendar shall have been called once through, and all pending matter be disposed
            of.

          Mr. JOHNSON,of Parke, asked whether the House could establish a rule without a
            quorum?

          The SPEAKER answered in the negative, and ordered a call of the House.

          The call of the roll determined 59 members present.

          The call of the House having been dispensed with-

          Mr. STEWART, of Rush, moved to take up and read bill's on the Calendar in their
            earlier stages. But-

          Mr. BARRETT made the point (which was sustained) that without a quorum the House can do
            nothing but adjourn, etc. Whereupon-

          On the motion of Mr. WILLIAMS, of Knox, the House took a recess till 10 1/2
            o'clock.

          

          SPEAKER resumed the Chair at 10 1/2 o'clock.

          Mr McFADIN moved ineffectually for a call of the House.

          The SPEAKER said: As it is evident that there is not a quorum, the Chair will order a
            call of the House.

          The call proceeded, and 72 members responded. 

          
            PETITIONS.

             Mr. OSBORN submitted a petition from citizens of Lagrange county, asking for
              modifications of the Divorce law.

            The SPEAKER laid before the House a memorial from the State Board of Education for
              change of the law regulating the election of School Trustees, and for a Township
              Library tax. 
          
          

          
            TOWNSHIP LIBRARIES.

            Mr. OSBORN, in connection therewith, obtained leave to introduce a bill (H. R. 339)
              for a tax of one-fifth of a mill on the dollar for replenishing of the township
              libraries. 
          
          

          
            LIFE INSURANCE-VETO.

             The Speaker laid before the House the Governor's message, dated March 9, 1869,
              returning, with his veto, Mr. Underwood's Life Insurance bill (H. R. 60) for an
              act for the incorporation and continuace of insurance companies; authorizing them to
              reissue their risks, exempting certain policies of life insurance for attachment by
              creditors; making all policies non-forfeitable after two full annual payments;
              repealing, &c.

            Mr. UNDERWOOD said the objections of the Governor could be removed by throwing out of
              a single word, the word "being." He moved that the vote for the passage of
              the bill be reconsidered, and to lay the motion to reconsider on the table.

            After debate on the question of order involved, by Messrs. Underwood, Osborn, Pierce,
              of Porter, Chittenden, the Speaker, Williams, of Knox, Stewart, of Rush, Gil-ham,
              Cory, and others-

            Mr. CORY moved to refer the matter to the Committee on
              Insurance.

            Mr. CHITTENDEN proposed the Committee on Judiciary.

            Mr. WILLIAMS of Knox, read the Constitutional proviso with reference to action on
              vetoes; and the question of order was further discussed by Mr. Pierce of Vigo, Mr.
              Osborn, and others.

            Mr. MITCHELL moved to lay the matter on the table, and that it be deferred till 10
              o'clock to-morrow; and after further discussion of the order, Mr. Mitchell's
              motion was rejected.

            Mr. Chittenden's motion to refer to the Committee on the
                Judiciary, was also rejected; and the question recurred on Mr. Cory's
              motion to refer to the Committee on Insurance, which was also
              rejected.

            Mr. UNDERWOOD moved that the bill become a law, notwithstanding the Governor's
              veto, without any desire for the success of the motion.

            Mr. KERCHEVAL. Since the Chair decides that the bill can not be amended, the only
              course that remains is for the House to decide whether the bill shall become a law,
              notwithstanding the veto; and this was sustained by Messrs. Osborn, Sabin and others.
              So that question was decided in the negative. Yeas, 0; nays, 80.

            Mr. McFADIN submitted the following, desiring that it should be read for the benefit
              of the House, and while he did not expect it would be spread on the broad pages of the
              journal, he hoped it would not escape the hand of the reporter:

            WHEREAS, The honorable member from Hamilton county left this State, went into another
              and took to himself a wife. Therefore,

            Be it Resolved, That he has the congratulations and tender solicitudes of all the
              members of this House, in this important and solemn change in his natural life; and
              hope that the copartnership will result favorably to the happy member and his
              posterity; and would say to each single individual: Go thou and do likewise.

            Mr. STEPHENSON proposed to amend by substituting the following:

            Resolved, That as the subject of marriage is so exciting to the gentleman from Cass,
              Mr. McFadin, and as he labors under that excitement at present, therefore that a
              committee of three be appointed to soothe him, and that they be empowered to send for
              all the necessary papers and persons, provided that the said gentleman shall have
              choice of persons.

            Resolved, That said committee, after initiating the said gentleman, shall report to
              this House in full; and should the gentleman expire in the attempt, that said committe
              report his dying declarations for the benefit of the ancestors that are to come after
              us.

            Mr. McFADIN. I move for the adoption of both bills. [Laughter.]

            Neither of these propositions could be entertained.

            Mr. PIERCE, of Vigo, (obtaining leave for the purpose,) submitted the following,
              which was adopted:

            
              
                
                  Resolved, That His Excellency, the Governor, be requested to
                    furnish to this House the number and names of the prisoners confined in the
                    penitentiaries of this State who have received pardons since the 1st day of
                    January, 1867, to the 1st day of April, 1869; also, the crimes of which they
                    were convicted, and the periods of time for which they were to be imprisoned.
                  
                
              
            
          
          

          
            JUDGES OF CRIMINAL CIRCUIT COURTS.

             Mr. DUNN obtained leave to submit a report from the Judiciary Committee returning
              his bill [H. R. 334] in relation to the
              Criminal Circuit Courts, and the Judges thereof, with a recommendation for its
              immediate passage, and he moved, ineffectually, that the Constitutional restriction be
              suspended for the purpose, two-thirds of a quorum refusing to vote in the
              affirmative.

            Mr. KERCHEVAL obtained leave to  submit a report
              from the Committee on Banks, and returned the bill [S. 161] to provide for the organization of
              Savings' Banks, with an amendment proposing a section to declare an
              emergency.

            Mr. STEWART, of Rush moved to take up the consideration of his resolution, offered
              this morning, and it was read again by the Clerk. He supposed that if this order was
              passed we could get through the pressing business in the course of to-day and
              to-morrow.

            Mr. WELBORN suggested that a proposition to change the rules must lie over one
              day.

            The SPEAKER ruled that the point was well taken.

            Mr. STEWART. Let it go over, then.

            Mr. CORY moved for a suspension of the order of business for the consideration of his
              Legislative Appropriation bill. [H. R. 733.]

            Mr. VATER was sorry to see the consideration of this bill urged upon the House to the
              exclusion of important legislation so long delayed, and by the action of the very men
              now urging this bill.

            Mr. CORY denied that this bill is pressed upon the House to the exclusion of
              others.

            Mr. STANTON made the point, which was sustained, that a motion to suspend the order
              of business is riot debateable, and then-

            Mr. CORY'S motion was agreed to by yeas 42, nays 39, and the bill was taken up
              and read a third time.

            Mr. VATER moved to recommitt the bill to the Committee on Ways and
                Means, with instructions to report as to the expediency of passing it
              now.

            Mr. NEFF moved to lay Mr. Vater's motion on the table, which was decided in the
              negative - yeas 53, nays 29, and the question recurred on the passage of the bill.

            Mr. BARRITT demanded the previous question.

            Mr. GORDON made an ineffectual motion to adjourn.

            And then, the previous question having been seconded, and the main question ordered,
              the bill was finally passed in the House of Representatives - yeas 53, nays 27. 
          
          

          
            INDIANA CENTRAL RAILROAD.

             Mr. OSBORN submitted the following, which was adopted:

            
              
                
                  
                    Resolved, That the President and Secretary of the Indiana
                    Central Railroad be, and they are hereby, requested to report to the House a
                    copy of the official reports made by the officers of said company from their
                    organization up to this time, and especially to report the amount paid by the
                    State to said Company for the transportation of troops, provisions and munitions
                    of war from 1860 to this time. That the Clerk of the House be, and he is hereby
                    directed, to furnish a copy of this resolution to said officers immediately.
                
              
            

            The House then took a recess till 2 o'clock.
          
          

          
            AFTERNOON SESSION.

             Mr. WELBORN announcing that Mr. John S. Davis, Representative elect for the county
              of Floyd is present, that gentleman came forward and received the oath of a member of
              the General Assembly, at the hands of the Speaker, and took his seat. 
          

          
            STANDING COMMITTEES.

             The Speaker then completed the announcement of the Standing Committees of the House
              of Representatives as follows:

            THE SPECIFIC APPROPIATION BILL.

             On motion of Mr. VATER, the order of business was suspended for the Committee on
              Ways and Means to report on the Specific Appropriation bill, [H. R. 311]. Whereupon-

            Mr. STANTON, from said Committee, returned said bill, with amendments, adding
              sections 30 to 60 inclusive.

            On motion of Mr. WILLIAMS, of Knox, the order of business was further suspended, for
              the consideration of this bill on the second reading.

            On motion of Mr. CHITTENDEN, the bill was read and considered by sections.

            The bill having been read through and considered by sections-  The amendments of the Committee on Ways and
                Means were concurred in.

            Mr DAVIDSON moved an additional action for $113-to Lucy Shaeffer, to pay the expenses
              of the funeral of her late husband who died a member of the General Assembly of 1863,
              which was agreed to.

            Mr. STEWART, of Rush, proposed $2,000 for the General Hackelman monument.

            Mr. CHITTENDEN proposed a substitute $1,000 each for monuments to ex-Governor
              Jennings, ex-Governor Willard and General Hackelman.

            Mr. STEWART of Rush said $1,000 would be insufficient for a monument suitably to
              distinguish the grave of General Hackelman among the monuments around the place where
              he was laid away.

            Mr. McFADIN supported the substitute and it was adopted.

            Mr. UNDERWOOD proposed $100 each to Wm. M. Merwin and John O. Hardesty for indexing
              the journal of this special session, which was agreed to.

            Mr. STANTON proposed an allowance for extra expenses by the Committee on the
                Prison.

            Mr. GREEN moved to lay it on the table, which was agreed to-affirmative 53, negative
              not counted.

            Mr. RUDDELL proposed to add a section for compensation of certain witnesses attending
              each one day before said committee in their investigations.

            On motion of Mr. McFADIN, it was laid on the table.

            On motion of Mr. WELBORN, the bill was considered as engrossed.

            On his further motion, the constitutional restriction was removed, and the bill was
              put upon its third and last reading in the House.

            Mr. STANTON asked and obtained unanimous consent to submit the following:

            SECTION -. That A. E. and W. H. Drapier be allowed for the same number of copies of
              the Brevier Legislative Reports of the Forty-sixth General Assembly, furnished every
              session since 1857, the same price paid per page for the last several volumes.

            Mr. OSBORN said that he understood that the appropriation is for an allowance that
              shall embrace the reports of the proceedings of both sessions.

            Mr. STEWART, of Rush, understood that the price for these Reports is two-thirds of a
              cent per page per copy.

            The amendment was agreed to.

            The bill was then finally passed the House of Representatives-yeas 77, nays 2. 
          
          

          
            BENEVOLENT INSTITUTIONS.

             Mr. STANTON asked and obtained leave to introduce a bill [H. R. 340] to make
              appropriations for certain purposes, and upon certain conditions therein
              expressed.

            It provides that whenever there shall be a failure to pass appropriation bills for
              the maintenance of the Benevolent Institutions of the State, it shall be lawful for
              the Governor to draw his warrants on the Treasury for that purpose-not exceeding the
              amount appropriated for said purposes by the last preceding session of the General
              Assembly.

            On motion of Mr. STANTON it was -referred to the Committe on Benevolent
                Institutions, with instructions to report on the same to-morrow morning.
            
          
          

          
            25TH FEDERAL CIRCUIT.

             Mr. RUDDELL, obtaining leave, introduced a bill [H.
                R. 341] creating the Twenty-fifth Judicial Circuit, providing for the election
              of a Judge thereof, and for the transference of business thereto. [It affects the
              counties of Morgan, Johnson and Shelby.] Referred to a special committee of the
              Representatives from those counties. 
          
          

          
            PURDUE UNIVERSITY.

             The SPEAKER laid before the House a communication from the Governor, enclosing a
              proposition from the Hon. John Purdue, of the county of Tippecanoe, to make a donation
              of $150,000, for his private part of the donation for the location of the Agricultural
              College, on condition of its location in Tippecanoe county, its being called the
              Purdue University, etc.

            On motion of Mr. PIERCE, of Porter, the communication was referred to the special
              committee on that subject, consisting of one from each Congressional District. 
          
          

          
            COUNTY RAILROAD SUBSCRIPTIONS.

             Mr. HIGBEE, from the special committee thereon, returned his bill [H. R. 154] to
              authorize Boards of County Commissioners to levy taxes for donations to railroads,
              etc., with amendment by substitute. [When a majority of the taxpayers petition, it
              shall be lawful for the Commissioners to tax 1 1/2 per cent per annum, and not
              exceeding 5 1/2 per cent for any one road.] 
          
          

          
            FIFTH COMMON PLEAS DISTRICT.

             Mr. STEWART, of Ohio, called up the bill [S.
                320] to amend the first section of the act of 1867, for regulating the time of
              Common Pleas in the Fifth District, and repealing the act of February 4, 1869.

            The constitutional restriction having been suspended for the full and final
              consideration of this bill, and Mr. Dunn's Criminal Court bill [H. R. 334]-

            On motion of Mr. STEWART, of Ohio, the bill [S.
                320] was carried to the final passage without amendment-yeas 71, nays 1. 
          
          

          

          

            CRIMINAL CIRCUIT COURTS.

             Mr. Dunn's bill [H. R. 334] in relation to the Criminal Circuit Courts and the
              Judges thereof, being taken up-

            Mr. DUNN said the question was still a dubious one whether these Criminal Courts are
              constitutional or not; and, however it might be determined, this bill can do no harm.
              But if the Supreme Court should hold that these courts are unconstitutional, the
              effect will be, that every conviction in a Criminal Court-every single sentence from
              the Judges of these Criminal Courts will be invalidated. Every prisoner they have sent
              to the penitentiaries will be releasd and become a ground of action for false
              imprisonment, for work done and labor performed, &c. This bill was for remedy in
              either case, as far. as may be. But if the Supreme Court should decide the act
              authorizing these Criminal Circuit Courts unconstitutional ab
              initio, and he were asked whether, in that event this bill would offer a complete
              remedy, he would be obliged to say he could not answer the question. Still, he offered
              it as a remedy for settling the terms of these judges, etc.

            Mr. ZOLLARS could not think the Supreme Court would so decide, and he was not ready
              to vote for the bill.

            Mr. DUNN was not directly interested in the passage of this bill above any other
              gentleman who is intrested in having the questions involved settled on the statute
              book.

            Mr. DAVIS of Floyd-Has this bill been before the Judiciary
                Committee of the House?

            Mr. DUNN. Yes; and they have recommended its passage.

            Mr. ZOLLARS feared the passage of the bill would involve new difficulties.

            Mr. WELBORN saw no objection to the passage of the bill at once. It could do no harm,
              and if the Supreme Court should decide the law creating these Courts unconstitutional,
              it would offer a statutory remedy. He thought it extremely doubtful whether these
              Criminal Courts are Constitutional Courts. If they were their Judges can hold but four
              years. He might say that this bill had been drawn in anticipation of the decision of
              the Supreme Court, and to avoid the consequences set forth by Mr. Dunn.

            Mr. ZOLLARS submitted: if these prisoners have been illegally convicted, can you
              convict them by legislative action?

            Mr. WELBORN. We may do the very best we can. This is the best remedy we have got. We
              will close the doors on them if we can. We will remedy the evil if it can be
              remedied.

            Mr. ZOLLARS. Suppose the Supreme Court decides that these courts are not Circuit
              Courts, will this bill override the decision?

            Mr. WELBORN. No.

            Mr. STANTON (to Mr. Zollars.) Have you got a better remedy?

            Mr. ZOLLARS. I have not.

            Mr. STANTON. Then why not pass it? He then demanded the previous question and order
              its force, the bill was carried to the final passage in the House of
              Representatives-yeas 72, nays 7. 
          
          

          
            INFANTS IN THE COTTON MILLS.

             Mr. SHOEMAKER (by leave) returned from the Committee on
                Manufactures Mr Williams, of Union's bill, [H. R. 283], to regulate
              the employment of persons under sixteen years of age in the cotton and woolen
              manufactories, and to provide fop the education of such persons, recommending its
              passage, and on his motion it was taken up and ordered to the second reading.

            Mr. KERCHEVAL proposed to amend, by striking out the word "eleven" where it
              occurs in the bill, and inserting "ten" in lieu.

            Mr. RUDDELL. That leaves the law where it now stands. This bill is for the purpose of
              encouraging this class of capitalists instead of discriminating against them. We have
              no law which prohibits them from working their hands more than ten hours a day. In
              Ohio and Illinois they may work eleven hours, and in Kentucly there is no
              limitation. Now, when capitalists compare our inducements with those of other States,
              are they going to stop here and invest their money while we are thus discriminating
              against them? One hour with the manufacturers amounts to one-tenth of their profits.
              There is but one factory in the State, he said, which regards this law; and in the
              years 1866, 1867, and 1868, this factoro paid $23,950 84 local tax, exclusive of
              Government revenue. This bill was t copied from the Rhode Island statute, and worked
              well.

            Mr. STEWART, of Ohio, proposed to amend the amendment, by restricting the work to
              " eight" hours a day.

            Mr. KERCHEVAL said he offered his amendment not so much in the interests of
              capitalists as in the interests of humanity. Both political parties had pledged
              themselves to the eight hour system; and this bill proposes to make these tender
              children work eleven hours a day.

            Mr. McFADIN favored the amendment, and rehearsed how, in 1867 here, he lost
              confidence in a prominent Democratic friend, because he was in favor of working these
              tender children more than ten hours a day. He denounced the heartlessness of the
              proposition, and approved Dr. Franklin's division for eight hours for labor,
              etc.

            

             Mr. STEWART, of Ohio, had offered his amendment in good faith, and advocated it
              under a profound sense of humanity and its justice.

            On motion of Mr. WILE, the further consideration of the bill was postponed, and it
              was made the special order for Thursday at 10 o'clock.

            The House then adjourned. 
          
          
          
          
        
        

        
          IN SENATE.
          
             WEDNESDAY, April 21, 1869.
          

          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR called the Senate to order at 9 o'clock A.
              M.

          The Secretary's minutes of yesterday's proceedings were, being read,
            when-

          On motion by Mr. BEARDSLEY, the further reading thereof was dispensed with. 

          
            REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES

             were received, and concurred in, declaring further legislation inexpedient on the
              vagrant bill H. R 36; the descent-law-amendment-bill S. 39, and the spring balances
              bill S. 63. 
          
          

          
            STAMPS AND STATIONERY.

             Mr. GIFFORD offered a resolution that each Senator and officer be allowed $3 worth
              of stamps.

            Mr. ROBINSON, of Decatur, offered a substitute that the Librarian furnish each
              Senator with what stationery he may order.

            On motion by Mr. FISHER the substitute was laid on the table.

            An amendment proposed by Mr. RICE to allow but 50 cents worth, was laid on the table
              by yeas 30, nays 14.

            Mr. CARSON proposed an amendment for $15 worth of stamps and stationery.

            Mr. CHURCH offered a substitute allowing the Lieutenant Governor and each Senator $30
              worth of stationery and stamps.

            Mr. CARSON withdrew his amendment.

            Mr. RICE made an ineffectual motion to reduce the amount to $10.

            The substitute was agreed to. 
          
          

          
            RESOLUTIONS.

             Mr. SHERROD offered a resolution that the Committee on Finance be
              required to report the Appropriation bill at the earliest possible day.

            The resolution was adopted.

            Mr. CAVIN offered a resolution, allowing the Judiciary Committee a
              clerk.

            Mr. RICE offered a resolution allowing a clerk to the Committee on
                Corporations.

            Mr. FISHER offered a resolution allowing a clerk to the Committee on
                Finance.

            These resolutions were severally adopted.

            Mr. GRAY offered a resolution that leaves of absence shall not be granted whereby
              more than ten Senators at a time shall be absent.

            On motion of Mr. CARSON it was referred to the Committee on Rights and
                Privileges of the Inhabitants of the State. 
          
          

          
            THE GENERAL APPROPRIATION BILL.

             Mr. HANNA offered a resolution requesting the Committee on
                Finance to report the General Appropriation bill.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR stated that a similar resolution had just been adopted.

            Mr. WOLCOTT asked and obtained leave to report from the Finance
                Committee the bill [H. R. 309]
              making general appropriations for the years 1869 and 1870.

            On motion by Mr. CARSON the Senate resolved itself into a Committee of the
                Whole [Mr. Gray in the chair] for the consideration of this bill. [H. R. 309.]

            On motion by Mr. CRAVENS it was ordered that this General Appropriation bill be
              considered by sections.In section 6 the Governor's contingent fund was raised
              from $2,000 to $5,000.In section 13 an error of the enrolling clerk was corrected,
              making the appropriation $10,000 instead of $2,000 for furnishing the new wing of the
              Insane Asylum.

            Section 16 appropriating $3,000 for miscellaneous purposes was stricken out; and the
              section making an appropriation for the pay of Judges and Prosecuting Attorneys was
              numbered 16 instead.

            When section 23 had been read-

            Mr. HOOPER stated that it was understood that a proposition was now before the House
              of Representatives from the National Soldiers' Home at Dayton to take care of the
              inmates in the Home at Knightstown, and suggested that action on this appropriation be
              suspended for the present.

            Mr. HADLEY saw no reason for delay. He had no hope that an arrangement could be made
              with the Home at Dayton, by which all could be taken care of.

            Mr. WOLCOTT understood that the Dayton Home proposed to take care of those only that
              we had no room for. Nor did he understand it to be a permanent arrangement proposed.
              It is too indefinite to constitute a basis for our action in this matter, The Finance
              Committee propose an amendment to this section, increasing the appropriation in such a
              way as to alter the section almost entirely. The Committee propose to make an
              appropriation of $30,000 to increase the facilities of the Homes grateful
              acknowledgement of the obligation of the State to the parents of the children now in
              its charge, and $5,000 for the purchase of more ground; they have not as much as they
              can till. The Committee's substitute retains the appropriation of $15,000 to pay
              the indebtedness of the instution.

            Mr. BELLAMY sent to the Clerk's desk  a
              letter from the Secretary of the Dayton Home, and asked that it be read for the
              information of Senators.

            It is as follows:

            
              
                
                  
                  
                    THE NATIONAL ASYLUM FOR DISABLED VOLUNTEEERS, DAYTON, O., April, 19,
                        1869.
                    HON. A. P. STANTON- Dear Sir:
                  

                  Yours has just been received, and I hasten to answer. The reports you have
                    heard are unfounded. True, we have now 1,100 men on our rolls, but we are not full. We can easily take all their men, and care for them
                    better than it is possible for you to do at your Knightstown Home, well
                    conducted as I know it is. And to prove this I would much like to have your body
                    send over a committee to see what we are doing, and propose to do in the
                    future.

                  The Chicago and New Jersey Homes have just been broken up, and all the men
                    transferred to us. The Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Detroit Homes have
                    transferred nearly all their men all I believe but those too sick to be removed.
                    The Albany and Rochester (New York) Homes are also preparing to transfer their
                    men to us. Why should Indiana alone, of all the States, continue to keep up a
                    State institution? Ought she not at least to see whether there
                      really be any occasion for such an expenditure?

                  But, while the General Government cares for the soldier, she has made no
                    provision for the widows and orphans; and here is the work, as you suggest,
                    which your State ought to do, and can well do at Knightstown. At best, it will
                    not accommodate, if given up wholly to them, one half of those who in your State
                    really need such an asylum.

                  
                    Truly, but hastily, yours,
                    LEWIS B. GUNCKEL
                  

                
              
            

            Mr. HOOPER insisted that the matter should be investigated.

            Mr. WOLCOTT took the responsibility of withdrawing the committee substitute for this
              section.

            Mr. HADLEY hoped the committee amendment would not be withdrawn. He was certain our
              citizen-disabled soldiers would not go to Dayton, no matter what arrangement was made.
              Are we going to be ungrateful enough to banish them? They could not visit their
              families as often if sent out of the State; and such an action on our part would be an
              evidence of ingratitude.

            Mr. FISHER concurred in the propriety of withdrawing the committee amendment, there
              being a bill pending for the current expenses of the Knightstown Home. We may think it
              best to transfer these men to Dayton, but that was a question that ought to receive
              earnest consideration-and if they should go we probably have buildings enough for the
              orphans left at the Knightstown Home, consequently the committee's amendment
              would not be desirable at this time.

            Mr. CHURCH could not see the depth of that patriotism that would lead us, while we
              are helping support the Dayton Home, to support another in our own State when the
              former can accommodate the inmates of the latter. So far as the soldiers being
              convenient to home is concerned, we should not complain of the distance, to Dayton if
              soldiers from Vermont and New York, and other States far away, do not complain. If the
              Dayton Home will not take all of them let it take what of them it will, and those that
              are left or refuse to go, let us take care of them.

            Mr. SHERROD opposed the appropriation because the National Government has made ample
              provision for disabled soldiers and very properly, too.

            The section as it came from the House was agreed to, appropriating $25,000 for
              current expenses and $15,000 to pay outstanding indebtedness.

            Section 25, appropriating $1,500 for clerk hire in the State Military Claim Agency,
              being read-

            Mr. HANNA understood that the State was keeping a sort of pensioner here who was of
              but little benefit to the people. He also regarded the agent as being very
              inefficient, and such an one should not be paid by the State. He ought to be
              discharged whether the office was abolished or not.

            Mr. JAQUESS testified to the benefits to the soldier-claimants conferred by this
              Agency within his personal knowledge.

            Mr. TURNER opposed the proposition, because the benefits of this agency, if any,
              operates very unequally, yet all alike are taxed for its support.

            Mr. JOHNSON, of Spencer, knew most all of the solders in his county drew their pay
              through this agency.

            Mr. GREEN had found it was a drawback upon the soldier to place his claims in the
              hands of the agent here, and explained why he looked upon this agency as a useless
              thing for the past year or two.

            Mr. FISHER understood that a large majority of these claims were of an intricate
              nature; and that this agent had collected thousands of dollars which probably never
              would have been collected in any other way. He favored the pending section, that the
              thousand unsettled claims now in the hands of that agent may be closed up
              properly.

            Mr. SHERROD moved to strike out the section.

            Mr. FOSDICK insisted that it was not necessary to employ a clerk to close up this
              agency, as the papers in each case should be at Washington, and not here. His
              experience was decidedly against the efficiency of this claim agency at Indianapolis.
              If the agency is abolished, the officials at Washington will correspond at once and
              directly with the claimant. He favored the motion to strike out.

            The motion to strike out was agreed to upon a division-affirmative 31, negative not
              counted.

            Section 26, making an appropriation for the public printing, having been read

            

            Mr. WOLCOTT stated that the committee had an amendment pending, making the
              apportionment for 1869 and 1870 $50,000 instead of $27,000, as in the original
              section, which was intended to apply for one year only, though the section reads for
              the years 1869-70.

            The committees amendment was agreed to.

            Mr. WOLCOTT stated that the Finance Committee had two sections to add to the
              appropriations of 1869; viz: a-section appropriating $5,000 for the erection of an
              engine and boiler house for the State's prison north; and a section appropriating
              $6,660 98 to pay claims on file for services rendered by men of the State militia
              during the late war.

            Mr. FISHER, as ex-paymaster of the State militia, remarked that these were of the
              same class of claims as have heretofore been paid, and he supposed them to be all
              right.

            The two additional sections were agreed to.

            Mr. CARSON moved, ineffectually, to strike out "$1,000"' and insert
              "$500,*" for incidental expenses of the State Librarian, for 1870.On his
              further motion, the sum of "$1,000" was reduced to "$500" for
              incidentals for the offices of Secretary and Auditor of State for 1870; and
              "$1.500" was stricken out and "$500" substituted for the
              distribution of laws and public documents for 1870.Then Section 29, as amended, was
              adopted.

            On motion by Mr. GREENE, the Committee rose, reported progress, and asked leave to
              sit again.

            The report was concurred in.

            On motion by Mr. BELLAMY, the House concurrent resolution for the appointment of a
              joint committee of three Representatives and two Senators to visit the National Asylum
              for disabled soldiers at Dayton, to determine upon the expediency of transferring the
              inmates of the Soldiers' Home at Knightstown to said Asylum at Dayton, was taken
              up and concurred in.

            And then the Senate took a recess till 2 o'clock p. M. 
          
          

          
            AFTERNOON SESSION.

             Bills for acts were introduced, read the first time, and severally passed to the
              second reading, to-wit:

            By Mr. BELLAMY [S. 336] authorizing the Governor of the State to remove prison
              directors in certain cases. [When guilty of malfeasance in office.]

            By Mr. CRAVENS [S. 337] to make appropriations for certain purposes. [When there
              shall be a failure at any session of the Legislature to make certain appropriations
              the Governor may issue his warrant upon the Treasurer of State for sums not exceeding
              the amount appropriated by the General Assembly. 


          
            THE GENERAL APPROPRIATION BILL.

             On motion of Mr. FISHER, the Senate resolved itself into a Committee of the
                Whole [Mr. Gray in the chair] to resume the consideration of the General
              Appropriation bill [H. R. 309].Section 31, appropriating $2,000 for the contingent
              fund of the Governor, having been read-

            Mr. WOLCOTT said the Finance Committee proposed to amend by making
              the sum $5,000.Mr. CARSON objected to the amendment.

            Mr. FISHER explained that this sum was placed at the disposal of the Governor to aid
              in the faithful execution of the laws, and he thought the safety and good of the State
              demanded such an appropriation.

            Mr. BRADLEY moved to amend the amendment by requiring the Governor to report to the
              next session of the General Assembly the sums expended, to whom paid, and what
              for.

            Mr. MORGAN believed there was a necessity for the Committee's amendment. Crime
              is on the increase, and we should have the advantage of every possible means for the
              detection of crime.

            Mr. STEIN. Should we adopt the amendment to the amendment, we would be perpetrating
              an insult on a co-ordinate department of the Government. It would be, in effect, an
              insult upon the Governor to compel this appropriation, with a requirement that he
              should reveal the disposition made of it. What is there in the conduct of the present
              Executive to distrust that functionary? Neither the history of State nor the history
              of the nation furnishes any such precedent.

            Mr. BRADLEY disclaimed any disposition to distrust the Governor, or reflect upon His
              Excellency, unfavorably, in this matter.

            Mr. STEIN-In order to make this appropriation a weighty engine for the suppression of
              crime we must trust it to the honesty and honor of the Governor.

            Mr. BRADLEY regarded it as a torturing of language to construe this section as an
              authorization for the Governor to use this appropriation for the detection and
              suppression of crime. The words of the section are "for the civil contingent fund
              of the Government."

            Mr. GIFFORD saw no impropriety in demanding that the Governor shall report to the
              Legislature what disposition he may make of the fund.

            The amendment to the amendment was agreed to upon a division-affirmative 23, negative
              21.

            

            Mr. CRAVENS opposed the adoption of the proviso, because it inevitably casts a slur
              upon the Executive of the State. The fund should be left in the hands of that officer
              without the casting of an imputation upon the Executive of the State, and rather than
              do so he would prefer to see the additional appropriation fail.

            Mr. GIFFORD could see no necessity for such sensitiveness upon this subject. He
              thought it no slur upon any one to require the keeping and presentation of vouchers
              for public monies expended.

            Mr. TURNER saw no insult in requiring a public official to give a strict account of
              public monies entrusted to his hands.

            On motion by Mr. CRAVENS, the amendment, as amended, was indefinitely postponed.

            Mr. TERNER moved to amend the section as it stands in the bill by adding a clause
              that the Governor report the amount used, for what purpose expended, and to whom
              paid.

            The amendment was agreed to upon a division-affirmative 22, negative 20.

            The section, as amended, was adopted, upon a division-affirmative 23, negative
              18.

            Section 34, appropriating $1,000 for office rent, traveling and other expenses of the
              Attorney General, having been read-

            Mr. STEIN offered an amendment, identical with Mr. Turner's, for a report to the
              Legislature of the sums expended, to whom paid, &c.

            The amendment was agreed to, upon a division-affirmative 26, negative not
              announced.

            Mr. JOHNSON, of Montgomery, moved to reduce the amount from $1,000 to $500.

            Mr. WOLCOTT thought it unnecessary to defend the propriety of appropriating the
              amount in the section as it comes from the House. We are doing such ridiculous things
              here, however, he hardly knew what to expect. He gave reasons why the amount should
              not be cut down.

            After a humorous conversational debate-

            The amendment was rejected.

            The section, 36, as amended, was adopted.

            Section 36, appropriating $2,000 for incidental expenses of the Supreme Court, having
              been read-

            Mr. STEIN moved to amend by requiring an itemized report to be made by the Judges and
              Sheriff to the General Assembly of the amount expended, to whom paid, &c.

            Mr. TURNER made an ineffectual motion to strike from the amentment the word
              "Judges."

            The amendment was agreed to.

            The section, as amended, was adopted.

            Section 38, making $30,000 appropriation to the Asylum for the Blind, having been
              read-

            Mr. STEIN moved to amend by adding a requirement for an itemized statement of the
              expenditures to be made to the General Assembly.

            The amendment was rejected.

            Section 43 appropriating $3,000 for miscellaneous expenses was stricken out.

            Section 44 appropriating $1,000 for incidental expenses of the Auditor of
              State's office, being read-

            Mr. CARSON moved to reduce the amount to $500.

            Mr. STEIN moved an amendment to the amendment, requiring an itemized statement to be
              reported to the General Assembly.

            Mr. CARSON accepted the amendment

            On motion of Mr. BRADLEY, the amendment, as amended, was indefinitely postponed.

            Mr. STEIN renewed his amendment as an amendment to the section as it stands in the
              bill, and it was agreed to.

            The section forty-four, as amended, was agreed to.

            The Finance Committee amendment to section forty-five, increasing
              the appropriation for the House of Refuge from $20,000 to $40,000 for the year ending
              March 30, 1870, was agreed to-

            Mr. TURNER desiaed to reduce the amount from $40,000 to $30,000, and he made that
              motion.

            The amendment was rejected upon a division-affirmative 16, negative 17.

            After debate-

            Mr. TURNER moved to strike out $40,000 and insert in lieu $39,000.

            Mr. BELLAMY raised the point of order that the Committee's amendment, having
              been agreed to, the amendment was not in order.

            The CHAIRMAN so ruled.

            Mr. BRADLEY moved to reconsider the vote last taken.

            On motion of Mr. HANNA the vote adopting the Committee's amendment was
              reconsidered.

            Mr. TURNER renewed his amendment as an amendment to the Finance
                Committee's amendment, to strike out $40,000 and insert $30,000.

            It was agreed to.

            Section 45, as amended, was adopted.

            Section 47, appropriating $79,000 for the State Normal School, being read-

            Mr. CARSON made an ineffectual motion to reduce the amount to $50,000.

            The section was adopted upon a division affirmative 24, negative 14. 

            On motion, by Mr. WOLCOTT, this section was placed among the appropriations for
              1869.

            Mr. RICE moved to reconsider the vote cutting down the contingent or incidental  expenses of the Superintendent of Public
              Institutions, from $1,000 to $500.

            The CHAIRMAN ruled the motion to reconsider out of order, though he entertained a few
              minutes before a similar motion, in order to get the committees out of an
              entanglement.

            On motion, the committee rose, reported the bill, with the committee amendments, to
              the Senate, and asked to be discharged from its further consideration.

            The report was concurred in.

            Mr. BEARDSLEY offered a resolution, which was adopted, that when the Senate adjourn
              it adjourn to meet at 9 o'clock tomorrow.

            Mr. BELLAMY gave notice of his intention to move, to-morrow, for an amendment to rule
              37, by striking out all after the word "introduced," in the third line and
              inserting the following:

            On first reading in the order in which they were reported by committees, on second
              reading; and in the order in which they were ordered to be engrossed on the third
              reading, unless in case of urgency.

            Mr. BRADLEY offered a resolution requesting the return from the Governor of the bill
                [S. 90] that it might be correctly
              enrolled.

            The resolution was adopted

            And then the Senate Adjourned. 
          
          
          
          
        
        

        
          HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.

          The House met at 9 o'clock, A. M. The reading of the Journal
            was dispensed with. 

          
            PETITIONS.

             Mr. Williams, of Union, presented the claim of Andrew Keep.

            Mr. HIGBEE and Mr. BRITTON also presented papers, the former on Temperance and the
              latter a remonstrance of 1,200 citizens of De Kalb against the Fifteenth Article
              amendment. 
          
          

          
            REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.

             Mr. HUNT, from the Committee on Ways and Means, reported on
              certain military disbursements by the Governor, that he acted properly, under
              authority.

            Mr. BRECKINRIDGE, from the Committee on Rights and Privileges,
              returned the petition of citizens of Jefferson, praying for the release of a certain
              school officer from the repayment of certain school moneys stolen, recommending that
              its consideration be indefinitely postponed. The report was concurred in.

            He also returned Mr. Davidson's bill [H. R. 291] defining who shall be eligible
              to vote, etc., recommending that it be indefinitely postponed. The report was
              concurred in.

            Mr. HIGBEE, from the Committee on y and Township Business,
              returned Mr. Corry's bill [H. R. 289] providing that no elector shall vote for
              Supervisor who do not reside in his District, recommending that it be laid on the
              table.

            The report was concurred in.

            Mr. BRITTON, from the same committee, returned Mr. Wildmaux bill [H. B. 221] for
              Seldon's book-keeping in the offices of County Auditors and Treasures,
              recommending that it lay on the table.

            The report was concurred in.

            Mr TABIN, from the same committee, returned Mr. VATER'S bill [H. B. 319] to
              repeal the bill of March 4, 1869, repealing

            Mr. STANTON, from the special Committee on Committee Rooms, reported-ample
              accommodations for committee rooms in the Capitol Building, in charge of Mr.
              Slocum.

            These reports were severally concurred in. 
          
          

          
            THE FIFTEENTH ARTICLE.

             Mr. COFFROTH (by unanimous consent) presented the remonstrance of 2,000 citizens of
              the counties of Ohio and Switzerland, against the ratification of the 15th article
              amendment, and instructing their Senator, Mr. Bellamy, and their Representative, Mr.
              Stewart, to resist said ratification or resign. 
          
          

          
            THE SOLDIERS' HOME.

            Mr. STANTON (obtaining leave) submitted the following:

            
              
                
                  Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring
                      therein), That a Joint Committee of five, consisting of three on the part
                    of the House and two on the part of the Senate, be appointed to visit the
                    National Asylum at Dayton, Ohio, with a view to the transfer of the inmates of
                    the Soldiers' Home to that institution.
                
              
            

            Mr. Stanton caused the letter addressed to him by the Secretary of the National
              Asylum at Dayton (printed in the Senate ' proceedings of this day) to be read in
              this matter, stating that this action was to result in the soldiers being better cared
              for by the National Government; whilst it would admit of the State's
              appropriating the Home building as an Orphan Asylum. 

            The resolution was adopted. 
          
          

          
            SOUTHERN PRISON INVESTIGATION.

             On motion of Mr. RUDDELL, it was ordered that the testimony taken by the Joint
              Committee for investigation of the affairs of the Southern Prison, transmitted from
              the Senate, be now read.

            The testimony of J. B. Merriweather having been read-

            Mr. UNDERWOOD moved that the testimony be printed.

            After some conversation between Mr. Coffroth and Mr. Ruddell touching certain
              testimony before the Committee, given by said Merriweather, and not included in the
              report, and after the reading of a copy of  such
              rejected or suppressed testimony, which Mr. Coffroth had sent up-

            Mr. COFFROTH moved to print the suppressed testimony.

            Mr. WILLIAMS, of Knox, submitted the following:

            Resolved, That the report of tho evidence before the
                Committee on Prisons be referred to the Judiciary
                Committee, with instructions to inquire whether the said Directors or
              others are not liable under it, and if so, that suit be brought against them, etc.

            Mr. RUDDELL said the Directors' attention was called to that, and they had acted
              on it in their supplementary report to the Governor. He insisted that the House itself
              should inspect the report, which was the result of a faithful and conscientious
              investigation. He did not expect the report to be referred to another committee.

            Mr. WILLIAMS desired it referred, that we might get from gentlemen learned in the law
              a report as to whether the facts authorize suits to be brought. He meant no disrespect
              to the Committee on Prisons.

            Mr. STEWART, of Rush, was favorable to the reference.

            Mr. GORDON preferred to hear all the evidence first.

            Mr. JOHNSON, of Parke, could see no impropriety in the reference to another
              Committee.

            Mr. PIERCE, of Vigo, said the House was not unwilling to hear the testimony there was
              a difference of opinion as to how the testimony should come before the House.

            Mr. DUNN submitted a resolution for a substitute for the pending motion-to concur in
              the report to discharge the Committee, and send the papers to the Attorney General
              with instruction to proceed against the parties in his discretion.

            Mr. COFFROTH made the point, that the motion of Mr. Williams is not germain to the
              motion to permit, and therefore not in order.

            The SPEAKER. The motion to refer has precedence of the motion to print.

            Mr. JOHNSON, of Parke, continued. He was in favor of printing the evidence. He then
              stated the reasons why he should oppose the reference.

            Mr. WILLIAMS, of Knox, modified his motion so as to include an order to print.

            Mr. OSBORN preferred to leave the matter in the hands of the Prison
                Committee till we have time to understand the testimony.

            Mr. McFADIN commended the industry of the Committee on Prisons.
              They had brought out evidence of monstrous frauds and corruptions in the management of
              the Southern Prison. Then why not hear the evidence, and act upon it? He might be
              satisfied with the reference again, but it would be like going over the same again. He
              would have the testimony printed.

            Mr. BARRITT opposed recommitment as he would oppose delay in this matter. He referred
              to the difficulty with which the chairman of the Prison Committee
              had been met in getting this report and evidence before the House; and opposed
              printing chiefly becuse of the delay which it would induce.

            Mr. OVERMYER opposed the reference as he would oppose a movement to delay and
              smmuggle this report beyond the action of the House. He moved to lay Mr.
              Williams' resolution and Mr. Dunn's substitute on the table, demanding the
              yeas and nays.

            Mr. DAVIS, of Floyd, preferred that the report be printed; which might be done and in
              the hands every member by to-morrow or next day.

            The SPEAKER stated the question. The printing of the report has been ordered. The
              first motion is to print the evidence

            Mr. CUNNINGHAM demanded a division of the question-the first vote on tabling Mr.
              Dunn's resolution.

            Mr. DENNIS' substitute was laid on the table-yeas 73, nays 7.

            Mr. WILLIAMS, Of Knox, obtained leave to withdraw that part of his motion which
              proposes to refer to the Judiciary Committee, and, the remainder-to
              print 200 copies-was adopted.

            Mr. COFFROTH desired that the rejected testimony be included in the order to print,
              and made that motion.

            Mr. DAVIS, of Floyd, supported the motion, and after desultory consideration thereon
              by Messrs. CORY, RUDDELL, PIERCE of Vigo, and others, with reference to a waive in
              blank in the suppressed testimony of J. B. Merriweather.

            Mr. VATER moved to amend Mr. Coffroth's motion by adding that said testimony be
              not printed till the blank is filled.

            Mr. COFFROTH stated that he submitted the paper as suppressed matter, and had not
              examined it; was unaware of the blank; and that, as the success of Mr. Vater's
              motion would prevent the printing, he moved to lay it on the table.

            The question was decided in the negative, yeas 34, nay 50; and the question
              recurred.

            Mr. DAVIS, of Floyd, interrogated the Chairman, Mr. Ruddell, as to this part of
              evidence, as to whether a journal of the committee's proceedings was kept,
              showing, that this evidence was rejected as if revelent; and that perhaps Mr.
              Meriweather took a copy of that part. Mr. D. insisted that the House has a right to
              this potion of the evidence before the committee it were in the power of the committee
              the name in blank should be furnished-to  relieve
              the House from the awkwardness of position of ordering printing when a certain blank
              can be filled.

            Mr. RUDDELL, Mr. LAMBORN, Mr. BARRITT, and every member of the Prison
                Committee, stated that, while they could remember, that that testimony was
              before the Committee, they could not recover the same.

            Mr. DAVIS of Floyd, concluded, asserting as before, the rights of the House and the
              duty of the Committee, and calling for a division of the question.

            Mr. WILSON submitted that this was not a case of suppression, but of rejection of
              testimony. He considered that the Committee had a right to exclude this testimony, and
              that it couid not be printed without injustice to some.

            Mr. NEFF considered that there was unnecessary nervousness about this matter. But he
              could not see how it should be concluded against using this testimony. In reply to Mr.
              Ruddell, he supposed this Prison Committee went down there to
              investigate all frauds connected with the prison, and was riot confined to the conduct
              of Mr. Merriwether. He admitted that the committee intended no unfairness, that they
              acted in all faithfulness and honesty, but now when this matter is sprung upon them it
              was strange to see members of the committee objecting to the printing.

            Mr. CORY said the committee were not objecting to printing the testimony; but what
              they wanted was that the testimony to be printed shall be complete.

            Mr. NEFF. That was the only strange thing about the matter-that these gentlemen
              oppose the printing of this testimony, which is admitted to be genuine.

            Mr. JOHNSTON, of Parke, proposed to amend, by adding: "and that the Committee on
              Prisons be requested to fill the blannk." He submitted that the Committee were
              probably able to fill the blank, and that the House has the right to require the
              Committee to fill it.

            Mr. STANTON. Was it the Committee or other parties proposing to bring this testimony
              before the House? He submitted that the filling of the blank belonged to those sending
              this testimony into the House. They should do that, or state the reason why they
              cannot do it; and until they do that-the one or the other-he submitted that the House
              ought not to print the testimony.

            Mr McFADIN. Was there any other testimony suppressed.

            Mr. RUDDELL. It was merely rejected testimony-rejected as irrevalent matter-relating
              to things which transpired long ago. In reply to Mr. Coffroth, he replied that while
              the order of the House was to investigate the affairs of the prison, the Committee
              (the Sub-committee) considered it their special duty to investigate charges against
              Merriweather and Ghee. He did not recollect that this testimony, just brought in here,
              was even taken down by the Committee's Clerk.

            Mr. CHITTENDEN moved to lay Mr. Jolmston's, of Park, amendment on the table,
              which was decided in the negative yeas 39, nays 40, and question recurred on Mr.
              Jolmston's motion.

            Mr. VATER. It was assumed that the committee have been trying to suppress evidence,
              while the fact was that gentlemen desire to thrust evidence upon the House which is
              not completewhich is not evidence, but was rejected by the committee.

            Mr. Johnston's amendment was adopted yeas 39, nays 38-aand the question recurred
              on the adoption of Mr. Vater's motion as amended.

            Mr. COFFROTH now said he would accept Mr. Vater's amendment, as amended, as a
              part of his motion.

            Mr. WILLSON moved to lay the motion, as amended, on the table; which was decided in
              the negative-yeas 37, nays 41: and the question again recurred.

            Mr. LAMBORN made an ineffectual motion to adjourn.

            Mr. JOHNSTON, of Parke, now demanded the previous question.

            Mr. COFFROTH said he accepted the amended proposition of Mr. Water as part of the
              text of his motion, originally approved, which he read as follows:

            
              
                
                  
                    Resolved, That the suppressed testimony of J. B. Meriweather
                    be printed with the other testimony taken by the Committee ;_that the blank be
                    filled-and by the committee.
                
              
            

            Mr. RUDDELL and Mr. WILSON taking a distinction between "suppressed" and
              "neglected" testimony-

            Mr. COFFROTH (by consent) changed the word " suppressed " to the word
              "omitted," and so it was adopted-yeas 45, nays 29, as follows:

            The House then took a recess till 2 o'clock. 

          
          

          

          
            AFTERNOON SESSION.

             The Senate bill No. 328, for meetings of District Appraisers, the Indiana University
              bill [S. 100], the City Railroad amendment bill. [S. 85], were severalty read and
              passed to the second reading.

            Mr. UNDERWOOD made an ineffectual motion to take up the bill [S. 8] for the
              suppression of prize fighting.

            The bill [S. 291] for transfering Brown county to the Second Circuit, and the bill
                [S. 290] creating the Twenty-sixth Circuit,
              were severally read and ordered to the third reading. 
          

          
            TWENTY-SIXTH CIRCUIT.

             Mr. CORY moved the suspension of the constitutional restriction to admit of the
              passage of the-Court bill [S. 290.]

            Mr. OVERMYER moved to amend, by adding the bill [S. 292.] 

            Mr. STANTON made the point that the amendment is not germane to the proposition.

            Mr. COFFROTH supported and the SPEAKER sustained the point of order.

            The constitutional restriction as to the bill [S.
                290] was then suspended-yeas 70, nays 14-and the bill was then again read.

            It creates the Twenty-sixth Judicial Circuit, fixing the times of holding Courts
              therein, and fixing the times of holding Courts in the Fourth Judicial Circuit.

            It was finally passed the House of Representatives without amendment-yeas 76, nays
              12.

            Mr. OVERMYER moved, ineffectually, to suspend the Constitutional restriction for the
              final consideration of the Brown county transference bill [S. 292]yeas 46, nays
              34two-thirds not voting in the affirmative.

            Mr. ZOLLARS moved to suspend the Constitutional restriction to save one read-of the
              Savings Banks' bill [S. 161]. 

            Mr. COFFROTH did not think the friends of this bill should press it in this way. He
              knew the question was not debatable; but, regarding it as a most infamous bill, he
              hoped the restriction would not be suspended.

            Mr. ZOLLARS withdrew the motion. 
          
          

          
            AGRICULTURAL REPORTS.

             On motion of Mr. FURNAS, the order of business was suspended, for the consideration
              of his Agricultural and Horticultural Reports Appropriation bill [H. R. 194], and it
              finally passed the House-yeas 78, nays 0.

            Mr. BEELER moved ineffectually to take up his bill [H. B. 206] for the transfer of
              Marion county to-the Southern Prison district.

            On motion of Mr. McFADIN Mr. Logan's fox and wild cat bill [H. B. 168] was taken
              up. (It provides 50 cedts for scalps.)

            Mr. BRITTON proposed to strike out the words "under six months old," which
              agreed to.

            Mr. DAVIDSON proposed, ineffectually to make it read "red foxes."

            The bill was then ordered to be engrossed. 
          
          

          
            THE CALENDAR.

             The bill [S. 161] to provide for the
              Organization of savings banks, was read the second time with the committee's
              recommendation.

            Mr. COFFROTH moved that the bill reported to the Committee on the
                Judiciary.

            Mr. ZOLLERS opposed the motion an supported the bill, setting forth especially the
              security to depositors which is require by the 14th section. It was a bill to be
              beneficial in its effects to the poorer men of th country. It had been before the
              proper Committees of both Houses, and its passage was fully recommended.

            Mr. NEFF supported the motion to refer the bill again, and, if it has merits wanted
              to vote for it.

            On motion of Mr. ZOLLARS the motion to refer was laid on the table.

            Mr. MITCHELL proposed to amend the first section, by appropriately inserting after
              the words, "five thousand dollars in real estate," then: "exclusive of
              perishable improvements."

            The amendment was adopted: and then the emergency clause reported by the committee
              was also adopted.

            Pending the question on ordering the bill to the third reading-

            Mr. COFFROTH stated, at length, his objections to its passage. If this bill becomes a
              law, he would as soon deposit his money in a Pharo Bank, as in such a Savings Bank as
              it contemplated. The provision in the first section, that the seven stockholders are
              required to be each possessed of $5,000 in real estate, and the amendment to this by
              Mr. Mitchell, (which was very well,) did not offer security to depositors. There was
              no provision to secure depositors from first to last. The security provided in the
              fourteenth section did not secure depositors because the officers of these banks were
              to manage them under the Directors. The Governor "may require the officers of
              these banks to give security." Another objection was, that is the sixteenth
              section it is provided that deposits cannot be withdrawn without notice ranging in
              time proportionate to the amount to be withdrawn-extending to as long a time as ninety
              days. He objected, also, to the 54th section, which provides that moneys of minors and
              insane persons may be deposited, without security, so as not withdrawn till the
              minor's majority, &c. He denounced the bill as an attempt to  fasten a confidence game upon the statute book. He moved
              that it be indefinitely postponed.

            Mr. KERCHEVAL replied, complaining of the harshness of the gentleman from Huntington,
              in applying to the bills the estimation which he has for a grand confidence games. He
              said to the gentleman and the House that the Committee on Banks
              were ready to vote for any amendment that would better secure depositors.

            Mr. GREEN defended the bill stating that it has been drawn after the savings banking
              statutes of New York and, other Eastern States, under which there have been no
              failures.

            On motion of Mr. RATLIFF, the vote by which Mr. Coffroth's motion to refer was
              laid on the table was reconsidered; and then-

            The bill was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary, with
              instructions to report thereon next Friday. 
          
          

          
            THE CALENDAR.

             The Drainage assessment bill [S. 89] amendatory of the act of March, 2, 1867, was
              read the second time.

            Mr. PALMER proposed to amend by striking out all after the creating clause, and
              inserting matter by way of substitute.

            Mr. PIERCE, of Porter, moved that the bill and proposed amendment be referred again
              to the Committee on County and Township Business.

            Mr. STEWART, of Rush, moved, inaffectually, to refer to the Committee on
                Rights and Privileges.

            Mr. Pierce's motion was then agreed to.

            Mr. RATLIFF proposed a further amendment, which was referred without reading.

            Mr. OSBORN called up his bill [H. R. 322] , to
              enable railroad companies to protect their lines by connections, but, pending the
              question thereon,

            The House adjourned. 
          
          
          
          
        
        

        
          IN SENATE.
          
            THURSDAY, April 22, 1869.
          

          The Senate met at 9 o'clock A. M.

          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR laid before the Senate a message from the Governor,
            transmitting a communication from the Auditor of State, concerning necessary legislation
            in the matter of the appraisement of railroad property in this Mate, recommending the
            passage of a bill supplemented to an act passed December, 1865, to procure a just
            valuation of the railroad property in this State.

          Mr. SCOTT was satisfied that there was more cheating done in the appraisement of
            railroads than in the appraisement of any other property in the State, and that this
            bill should receive careful consideration.

          Mr. BRADLEY insisted that a bill could not get in the Senate in this way.

          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR held that the bill was read only as a part of the
            Governor's message.

          On motion by Mr. HANNA, it was referred to a select committee. 

          
            RULES AND ORDERS.

             Mr. STEIN called up Mr. Bellamy's proposition to change the rules, submitted
              just before the adjournment last evening.

            The amendment of the rule was agreed to. 
          
          

          
            JOURNAL CLERKS.

             Mr. WOLCOTT moved to reconsider the vote of the Senate reducing the number of
              employes of the Assistant Secretary, and that the matter be referred back to the
              committee.

            The motion was agreed to. 
          
          

          
            GENERAL APPROPRIATION BILL.

             On motion of Mr. CARSON, the General Appropriation bill [H. R. 309] was taken up on the second reading.

            Mr. HANNA moved to amend by adding; to section 16 (the appropriation for pay of
              Judges and Prosecuting Attorneys) a provision for pay of $500 or such other sum as the
              law provides to Prosecutors and Judges in the Civil Criminal Courts.

            The amendment was agreed to.

            The amendment of the Committee of the Whole increasing the civil
              contingent fund of the Governor for the year 1869 from $2,000 to $5,000 corning
              up-

            Mr. BRADLEY moved to concur with the amendment, requiring an itemized statement of
              its expenditure to be reported to the Legislature next session.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR held that a vote should be taken upon this motion as an
              independent amendment.

            It was agreed to, by yeas 23, nays 21.The amendment as amended was rejected by yeas
              15, nays 30.

            Mr. BRADLEY moved to amend this section of the bill by adding the requirement for an
              itemized statement of its expenditure to the next session of the General Assembly.

            The amendment was rejected by yeas 23, nays 23, the Lieutenant Governor voting
              "no."

            Mr. BIRD, having voted under a misapprehension, desired to change his vote.

            Objection being heard,

            On motion by Mr. BIRD the vote was reconsidered.

            The question recurring on the amendment,

            It was again rejected by a tie vote-yeas 23, nays 23-the Lieutenant Governor voting
              "no" 

            

            The amendment of the Committee of the Whole, appropriating $50,000
              for the State printing in 1869-70 being read-

            Mr. TURNER stated that a bill has been passed the House [H. R. 194] providing for the
              printing of the Agricultural and Horticultural reports, under the supervision of said
              societies. He was authorized to say that the societies have tried both ways and can
              get their reports printed as well by private parties, and about 33 per cent cheaper
              than by the State Printer. Therefore, he moved to strike from the section such a sum
              as will cover the printing of these reports.

            Mr. FISHER was sure the volume published by the State Printer was far better than the
              other volume.

            Mr. TURNER obtained his statement from a member of the Board of Agriculture and had
              but ltttle personal knowledge of the matter.

            Mr. FISHER was willing to favor the motion, for reasons which he gave.

            Mr. TURNER was of opinion that the Society got a book one-third larger than that
              printed by the State Printer.

            Mr. FISHER had reference particularly to the workmanship.

            Mr. WOLCOTT regarded the imputations as unjust against the State Printer.

            Mr. TURNER did not appreciate the vindication of the State Printer, as made by Mr.
              Wolcott, and recited figures to show that the statement first made was correct.

            The Committee amendment was agreed to by yeas 31, nays 10. Mr. TURNER moved to strike
              out $16,000 to cover the expense of the Agricultural and Horticultural Reports and all
              that refers to printing these reports.

            Mr. HANNA insisted that if the public printing were all let to the lowest bidder it
              would be well to make such an amendment, but as we have elected a Public Printer these
              documents should be printed by him-The amendment was rejected.

            The committee amendment, proposing an appropriation for building a boiler room at the
              Northern State Prison, being read-

            Mr. GIFFORD gave reasons which governed him in moving to strike it out.

            The motion was rejected.

            The amendments of the Committee of the Whole reducing the amount
              of the contingent expenses for the Secretary of State and Superintendent of Public
              Instruction, from $1,000 to $500, were rejected, as was also the committee amendment
              requiring of the Governor an itemized statement of the expenditure of the contingent
              fund for 1870; and similar amendments to the appropriation for contingent funds of the
              Attorney General and Judges of the Supreme Court and Auditor of State.

            Mr. CARSON saw no necessity of passing a special bill for the purpose, moved to add a
              section appropriate $60,000 for expenses of the present session of the General
              Assembly.

            Mr. WALCOTT moved to lay the amendment on the table.

            The motion was rejected by yeas 21, nays 24.

            Mr. BELLAMY opposed the amendment for the reason that it is intimated Senators are
              desiring to get their mileage and pay and go home without doing the business of the
              State.

            Mr. FISHER suggested that we pass this bill as it is, and then take up the bill from
              the House making this specific appropriation, and pass it.

            Mr. CARSON, with that understanding withdrew his amendment.

            Mr. STEIN moved to reconsider the vote striking out the appropriation for continuing
              the military claim agency.

            The motion was rejected by yeas 20, nays 24.

            Mr. KINLEY moved to add a section appropriating $1,000 to each of the State Prisons
              for the purchase of a prison library.

            The motion was agreed to.

            The bill, as amended, was then read by sections.

            Mr. WOLCOTT offered an amendment for incidental expenses of the Auditor of State for
              1869 the sum of $1,000.The amendment was agreed to.

            The amendments were ordered engrossed.

            And then the Senate took a recess till 2 o'clock. 
          
          

          
            AFTERNOON SESSION.

             Mr. ROBINSON, of Madison, moved that the special order for this hour-the election
              bill [H. R. 23] be read the third time now, and
              upon that motion he demanded the previous question.

            The demand was seconded; and the bill was read and finally passed the Senate by yeas
              26, nays 18.

            On his further motion-yeas 26, nays 17 the bill, H.
                R. 140, to repeal certain sections of the Registry Law, was read the third
              time.

            Mr. HANNA moved to strike out all that portion of the bill which requires the
              numbering of the ballot by the Inspector. He read from the Constitution to show that
              this clause was in direct conflict with that instrument.

            Mr. ROBINSON, of Madison, knew of no better way to protect fraud in elections, and
              did not believe the Constitution would countenance fraud, or bar us from taking steps
              against it.

            Mr. BRADLEY did not know that he could add anything to the remarks of Mr.  Hanna, which he endorsed most heartily. He hoped the
              amendment would be adopted.

            Mr. BELLAMY was of the opinion that if the amendments were adopted there would be no
              protection against fraud in our elections.

            Mr. HOWK considered the provisions of his bill in direct conflict with the
              Constitution of the State, and that it would be void under the decision of any fair
              minded judge.

            Mr. CHURCH denied that this bill was in violation of the Constitution, and supported
              its provisions.

            Mr. SMITH favored the amendment, and opposed the bill.

            Mr. HOOPER opposed the amendment and favored the passage of the bill. He believed it
              would tend to protect the purity of the ballot box, and that it did not conflict with
              the Constitution.

            Mr. CARSON considered this bill as going beyond reason. It was a bill to expose the
              ballot box, and in that respect clearly unconstitutional. It is doing a great evil to
              remedy an evil that is only anticipated.

            Mr. SCOTT knew of no constitutional provision requiring the ballot to be secret.

            Mr. HANNA referred to the law in operation for many years past which punished the
              marking of election tickets so as to find out what person's cast them. If this
              bill were passed, an inspector would be liable to punishment for numbering ballots,
              and could not be screened under an unconstitutional act of the General Assembly.

            The amendment was rejected by yeas 14, nays 24.

            The bill was referred to the Judiciary Committee.

            Mr. RICE offered an amendment, which was referred with the bill, requiring the ballot
              box, after the votes are counted, to be locked, sealed and deposited in the Auditors
              office.

            On motion by Mr. ROBINSON, of Madison, the bill [H. R. 178] amending section 5 of the
              Township Business act, prescribing the election of Township Trustees, annually was
              read the second time, and referred to the Committee on
              Elections.

            On motion of Mr. HOWK, the House amendments to the Criminal Court bill [S. 110] were concurred in.

            On motion by Mr. HANNA the bill [H. R. 65]
              amending section 15 of the act for the incorporation of manufacturing and mining
              companies was read the second time and the Corporations Committee
              amendment agreed to.

            On his further motion the constitutional restriction was dispensed with, and the bill
              read the third time and finally passed the Senate by yeas 41, nays 0.

            On motion by Mr. BELLAMY the bill [H. R. 297] for the relief of Nicholas Moreback, of
              Ripley county, was read the second time by title, again by sections, and finally
              passed the Senate under a dispensation of the constitutional restriction by yeas 35,
              nays 9.

            On motion, the bill [H. R. 179] repealing section 1 of the constable election act of
              1852, and providing for their biennial election, was read the second time, and
              referred to the Committee on Elections.

            On motion by Mr. GREENE, the bill [S. 295] authorizing the assessment of lands for
              plank and gravel road purposes, was read the third time and passed, by yeas 32, nays
              7.

            On motion by Mr. JAQUESS the House resolution for a joint convention tomorrow noon to
              elect a Director of the Southern State Prison was concurred in.

            On motion by Mr. Scott the bill [H. R. 333]
              making an appropriation of $60,000 for expenses of the special session of the 46th
              General Assembly was read the second and and third times and finally passed by yeas
              34, nays 5, under a dispensation of the constitutional restriction.

            On motion by Mr. HADLEY, in was-

            ORDERED: That when the Senate adjourns, it adjourn till nine
              o'clock to-morrow.

            On motion by Mr. RICE the bill [H. R. 34] to
              enable incorporated towns to make public improvements therein, &c., was read the
              second time and passed to the third reading.

            And the Senate adjourned. 
          
          

        
        

        
          HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.

          Leaves of absence for the day, were obtained for Mr. McGregor, Mr. Tabor and Mr.

          The SPEAKER laid before the House a communication from the Governor, responding to the
            resolution of the House, calling for a report of pardons and reprieves executed by him.
            His Excellency refers to a former report, for information, of December 31, 1868, and

            RAILROAD ASSESSMENTS.

             The SPEAKER laid before the House a communication from the Governor transmitting a
              letter from the Auditor of State State in relation to the appraisement for taxations
              of railroad property - submitting the form and recommending the passage of a bill for
              correction of the evils complained of, by so amending the law that the lines of
              railroads shall be separately appraised.

            The communication was referred to the Committee on Ways and
              Means.

            Mr. NEFF (by consent) introduced the proposition just communicated by the Governor,
              entitled a bill [H. R. 368] supplemental to the act passed December, 1865, for the

              Committee. 
          
          

          
            EXECUTIVE PARDONS.

             The SPEAKER laid before the House a farther communication from the Governor,
              reporting his pardons and reprieves from December 31, 1868, to April 1, 1869, which
              was read.

            Mr. WELBORN suggested that it be laid on the table.

            Mr. McFADIN moved that it be printed. It was information that ought to go to the
              people.

            Mr. PIERCE, of Vigo, thought the House would be astonished when looking over this
              report and seeing the number of pardons that have been granted in the last few years.
              He found here (from the report in his hand) that since the first of January - from the
              first of January to the first of April, 1869, there have been thirty-five pardons
              granted by the Governor. He would prefer to let this matter rest without action for
              the present.

            Mr. WELBORN'S motion prevailed, and it was laid on the table. 

            Mr. HAMILTON submitted the following:

            It was adopted.

            CRIMINAL COURTS FOR FLOYD AND CLARK.

             Mr. OVERMYER (by consent), from the Committee on Organization of Courts, re-  turned the bill [S. 110] creating the Twenty-fifth Judicial Circuit, etc., [authorizing
              Criminal Courts for the county of Floyd and the countyof Clark;] with amendments,
              making it the "Twenty-sixth" instead of the "Twenty-fifth"
              Circuit, etc.

            Mr. STEWART, of Clark, said we have but yesterday passed a bill creating the
              Twenty-sixth Circuit, composed of the counties of Union, Franklin, Dearborn and
              Ohio.

            On motion of Mr. DAVIS, of Floyd, the amendment as to the number of the circuit was

            Mr. NEFF moved that its consideration be postponed till the llth of May. [Laughter.]
              It was so ordered.

              received.

              other lands belonging to the trust funds of the State of Indiana, and legalizing all
              deeds transferring such lands.

            INFANTS IN COTTON MILLS.

             Mr. WILLIAMS of Union's, bill [H.B. 285] was taken up, it being the special
              order for this day, proposing to allow infants to be worked eleven hours a day in the
              cotton and woolen factories of the State-the question being on Mr. Stewart of Ohio
              & amendment to make it eight hours a day.

            Mr. KERCHEVAL took the floor in opposition to the bill, stating that he believed it
              was introduced here in the interest of a single cotton factory located in his section
              of the State. It had been said that this bill was copied from the Rhode Island
              statute. He believed that Rhode Island was alone among all the States in legalizing
              the employment of infants more than ten hours a day, unless they are over eighteen
              years of age. In some States it was an offense for parents to consent to such inhuman
              working of their children. He spoke here in the interests of humanity; and held that,
              herein the Legislature should stand as guardian of the children of the State.

            Mr. WILE also spoke against the bill, because it discriminates between the woollen
              and cottton manufacturing interests, and other manufacturing interests; and as to the
              other provision, changing the time of employment from ten to eleven hours, he was
              utterly opposed to it. With regard to the provision requiring that infants shall not
              be employed more than nine months in the year, he insisted that it will fall short of
              attaining the end desired.

            Mr. McFADIN replied to Mr. Wile; and rehearsed additional considerations against the
              bill. He read an extract from a report by a committee of the Legislature of
              Massachusetts, setting forth the hardness of the servitude of children in the numerous
              factories of that State. He alleged that there was no provision in this bill which
              required any parties to send their factory children to school during their proposed
              three months exemption from employment in the factories. He closed with an earnest
              appeal for the rejection of the bill.

            Mr. BRECKINRIDGE, believing that labor should be allowed to regulate itself without
              regard to legislation, moved that the bill be indefinitely postponed.

            The motion was rejected-yeas 38, nays 43.

            Mr. STEWART, of Rush, regarded the  question
              gravely, in figures, showing that the hours, which the bill provides for labor for
              these persons in the year are not so many as the number of hours that they are worked
              under the existing law by 546 hours. Therefore, he concluded that the bill might be
              regarded as so much more favorable to the physical and intellectual development of the
              youths to be affected by it.

            Mr. RUDDELL conceded conscientious action on the part of the opposers of the bill. As
              for himself, he did not propose to legislate in the interests of any class. He would
              legislate in the interests of the State. He would not legislate for class or sect, but
              for all. The Constitution prohibits class legislation, yet the legislation of the
              State has discriminated against the manufacturers contemplated in this bill. And he
              showed the blighting effect of such legislation. On the general prosperity of the
              State. Having an inland State, we ought to look to those interests which we may most
              readily and certainly develope. He would cast his vote for the encouragement, the
              developement and protection of the manufacturing interests of the State.

            Mr. STEWART, of Ohio, replied to the speech of Mr. Stewart, of Rush, showing that the
              bill does not provide that those employed children shall be sent to school.

            Mr. STEWART, of Rush, read from the bill the clause which forbids the employment of
              such children as have not been sent three months to school within the last nine
              months.

            Mr. STEWART, of Ohio. That would only keep certain children out of
              employment-children who do not go to school. He also replied to Mr. Ruddell. He then
              showed that the argument for the bill can not stand. He would not weigh the interests
              of manufacturers or any material interest against the interests of humanity, and he
              showed how the latter better deserves the protection of law. He defended his amendment
              to reduce the term of labor to eight hours a day. When he had concluded-

            Mr. GREENE demanded the previous question, and under it pressure-

            Mr. Stewart of Ohio s amendment was rejected, yeas 34, nays 50, and the question then
              recurred on the adoption of Mr. Kercheval s amendment, striking out "eleven"
              and inserting "ten" in lieu, the vote resulting - yeas 63, nays 23-as

                    Williams of Union, Zenor, Zollars and Mr. Speaker-23.
                
              
            

            So the amendment was adopted.

            Mr. WILE proposed to amend the bill by inserting appropriately: "and in every
              other shop, factory or place where such minors are employed," and inserting a
              clause repealing laws conflicting, etc.

            On the motion of Mr. RUDDELL, the subject was now indefinitely postponed. 
          
          

          
            SHERIFFS' MILEAGE.

             On motion of Mr. FULLER, his bill H. B. 53]
              relative to sheriffs' mileage carrying convicts to the State prisons, was taken
              up, with the committee amendment proposing mileage for conveying female convicts by
              the usually traveled route.

            Mr. PIERCE of Porter, moved to amend, so as to make the distance for the travel of
              the Porter county Sheriff' from Valparaiso to the Michigan City Prison
              "forty miles," instead of "22."

            The amendment was agreed to.

            Mr. VATER proposed to amend by giving the Marion county Sheriff 154 miles, which was
              also adopted.

            Mr. COFFROTH proposed 145 miles for that part of the bill which relates to Huntington
              county; which was also adopted.

            Mr. DITTEMORE proposed 127 miles for Owen county, which was also adopted.

            Mr. GORDON proposed 142 miles for Boone coounty, which was adopted.

            Mr. FIELD, of Lake, proposed 65 miles for Lake county, which was adopted.

            Mr. COTTON proposed 103 miles for Whitley county, which was adopted.

            Mr. McFADIN proposed 85 miles for Cass county, which was agreed to.

            Mr. ODELL proposed 100 miles for the county of Shelby, which was agreed to.

            Mr. LAMBORN praposed 105 miles for Benton county, which was adopted.

            Mr. OVERMYER proposed 75 miles for Jennings caunty, which was adopted.

            Mr. SMITH proposed 111 miles for Wabash county, which was adopted.

            Mr. CUNNINGHAM proposed 140 miles for Fountain county, which was adopted.

            Mr. MILES proposed 197 miles for Sullivan county, which was adopted.

            Mr. NEFF proposed 144 1/2 miles for Putnam county, which was rejected.

            Mr. WILLSON moved to lay the bill on the table, which he withdrew to avoid the demand
              for the yeas and nays.

            

            Mr. McFADIN proposed eighty miles for Cass county, which was adopted.

            Mr. PEIRCE showed that there is necessity for the bill to pass, to prevent unlawful
              charges for Sheriffs' mileage.

            And then under pressure of the previous questions, the bill was ordered to the
              engrossment, considered as engrossed, and passed the final reading-yeas 76, nays
              1.

            The House then adjourned. 
          
          
          
          
        
        

        
          IN SENATE.

          
             FRIDAY, April 23, 1869.
          

          The Senate met at 9 o'clock A. M.

          On motion by Mr. ROBINSON, of Madison, the reading of the Secretary's minutes of
            yesterday was dispensed with. 

          
            GENERAL APPROPRIATION BILL.

             On motion by Mr. WOLCOTT, the bill [H. R.
              309] making general appropriations for the years 1869-70, was read the third
              time.

            Mr. WOLCOTT asked and obtained unanimous consent to offer amendments allowing pay to
              the Judges and Prosecuting Attorneys of the newly created districts.

            The amendments were agreed to.

            The bill, as amended, finally passed the Senate by yeas 32, nays 11.

            Mr. WOLCOTT offered a resolution authorizing the President of the Senate to certify
              for pay of members from the first day of the session.

            This was an embarrassing question, and to relieve the President of the Senate
              therefrom, Mr. Wolcott thought the Senate should take the responsibility.

            The resolution was adopted by yeas 29, nays 12.

            On motion by Mr. WOLCOTT, the bill [H. R. 311]
              making specific appropria-for the year 1869 was taken up, and the reading
              commenced, when-

            On motion of Mr. GRAY, it was read the second time by title, and, with papers
              submitted by Mr. Green and Mr. Robinson of Madison, referred to the Committee
                on Finance. 

            On motion by Mr. BELLAMY, all Senate bills on the second reading were read by title,
              and referred to appropriate committees, viz: S. 326
                to 335 inclusive.

            The bill [S. 336] authorizing the Governor, in certain cases, to remove States Prison
              Directors, was read by title only, and passed to the third reading.

            The bill [S. 337] allowing the Governor to
              draw on the Treasury to continue the benevolent institutions when the Legislature
              fails to make the appropriations therefor, was read the second time by title, and
              again, under a dispensation of the Constitutional provision, and passed the Senate by
              yeas 39, nays 2, with an amendment of title.

            Mr. SCOTT called up the special order viz, his bill [S. 45] allowing $3,500 salary to
              Supreme Judges, $2,500 to Circuit and Criminal Judges, $2,000 to Common Pleas Judges,
              $800 to Circuit and Criminal Prosecuting Attorneys, and $400 to Common Pleas
              Prosecutors.

            It was again read, and passed the Senate by yeas 26, nays 14, with an amendment of
              title-Mr. RICE failing to obtain unanimous consent to reduce the salaries of all
              Prosecuting Attorneys to $400.

            On motion by Mr. FISHER his bill [S. 220] authorizing parties losing money Or
              property at gaming to recover the same, was read the third time and passed by yeas 31,
              nays 8.

            Mr. HANNA suggested it should be titled "a bill to enable a man who has done a
              mean act to do a meaner one."

            Mr. Fisher's bill [S. 258] to allow partnerships to bring and maintain suits in
              their adopted names in certain cases, was read the third time, on his motion, stating
              that he knew of no case in which it would apply, except the Wabash and Erie Canal
              Company, and its main object was to enable that Company to sue parties indebted to
              them.

            Mr. ARMSTRONG favored its passage.

            The bill passed the Senate by yeas 39, nays 1.

            A standing committee returned the bill [H. R.
                97] concerning the correction of County Auditors' reports to the
              Superintendent of Public Instruction, reporting that they considered it
              unconstitutional.

            Mr. FISHER'S bill [S. 261] to allow trustees to erect buildings for municipal
              purposes on docks and wharves, was read the third time en his motion; Mr. Fisher
              stating that he did not know that this bill would be operative anywhere but in Peru
              and another town in his district situated upon the Wabash & Erie Canal,
              &c.

            It was passed the Senate by yeas 39, nays 2.

            Mr. Church's bill [S. 230] to amend section four of the act authorizing the sale
              of the Governor's residence and to provide a Governor's residence, &c.,
              was read the third time.

            After debate by Messrs. HANNA, CARSON, CRAVENS, CHURCH and TURNER, the former and the
              two latter particularly objecting to the Governor's living in a house the rental
              of which does not exceed $1,000, while the State is paying $5,000 to him for the
              purpose of renting a house suitable to his position as Chief Executive of a great
              State. If the State pays that officer $9,000 or $10,000 a year, it is desirable that
              the fact should go abroad, instead of the
              statement that the Governor gets a salary of but $3,000.

            Mr. FISHER insisted that Senators were indirectly increasing their own pay by voting
              themselves stamps, &c., and therefore, inconsistent in objecting to raising the
              too small salary of the Governor in a similar way.

            Mr. RICE did not think that the Governor had ever read this law of 1865 or he would
              not have drawn $5,000 for house rent when he pays out only about $1,000 for that
              purpose. A prominent trait in his character was to see corruption wherever it might
              appears in his horizen; and he certainly had no right to draw but $1,000 of this
              $5,000 appropriation.

            The hour of 12 having arrived-

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR announced that Senators would not repair to the Hall of the
              House, pursuant to a concurrent resolution of yesterday, for the purpose of electing a
              Director of the State Prison South.

            When Senators returned to their Chamber -

            The Senate took a recess until 2 o'clock P. M.
            
          
          

          
            AFTERNOON SESSION.

             Mr. HOOPER, being of the opinion that it was establishing a bad precedent to take up
              matters disposed of last session, moved to suspend the order of besiness, so that the
              vote of this morning, taking from the table the pending bill, [S. 230], may be
              reconsidered.

            The motion was rejected, by yeas 18, nays 23.

            Mr. CRAVENS made an ineffectual motion-yeas 19, nays 22-to lay it on the table.

            Mr. FOSDICK demanded the previous question, and there being a second, under its
              operation-

            The bill was passed the Senate by yeas yeas 27, nays 14. 


          
            THE BAKER-CUMBACK CORRESPONDENCE.

             Mr. RICE, by leave, offered the following resolution:

            Resolved, That the resolutions of the Senate in relation to the
              correspondence of Lieutenant Governor Cumback with Governor Baker, and the proceedings
              of the Senate in relation thereto, be expunged from the Jurnal ef the Senate, and that
              the Secretary of the Senate be directed to write across the face of said resolutions
              and proceedings : "Expunged by order of the Senate."

            After remarks for and against considering the resolution at this time by Messrs.
              Rice, Turner, Carson, Hanna, Wolcott, Fisher, Bradley and Hooper-

            On motion of Mr. HANNA, the consideration of the resolution was postponed and made
              the special order for Tuesday next at 2 o'clock P. M. 
          
          

          
            DRAINAGE OP WET LANDS.

             On motion by Mr. BRADLEY, the bill [S. 134]
              to encourage the construction of levees, dikes and drains, and the reclamation of wet
              and overflowed lands, was read the third time.

            Mr. FISHER disliked a provision in this bill which repeals all other laws on the
              subject. It is gotten up for the purpose of draining the Kankakee country-about one
              million acres of land now worthless-but he would not oppose the bill were it not for
              the obnoxious provision referred to.

            Mr. BRADLEY insisted that this bill was much better than the old law, and could be
              applied to a small job as well as a large one.

            Mr. WOLCOTT expressed most serious objections to the bill. It probably affects from
              three to five millions of acres of land. It gives irresponsible persons the power of
              fraud, etc., and where is the remedy for irregularity?

            Mr. GREEN named other objections, but notwithstanding would vote for the bill.

            Mr. BRADLEY demanded the previous question, and the demand being seconded by the
              Senate-under its operation-

            The bill was passed by-yeas 34; nays 5.

            Mr. WOLCOTT gave notice that on tomorrow he should move to reconsider this vote. 
          
          

          
            CITY SCHOOL HOUSES.

             Mr. Fosdicks bill [S. 122] supplemental to the act of March 11, 1867, authorizing
              cities to sell bonds to erect and complete unfinished school buildings, was read the
              second time and passed the Senate, by yeas 31, nays 9. 
          
          

          
            INCORPORATED COMPANIES.

             Mr. JAQUESS' bill [S. 167] to amend section 4 of the act of May 20, 1852, for
              the incorporation of manufacturing and mining companies, was read the third time, and
              passed the Senate by yeas 38, nays 0. 
          
          

          
            WITNESSES.

             Mr. HOOPER'S bill [S. 175] defining who shall be competent witnesses in any
              court in this State, was read the third time.

            Mr. HOOPER explained: The bill provides that the wife may be a competent witness as
              to her own property; permits both parties in administrators' suits to testify;
              and strikes out the last proviso in the law of 1867.

            Mr. HANNA declared that this bill would uproot the rules of evidence that have
              obtained in precedents for five hundred years; and hoped it would not pass.

            Mr. CARSON also opposed this innovation.

            Mr. HOOPER said the bill-proposed to repeal a provision now on the statute book that
              is an innovation upon the practice for 
              centuries; and he urged the passage of the bill.

            Mr. TURNER demanded the previous question, which was sustained by the Senate.

            Under its operation the bill was passed by yeas 28, nays 12. 
          
          

          
            BILLS PASSED.

             On motion by Mr. TURNER (for Mr. Lee) the Constitutional restriction was dispensed
              with, and the bill [H. R. 214,] supplemental to
              the act of March 5, 1859, authorizing the incorporation of purchasers of roads, was

            The bill [S. 191,] to enable cities to keep in repair roads leading to cemeteries,

            On motion by Mr. MORGAN the bill [H. R. 90)
              creating the 25th Judicial Circuit )Vanderburg Criminal Court) was carried to the
              final reading and passed the Senate by yeas 34, nays 2, under a dispensation of the
              constitutional restriction; with an amendment of title "creating the 28th and
              29th Judicial Circuit" including the county of Jefferson and establishing a
              criminal court therein.

            The bill (H. R. 34) to enable incorporated
              towns to make improvements therein, &c., was read the third time and passed the
              Senate by yeas 34, nays 3.

            The bill [H. R. 72] defining what counties
              shall constitute the Fifth Judicial Circuit, was read the third time and passed by
              yeas 33, nays 4.

             Mr. SMITH, by leave, introduced a bill [S.
                338] defining what counties shall constitute the Tenth Judicial District, was
              read the first time.

            Mr. CHURCH offered a resolution, which was adopted, appointing a committee of three
              Senators to act with a House committee in inspecting the cabinet of the late Dr. D. D.
              Owen, with a view to purchasing the same.

            And then the Senate adjourned till 9 o'clock to-morrow-under the rules. 
          
          
          
          
        
        

        
          HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.

           Mr. FULLER presented a claim. 

          
            REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.

             Mr. JOHNSTON, of Parke, from the Judiciary Committee, returned
              his bill [H. R. 358] in relation to City Judges, recommending its indefinite
              postponement. He also reported Mr. Dittemore's bill [H. R. 346] to repeal section
              2 of the "Provoke Law," recommending its indefinite postponement.

            Mr. FIELD of Lake, from the same comittee, returned Mr. Pierce of Vigo's bill
              [H. R. 372] to make extortion a misdemeanor, etc. He also returned Mr. Neff's
              bill [H. R. 367] to make the wife a competent witness in certain cases, recommend
              their indefinite postponement.

            Mr. DAVIS of Floyd, from the same committee, returned Mr. Monroe's per diem and
              mileage of members bill [H. R. 306] recommending its indefinite postponement. He also
              returned Mr. Gordon s bill [H. R. 320] to limit the allowances of Courts and Boards,
              recommending its indefinite postponement.

            Mr. DUNN, from the same committee returned a bill from the Senate; also Mr.
              McDonald's bill [H. R. 85] to make Michigan road land records evidence,

            FIFTEENTH ARTICLE AMENDMENT.

             Mr. PIERCE, of Vigo, from a majority of the Committee on
                Elections, reported on the petition presented yesterday by Mr. Coffroth,
              from 2,000 citizens of the counties of Ohio and Switzlerland, for instructions to
              their Senator and Representative to oppose the ratification of the fifteenth amendment
              proposed to the Constitution of the United States or resign. The report recites the
              article of the general Constitution providing for amendments thereof, and alleges that
              the proceedings in relation to the proposed fifteenth amendment have been regular; and
              that the proposition for submission to the people is unknown to the Constitution; and
              it concludes with the expression of opinion that the said petitioners should not
              interpose authoritatively in cases where the oath of their Representatives are
              involved.

            On motion of Mr. ZOLLERS, it was laid on the table.

            Mr. OSRORN, from the Committee on Education, returned Mr.
              Cunningham's bill to amend sections 1, 25, and 33 of the Common School law (for
              changing the pay of certian school officers) recommending its indefinite
              postponement.

            Mr. MITCHELL, from the Committee on Fees and Salaries, returned
              Mr. Dunn's bill [H. R. 233] for amending the law regulating the fees of certain
              officers-Surveyors-recommending its indefinite postponement.

            These reports for indefinite postponement were severally concurred in.

            Mr. BRECKINRIDGE, from the Committee on Rights and Privileges,
              returned his bill [H. R. 328,] for registrations of births and deaths, recommending
              its indefinite postponement.

            Mr. COFFROTH considered that this bill has good features. It is a matter which
              frequently becomes of the highest importance to
              parties in reference to questions of identity. The country is growing, and property is
              becoming very valuable, and something of this character is eminently fit and
              proper.

            Mr. MITCHELL. The late war has given rise to many claims against the Government for
              pensions and bounties, and I have found it very difficult, in numerous cases, to get
              the necessary proof to establish the claims of minor heirs.

            Mr. BRECKINRIDGE. It was the opinion of the committee that the bill imposed onerous
              duties on the Township Assessors, and it imposes penalties on ministers of the gospel
              and others who may solemnize marriages, if they fail to report to the Assessor. The
              committee were unable to see in what sense it could do any good. The institutions of
              our country differ entirely from those of the old country, There every man is bound to
              do military duty, and every child is born a member of the church, etc.

            The House refused to concur in the recommendation of the report to indefinitely
              postpone the bill - affirmative, 27; negative, 45.

            On motion of Mr. PIERCE, of Porter, the bill was then referred to the
                Committee on the Judiciary. 
          
          

          
            PAY OF MEMBERS.

             Mr. STEWART, of Rush, submitted a preamble and resolution (which was adopted),
              reciting the facts that the present extra session was called to convene on the 8th,
              and was organized on the 12th of April instant; and authorizing the Speaker to draw
              his warrants for the pay of members from the 8th instant inclusive.

            Mr. MILLER, from the Committee on Mileage and Accounts, submitted
              a report assigning the mileage of the several members of the House of
              Repretentatives.

            Mr. PIERCE, of Vigo, said it was precisely the same as that which was adopted at the
              regular session.

            The report was adopted.

            Mr. NEFF, from the Committee on Corporations, returned Mr.
              Hall's bill [H. R. 197] legalizing the Acts of Township Trustees, recommending
              its indefinite postponement, which was concurred in.

            Numerous favorable reports from the several committees were laid on the table,
              without further action, till they shall come up in order. 
          
          

          
             GENERAL APPROPRIATION BILL.

             On motion of Mr. STEWART, of Rush, the order of business was suspended for the
              consideration of the General Appropriation bill [H.
                R. 309.]

            On motion of Mr. CHITTENDEN, the House resolved itself into a Committee of
                the Whole for the consideration of said bill-

            Mr. STANTON in the Chair.

            And after some time spent therein, the Commitee rose, and-

            The CHAIRMAN reported the bill back with sundry amendments to the amendments proposed
              thereto by the Senate.

            Mr. CORY moved to amend by striking out $5,000 for the boiler room and engine house
              for the Michigan City Prison, and inserting $1,000 in lieu.

            After debate by Messrs. PIERCE of DAVIDSON, and FIELD, of Lake, showing the necessity
              for this appropriation; by Mr. BARRETT, giving the reason why the Prison Committee did
              not report in favor of this improvement; by Mr. WILDMAN,who was satisfied that $5,000
              is too much, and proposing to make it $2,000; by Mr. JOHNSTON of Parke, in favor of
              the appropriation as in the bill"$5,000, or so much thereof as may be
              necessary."

            Mr. NEFF demanded the previous question-

            Mr. CORY accepted Mr. Wildman's proposition to make it $2,000.

            The yeas and nays on the adoption of the amendment resulted-yeas 50, nays 36, as
              follows:

            
              
                
                  YEAS-Messrs. Addison, Admire, Barritt, Bates, Beatty,
                    Beeler, Carnahan, Cave, Gory, Cotton, Cunningham, Davidson, Davis of Elkhart,

                    Lamborn, Mason, Millekan, Miller, Miner, Odell, Osborn, Palmer. Pierce of
                    Porter, Pierce of Vigo, Ratliff, Ruddell, Sabin, Skidmore, Sleeth, Stanton,
                    Stewart of Ohio, Stewart of Rush, Taber, Underwood, Vardeman, Williams of St.
                    Joseph, Williams of Union, and Mr. Speaker-36.
                
              
            

            Mr. LAMBORN, explaining, I wish to say to the House that one thousand dollars will
              not take the boilers out of the budding. Then what kind of a building can you
              construct for one thousand dollars?

            Mr. RUDDELL explained, He had at his room an estimate made by a competent mechanic,
              setting forth the plan of these improvements; and there it is estimated that upwards
              of five thousand dollars would be necessary just for the construction of the building,
              leaving nothing for the expense of removing to present boiler. All the buildings for
              this Northern Prison are of the most substantial character.

            Mr. STANTON, explaining. I shall vote "no" on this amendment, for the
              reason that I have no idea that two thousand dollars will be sufficient for the
              proposed building. There must be iron frames for the roof. He respected the
              recommendations and estimates of the Directors
              and Warden, who are men of reputation.

            Mr. VATER explained. I am very well satisfied that if ten thousand dollars were
              appropriated it would all be expended on the building, if it were necessary to make it
              of polished marble. I know what architects say in such cases: Of course if it is
              appropriated it is expected that it will be expended. And I say that two hundred or
              two hundred and fifty dollars will do the brick-work, and that six to eight hundred
              dollars will build the chimney. I find then that it will leave four or five hundred
              dollars to remove the boiler, &c. Therefore I vote aye.

            Mr. WILDMAN explained. He hoped none would consider that, by making this motion, he
              wished to cast any reflection on the officers of the Northern Prison. The Warken is
              very anxious to have the Northern Prison second to none in the United States. The
              reason he objected to the five thousand dollars is, because he conceived that these
              gentlemen desire a finer building than the necessity of the case demands.

            So the amenement was adopted, and the item changed to two thousand dollars.

            After debate on the order, the report, of the Committee of the
                Whole, as amended, was adopted. 
          
          

          
            THOS. C. M'COWN, DOORKEEPER.

             Mr. OSBORN, from the Committee on Employes, reported that said
              committee having inquired into the charges alleged against Thos. C. McCown, find no
              evidence to sustain them, and asked to be discharged. The committee also reported the
              evidence to the House.

            Mr. PIERCE, of Vigo. Understanding that this committee have given this matter a
              patient investigation, and that there is not a scintilla of evidence to sustain the
              charges, I move that the report be concurred in.

            The motion was agreed to.

            Mr. HAMILTON submitted the following, which was adopted:

            
              
                
                   WHEREAS, Thomas C. McCoun, Doorkeeper of this House has
                    been arraigned before the House on charges of corruption and bribery in the
                    distribution of his appointments; and,

                   WHEREAS, The Committee of Investigation,
                    raised by the House to investigate said charges, has found them wholly without
                    foundation; therefore,

                  
                    Resolved That said Thomas G. McCoun, said Doorkeeper, is
                    entitled to the Confidence and respect of this House. 
                
              
            

             The House took a recess to prepare for the Joint Convention appointed for 12
              o'clock M. 
          
          

          
            IN JOINT CONVENTION.

             The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR announced the authority for the convention of the two
              Houses, to choose a Director for the Southern Prison, and the order nominations.

            Mr. Representative HAMILTON nominated Robert S. Heiskell. 

            Mr. Representative LAWLER nominated James Keigwin.

            The vote resulted as follows

            Mr Heiskell received................................73 votes

            Mr Keigwin received........................48 votes.

            Mr. Heiskell, having received a majority, was declared to be duly elected.

            Mr. OSBORN asked for the reading of the following letter, for information of the
              Joint Convention, as matter pertinent to the interests of the Southern Prison.


            
              
                
                  
                  
                     CORYDON, IND., April 20, 1869.
                    Governor Baker, Indianapolis,
                      Indiana:
                  

                  DEAR SIR : I have been informed by my
                    friend Mr. Nixon, that certain parties at Indianapolis, in view of the fact that
                    some of my friends have named me in connection with the position of Director of
                    the Southern Prison, have stated that Colonel Merriweather, late Warden, in his
                    testimony before the recent Legislative Committee, raised to investigate the
                    management of that institution, swears that Governor Morton, with myself and
                    other Republicans of the Second District, induced Mr. Donaldson, a former
                    Director, to resign for a consideration; and that I and one Judge B. (who is
                    meant I do not know,) raised $2,000 for Donaldson. I do not know whether Colonel
                    Merriweather has made this statement or not, but whether made by him, or anybody
                    else, on oath or otherwise, so far as it involves me, it is utterly false, and
                    without the shadow of a foundation in truth. I do not remember certainly ever to
                    have met Mr. Donalson, but think I did have a formal introduction to him at the
                    Bates House in January, 1865. If so, the interview did not last over a minute,
                    and was confined to the ordinary courtesies of such an occasion. I never
                    communicated with him directly or indirectly on the subject of his resignation -
                    never contributed one farthing myself, nor asked nor advised any one else to
                    contribute a farthing, for any such purpose, and had no knowledge that money was
                    paid him to secure his resignation. I was informed by a gentleman of Clarke
                    county, a leading Republican, early in 1865, that it was probable that Donaldson
                    would resign, and, in such a contingency, was asked to suggest some one who was
                    honest and qualified as a suitable person to recommend for appointment as his
                    successor. I suggested Samuel J. Wright, Esq., of this place, and my
                    recollection is that I called on Governor Morton, and told him I had been
                    informed that possibly Mr. Donaldson would resign, and if he should do so Mr.
                    Wright's appointment, I believed, would be a good one. Other gentlemen, no
                    doubt, did the same. I imagine this was about all that Governor Morton knew
                    about Donaldson's intended resignation. Donalson did eventually resign, and
                    Mr. Wright's friends again urged and secured his appointment to the vacant
                    place. This was all the agency I had in this whole matter. I am sure I am in no
                    wise ashamed of it, because I believe it is conceded Mr. Wright made an honest
                    and efficient Director. 

                  I trust your Excellency will pardon me for addressing you on a subject so
                    purely personal. I suppose this testimony, if any such exists, has come, or will
                    come, under your observation, and I am unwilling to rest for a moment under an
                    imputation of corruption so utterly without foundation as this is. My purpose is
                    to set myself right with your Excellency, whose good opinion, as well as that of
                    all other honest men, I confess I covet.

                  
                    Very respectfully,
                    Your Obedient Servant,
                    THOMAS C. SLAUGHTER
                  
                
              
            

            

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR then adjourned the convention.

            The SPEAKER resumed the Chair, and -

            The House took a recess till 2 o'clock. 
          
          

          
            AFTERNOON SESSION.
            
            GOVERNOR'S PARDONS AND REPRIEVES.

             Mr STANTON rose to what might be a question of privilege-to correct the statement of
              the gentleman from Vigo, yesterday, with regard to the Governor s pardons since the
              first of January.

            Mr. PIERCE, of Vigo, said he was misunderstood by the reporter. He intended to say
              twenty-five, and he did say twenty-five.

            Mr. STANTON continued. Mr. Pierce, of Vigo, was mistaken yesterday in saying that the
              Governor's report showed 35 pardons granted from January 1, 1869, to April 1,
              1869. The report shows 24 instead of thirty-five pardons granted during that time. Of
              these twenty-four, six were pardoned on the recommendation of the physicians and
              officers of the prisons, to the end that they might die with their friends, each of
              them being afflicted with an incurable disease, which must soon terminate life. Two
              were pardoned because of insanity, certified to by the Prison Physician, and the
              pardons requested by the Directors. One boy was sentenced to the House of Refuge and
              could not be received because that institution was full, and, as he could not be tried
              a second time for the same offence, nor could he be legally imprisoned elsewhere, he
              was, therefore, pardoned.

            A majority of the remaining eleven were convicted of minor offences and had served
              out the principal portion of their time, and by their good conduct had given evidence
              of reformation. 
          
          

          
            TWENTY-EIGHTH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT.

             The SPEAKER announced the special order, viz: Mr. Ruddell s bill [H. R. 341] creating the 25th Judicial Circuit,
              providing for the election of a Judge thereof, etc.

            The Special Committee's substitute therefor was read by the Clerk.

            Mr. OSBORN and Mr. DITTEMORE objected to the subssitute, on account of its
              disposition of Morgan County. 

            Mr. STANTON stated that it was satisfactory to the Marion Representatives, taking out
              Johnson county from their circuit, and giving a better chance for trial before their
              Judge, and it was also satisfactory to the Representative from Morgan county, Mr.
              Mitchell. All he asked was that there might be a chance for the business to be done in
              the Marion Circuit.

            Mr. BARRITT was surprised at this opposition coming from, members outside the
              Circuit.

            Mr. WILSON supported the substitute, as demanded for relief from the pending business
              in Marion county. We should yield our opposition for the general good.

            Mr. OSBORN proposed to amend, by striking out Morgan county, which he briefly
              defended. What he objected to was this formation of a new circuit-this reducing a
              circuit already too small, for the purpose of making another judge-making up a new
              circuit at the expense of older ones.

            Mr. MITCHELL had not been urging, this amendment-substitute on behalf of Morgan
              county, but had consented at the solicitation of members from Marion. He opposed Mr.
              Osborn's amendment, and replied to the considerations upon which it was
              urged.

            On motion of Mr. OVERMEYER, Mr, Osborn's amendment was laid on the table.

            Mr. WILLIAMS of Knox spoke generally against the formation of numerous circuits. The
              judiciary expenses of the State had, in two years increased from $35,000 to
              $76,000.

            Mr. STANTON replied to Mr. Williams and showed the offset of this expense in savings
              in the expense for witnesses and jail fees. We were all anxious to save expense. But
              should we therefore deny the rights of parties before the law? He contended that the
              people have endorsed the creation of new circuits and of criminal courts in our late
              legislation.

            And then, under the force of the previous question, the substitute amendment was
              adopted.

            On motion of Mr. STANTON, the bill was considered as engrossed, and (the
              constitutional restriction being removed for the purpose), the bill was ordered to the
              third reading, read the third time, and passed the House-yeas 66, nays 13-with an
              amendment of title so as to read: An act creating the Twenty-eighth Judicial Circuit,
              etc., (it being composed of the counties of Johnson, Shelby, Morgan, Brown and
              Bartholomew.) 
          
          

          
            TERRE HAUTE RAILROAD.

             Mr. PIERCE, of Vigo (under a suspension) called up Mr. Barnett's bill [H. R. 322] to enable railroad companies to perfect
              their lines by connections, etc., (the special object being to enable the Terre Haute
              and Indianapolis Road to cross the river on the new bridge at Terre Haute,) and it was
              read the second time by title.

            On his further motion, (the constitutional restriction having been removed for the
              purpose) the bill was ordered to the engrossment, considered as engrossed and passed
              the final reading in the House-yeas 78, nays 0. 
          
          

          
            FEES OF COUNTY OFFICERS.

             Mr, Stephenson's bill [H. R. 78] to regu- 
              late the fees of county officers, coming up as the special order, with the substitute
              amendment in the place of the original bill and the amendments, it was read by the
              Clerk.

            Mr. COFFROTH stated that the Special Committee had reported a fee bill, in compliance
              with instructions of the House. It was for the friends of a fee bill, in preference of
              a salary bill.

            Mr. GORDON had taken a stand in the House against a fee bill. This bill would be
              agreeable to his county. But there were counties in the State so small that it might
              not pay those county officers for their time. He feared, however, that, unless we pass
              this bill, or that from the Senate, we will do nothing. Therefore, he should, perhaps
              vote for this bill. Still he thought the Legislature might do better than to pass a
              fee bill; and he thought the Senate bill better than this.

            Mr. STEWART, of Ohio, replied to Mr. Gordon: This amendment came from the hands of
              experienced men, and would be found to meet most of the exigencies complained of. His
              county was one of the smaller class, and he was perfectly satisfied that it would do
              no injustice there. The bill provided against constructive fees. That matter was well
              hedged. The bill provided strictly that the officer shall be paid for the work he
              does, and for do more. He explained its provisions at length, answering
              interrogatories by Mr. Monroe and Mr. McFadin. It was prepared with special reference
              to the importance of guarding against abuses, and not to injure the officials in the
              smaller counties.

            Mr. CORY moved ineffectually to print the bill.

            Mr. KERCHEVAL said the bill changes the items of fees but little from what the law
              now is. The great object of the Committee in revising the fee bill was to provide
              against constructive fees and extravagant allowances by county boards, &c. And
              they had done their work well. He commended particularly the change with regard to the
              fees of County Treasurers diminishing the per centage on larger sums, and increasing
              the per centage for collecting delinquent taxes to ten per cent. This last change
              would increase their vigilance in collections. When we remedy the abuses connected
              with extra allowances (as to Sheriffs, etc.) and those called constructive fees, he
              considered that we would have a very just fee bill.

            Mr. WILDMAN said the committee was composed of one from each Congressional District;
              and he stated how they proceeded in the preparation of this bill-appropriating the
              Sheriffs' fees, the Clerks' fees, and the Auditors' and
              Treasurers' fees to sub-committees of their number. The most commendable change
              with regard to the Treasurers' fees was that restricting his per cent, to a half
              of one per cent on sums collected above fifty thousand dollars.

            Mr. LONG explained the few emendations and restrictions as to the fees of Clerks.

            Mr. CHITTENDEN proposed to amend the amendment so that County Treasurers shall not be
              allowed to charge percentage on collections for gravel road purposes, excepting on
              that portion which is collected in money.

            Mr. MONROE opposed the amendment because it does not meet the difficulty, which
              consists in allowing the County Treasurer to collect for the road corporations-an
              abuse which he proposed to correct by a separate bill for the purpose.

            Mr. NEFF urged action on the bill, and deprecated amendments.

            Mr. OSBORN hoped there would be no further changes made in the bill. He had not seen
              a bill reported from a committee more satisfactory as a whole than this. He believed
              it would be entirely satisfactory to the people.

            On motion of Mr. NEFF, Mr. Chittenden's amendment was laid on the table.

            And under the force of the previous question the Committee's substitute
              amendment was concurred in.

            On motion of Mr. COFFROTH, the bill, as amended, was considered and engrossed,
              ordered to the third reading, and read the third time.

            Mr. WELBORN said the sheriffs were cut down to one per cent, on all sums over $200.
              Then the feeding of prisoners was cut down to 50 cents. These were the only changes
              proposed on the sheriff's fees.

            Mr. McFADIN spoke in general and specific commendation of the bill.

            Mr. COFFROTH obtained unanimous consent to insert a section for a repealing clause,
              and an emergency.

            The bill was finally passed the house of Representatives-yeas 69, nays 15-with an
              amendment of title, viz: "An act regulating the fees of officers and repealing
              former acts in relation thereto, and declaring an emergency."

            On motion of Mr. STEWART, of Rush, the order of business was suspended, for the
              consideration of House bills on the third reading.

            Mr. VATER'S Insane Hospital Appropriation bill was indefinitely postponed-as
              superseded by an item in the general bill. 
          
          

          
            MUNICIPAL BANK SHARES TAX.

             Mr. KERCHEVAL'S Bank Shares Assessment bill [H. R. 170] was taken up.

            Mr. Speaker BUSKIRK (Mr. Neff in the  Chair,)
              took the floor against the bill. This thing could not be done under the decisions of
              the Supreme Court, and under the law authorizing the National Banks, they can not be
              taxed for municipal purposes, except as the State banks are so taxed. And there were
              other objections to the bill. The Constitution provides that all bills providing for a
              tax shall be considered in Committee of the Whole; and this bill has not been so
              considered. It being thus defective, and because it attempts what can not be done
              legally, he hoped it would not be passed. There was already a tax discrimination
              against those interested in the banks furnishing the national currency.

            Mr. McFADIN spoke in defense of the bill and, in reply to Mr. Buskirk, denying that
              there is any law against the taxation of national currency. These national banks being
              located in the cities, it was pertinent and proper that they should pay tax for
              municipal purposes. It had been said that the courts would decide against the bill;
              but let us try it. A similar tax for county and State purposes was passed two years
              ago, and the courts had not disturbed that.

            Mr. VATER was in favor of the principle of the bill. The banks have police
              protection, in the cities, and on that score, they could not plead for exemption from
              taxation. The legal argument against the bill depend upon the laws themselves, and
              there was no constitutional restriction here. And upon the argument of the gentleman
              from Monroe, that these banks can be taxed for municipal purposes only as the State
              banks, the question would still depend on our legislation. Then tax State banks, and
              all alike, under the principle so just and reasonable, upon which this bill proceeds.
              And the act of 1867, to which reference had been made, expressly declares the power to
              tax these banks.

            Mr. JOHNSTON. Unlike other gentlemen, in his zeal to represent the interests of the
              people, he did not overlook the moneyed and other interests. He insisted that the
              clause in the charter of the State Bank, exempting that institution from municipal
              taxation, was in the nature of a contract that could not be revoked. In reply to Mr.
              McFadin, he spoke of the earnings of the National Banks; and he showed that the six
              per cent interest on their deposited bonds, and the limit often per cent, on their
              loans, making but sixteen per cent., instead of thirty-two per cent., as urged by the
              gentlemen. Then these bankers are taxed for state and County tax, on every dollar
              invested, while others pay this tax on hardly more than half what they are worth. The
              banker is taxed on his capital, on his income, and on his privilege to bank. 

            Mr. BUSKIRK interposed the suggestion that they are taxed 4 and 61 hundreths per
              cent-almost double that of any other interest.

            Mr. JOHNSON continued showing the extent and stringency of bank taxation, even their
              currency being liable to taxation-only their stock is exempt from taxation for
              municipal purposes. If banks were taxed to the full value of their stocks, etc., while
              other interests are taxed not more than half their value, it was neither right, nor
              wise, nor just to subject them to be taxed by every petty municipality in the State.
              "He spoke at length of the general ; advantages of banking institutions.

            Mr. ZOLLARS, as a friend of the bill, moved that the further consideration of it be
              postponed and that it be made the special order for Thursday, 10 o'clock.

            The motion was agreed to.

            On motion of Mr. "WILLIAMS, of Knox, the title to the County Officers Fee bill
              [H. R. 78] was amended so as to include these words: "To amend the act entitled
              an act to regulate fees, salaries, &c., approved March, 1855."

            The SPEAKER laid before the House a communication from the Governor, transmitting a
              supplemental report from the Directors of the Northern Prison, embracing the report of
              the Moral Instructor of said Prison. 
          
          

          
            SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS OF THE STATE PRISON
              SOUTH.

            
              
                
                  
                  
                     INDIANA STATE PRISON, SOUTH.  JEFFERSONVILLE,
                        April 6, 1869.
                    To Honorable Conrad Baker :
                  


                  SIR-In view of the Special Session of the Legislature about
                    to convene, and the development of important facts concerning Prison affairs
                    since our last report, we deem it important to present to your consideration the
                    following:

                  The laws of the State confer on the Warden the sole power of making all
                    contracts for Prison supplies, without any limitation or hindrance from the
                    Directors, and hence the latter can never know what are the expenditures or
                    liabilities of the Prison, except from the accounts and statements of the Warden
                    and his Clerk.

                  On this basis, and relying on the correctness of the representations of the
                    late Warden, it was that the Directors, in their Annual Report, declared the
                    Prison to be self-sustaining. But on a thorough examination of the affairs, with
                    the assistance of the new Warden, they regret to find it otherwise.

                  As a specimen of the deceptive figures given them, they would call attention to
                    the fact that the Warden's figures are based on the cash receipts and
                    disbursements, not taking his liabilities or loss on invoices. Indeed he claims
                    an increase of provisions,  etc., when the
                    Clerks tables show a large falling off.

                  A thorough overhauling of accounts show that the total earnings of the Prison
                    for the last year, was fifty-four thousand, two hundred and seventy-three
                    dollars and seventy cents. ($54,273 70,) while the expenditure was sixty-two
                    thousand, two hundred and forty-five dollars and ten cents, ($62,245 10,)
                    showing a deficit of seven thousand nine hundred and severity-one dollars and
                    forty cents, ($7,971 40). Of this amount $4,432 62 cents is chargeable to
                    account of repairs; but there roust be added $1,669 74 cents, of accounts of the
                    late Warden, presented since his resignation, and of which neither Clerk nor
                    Directors had previous knowledge, leaving the real deficit $5,208 52 cents. The
                    number of prisoners reported was 405, showing, that each prisoner cost the State
                    $12 86 cents per year more than is earned.

                  The New York State Prison at Auburn reports to the Legislature a deficiency of
                    $35 00 per man, while in the Sing Sing Prison the deficiency is still greater,
                    being nearly $100,000 to 1,293 convicts. It must be remembered further that 19
                    of our convicts are females, whose labor is not profitably employed. In New York
                    the female department costs $29,500, and earns less than $5,000.

                  We feel compelled to say that the statement in the Annual Report of the Board,
                    that in all probability no extensive repairs would be required for several
                    years, was unadvised. On a thorough examination of the buildings we find the
                    roofs, spouting and other portions in bad condition. In fact, the original
                    construction was defective, and signs of delapidation are apparent in various
                    parts which require immediate attention, or else will involve large future
                    expenditures.

                  We would ask from the Legislature an appropriation of $5,000 for repairs for
                    the current year, and if the members are not satisfied of its necessity we ask
                    them that their Committee on Prisons may be instructed to make a personal
                    examination; that body will of course feel it necessary to make the usual
                    appropriation for unexpected contingencies, which, however, we hope we shall
                    have no occasion to use.

                  We would again call attention to the fact that the number of prisoners in our
                    charge is decreasing. We should be glad to record this fact if it were an
                    evidence of a decrease of crime, but while our numbers are diminished far below
                    the capacity of our prison and workshops, and is one cause of our failure to
                    meet all our current expenses, the number of convicts in the Prison, North, is
                    increasing beyond their means of profitable employment; this is a loss to the
                    State, and can be easily remedied by again transferring Marion county to the
                    South.

                  We also feel it to be our duty to call attention again to the absolute need of
                    a library for the use of the convicts. We would not be importunate, but the
                    honor of the State and the good of the prisoners are equally involved, and we
                    feel that the matter should riot be delayed. The State can not expend a thousand
                    dollars to abettor advantage.

                  
                    All of which is respectfully submitted,
                    W. W. CURRY, F. M. MEREDITH Directors State

             The House then adjourned. 
          
          
          
          
        
        

        
          
          
             SATURDAY, April 24, 1869.
          

          The Senate met at 9 o'clock A. M.

          On motion by Mr. JOHNSON of Spencer, the reading of the Secretary's journal of
            yesterday was dispensed with. 

          
            PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS.

            Mr. FISHER presented a petition with reference to the formation of a new Judicial
              Circuit.

            Mr. JAQUESS presented four petitions with reference to the Morgain raid claims.

            Mr. ANDREWS and Mr. ROBINSON of Decatur, presented similar petitions.

            These petitions were referred to the appropriate committees. 

          
          

          
            REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.

            The bill [S. 311] to authorize counties to build asylums for sick, infirm and insane,
              was returned from the committee with a recommendation that it lie on the table.

            These reports were concurred in. 

          
          

          
            EXTRA ALLOWANCE.

            Mr. GIFFORD offered a resolution, which was adopted, that members of the
                Committee on Prisons be allowed $3 for every twenty-five miles
              traveled in visiting said prisons. 

          
          

          
            RECESS TILL TUESDAY.

            Mr. HENDERSON offered a resolution that when the Senate adjourn it be till Tuesday at
              10 o'clock A. M.

            Mr. HENDERSON and others favored the resolution because many members would leave the
              city before noon; because there would be no quorum after dinner; and because of the
              great Odd Fellows' celebration.

            Mr. GRAY and others opposed. The adjournment over last Saturday and Monday was in
              violation of a constitutional provision, Mr. G. said. It would not be so be to adjourn
              from 5 o'clock this afternoon till Tuesday; but to lose all of to-day and all of
              Monday was too much.

            The resolution was adopted by yeas 25, nays 14. 

          
          

          

          
            THE EXTRA ALLOWANCE, AGAIN.

             Mr. WOLCOTT moved to reconsider the vote adopting the resolution allowing $3 for
              every 25 miles traveled by members of the Prison Committee in
              visiting the State Prisons. He regarded it as wrong, and while he would not oppose
              paying the actual expenses of the visit, he did oppose this extravagant allowance to
              members, not say anything about their railroad passes. He did not desire to be
              captious, but hoped the vote of a few minutes since, passing the resolution would be
              reconsidered and the resolution rejected.

            A motion to lay the motion to reconsider On the table was rejected by yeas 10 nays
              27.

            The motion to reconsider was agreed to.

            The resolution was then referred to the Committee on Fees and
                Salaries. 

          
          

          
            THE SOUTHERN PRISON.

            Mr. KINLEY asked and obtained unanimous consent to submit the following:

            
              
                
                  
                  
                     Mr. PRESIDENT-
                  

                  The sub-committee on States Prisons, appointed to investigate and report to the
                    Senate the condition and management of the State Prison South, respectfully ask
                    leave to make the following supplementary statement explanatory of their former
                    report: "The facts in the possession of the Committee do not implicate the
                    Prison Physician, Clerk, Deputy Warden, or the Matron, and these officers should
                    have been included among the honorable exceptions. The Committee wish to be
                    distinctly understood as intending to implicate only the parties charged with
                    corrupt charges in their report.

                  
                    ISAAC KINLEY, "Chairman Sub-Com, on States
                        Prisons."
                  
                
              
            

          
          

          
            THE GENERAL APPROPRIATION BILL.

            On motion by Mr. WOLCOTT, the general appropriation bill [H. R. 309] was taken up, and the refusal of the
              House of Representatives to concur in the Senate amendment striking out the
              appropriation of $1,500 for the military claim agency being read-

            Mr. ARMSTRONG moved that the Senate recede from its amendment.

            The motion was agreed to by yeas 20, nays 16. 

            The refusal of the House of Representatives to concur in the Senate amendment
              increasing the appropriation for the House of Refuge from $20,000 to $30,000 being
              read-

            Mr. FISHER thought it ridiculous to appropriate fifty thousand dollars for additional
              buildings and then not make provision to occupy them when completed. Unless this
              appropriation is made for the support of the inmates the fifty thousand dollars
              appropriated for buildings should' not be made. As he understood it, that fifty
              thousand dollar appropriation has been agreed to by both houses.

            Mr. BRADLEY. Inasmuch as we have $50,000 to put up these buildings, the Senate ought
              to insist on the amendment, or the buildings will lie idle until a future Legislature
              convenes.

            Mr. SCOTT did not believe the new building would be finished before the next session
              of the Legislature, one year from next January, and that being the case there is no
              need of making this additional appropriation this session.

            Mr. CRAVENS was inclined to think such institutions were profitable, as a general
              rule, and that being so, it is more than probable that the $20,000 appropriated for
              1870 will be more than ample.

            Mr. FOSDICK thought there was not: much probability that the buildings could: be
              completed before the next session, and for this reason should vote in favor of
              receding from the Senate amendment.

            Mr. HOOPER believed this appropriation to be necessary. This institution is in its
              infancy, and much of the labor of these boys will be applied to carying on the
              improvements, as most of their labor heretofore has been in that direction. The
              building will be ready for occupancy unquestionably before the next regular session;
              and we ought to make a provision by which the building may be used as soon as
              completed.

            Mr. KINLEY was satisfied that this institution has not asked for an unreasonable
              amount. We should reflect that crime inconstantly on the increase, and that the object
              of this institution is to take boys who have learned crime in the streets and take,
              care of them and make useful citizens of them.

            Mr. HANNA having moved to recede from the Senate amendment-

            Mr. ROBINSON, of Decatur, demanded the previous question.

            The Senate seconded the demand, and" under the operations of the previous
              question-

            The motion to recede was agreed to by yeas 26, nays 11. 

          
          

          
            NEW PROPOSITIONS.

            The following bills were introduced, reader the first time, and passed to the second,
              reading:

            HOUSE BILLS PASSED TO THE FINAL READING.

             On motion of Mr. BELLAMY the following bills were read by title only and passed:

              was referred to the Committee on Education. 

          
          

          
            EXTRA ALLOWANCEAGAIN.

            Mr. RICE offered a resolution that the officers of the Senate be allowed six dollars
              worth of postage stamps, and that the Chairmen of Committees be allowed three dollars
              worth of stationery.

            Mr. CASE moved to amend by striking out all that refers to the stationery for
              Committees.

            Mr. BELLAMY moved to postpone the further consideration of the resolution and
              amendment till next Wednesday, at two o'clock, P. M.

            The yeas and nays being demanded, ordered and taken, resulted, yeas 10, nays 24.

            So the motion to postpone was rejected.

            The amendment was rejected.

            The resolution was then adopted.

            And then the Senate adjourned till 'Tuesday morning at ten o'clock. 

          
          

        
        

        
          HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.

          Mr. PALMER moved ineffectually to take up the consideration of his bill [H. R. 104] to
            amend the 397th section of the Practice act-relative to taxation of costs.

          On the motion of Mr. STEWART, of Rush, the House took up the consideration of bills on
            the third reading. 

          
            THE MEDICAL PROFESSION.

            Mr. Overmyer's bill [H. R. 24] entitled a bill to regulate the standing of the
              Medical Profession, declaring who may practice Medicine in its various departments,
              and providing penalties for its violation, was taken up.

            It proposes to make it unlawful for any person to practice medicine in this
              "State who has not attended two full courses of instruction and graduated at some
              school of medicine, and is not a person of good moral character" except where
              such "person has been continually in the practice of medicine for a period of ten
              years or more," &c. Penalty for first violation: A fine not leas than $50 nor
              more; than $100,and for a second violation imprisonment in the county jail for thirty
              days in addition to the fine.

            Practitioners shall be licensed by a Board of Censors "appointed by a duly
              incorporated State Medical Society or as ciation, and the full name of such person
              shall be registered in the office of the Re corder of the county in which such person
              resides or proposes to practice," &c.

            On the 12th of February last, a select committee composed of Messrs. Jump
              Breckinridge, Hutchings, Baker and Furnas, to whom was referred this bill and that
              introduced by Mr. Vater, reported a substitute amendment embracing the provisions
              above described.

            Mr. VATER said, in this bill there was an effort to embody the best features of both
              bills.

            The final vote on the last reading resulted-yeas 53, nays 15-as follows:

            
              
                
                  YEAS-Messrs. Admire, Barnett, Barritt Bates, Beatty,

            So the bill passed the House of Representatives.

            On motion of Mr. WILDMAN, the vote for the order for the consideration of bills on
              the third reading was reconsidered and an order was adopted for the consideration of
              bills of the House on the second reading. 

          
          

          
            BLACKFORD'S REPORTS.

            Mr. Osborn's s bill [H. R. 61] to encourage the republication of
              Blackford's Reports, (with the amendments thereto,) was taken up.

            On motion of Mr. Coffroth, (stating that the House has heretofore evinced
              indifference and opposition to this proposition,) was indefinitely postponed. 

          
          

          
            UNLAWFUL COMBINATIONS.

            Mr. Osborn's bill [H. R. 209] to define certain offences, to prescribe
              punishment therefor; to suppress the usurpations of the functions of the Judiciary in
              the punishment of real or pretended offences, (making such unlawful combinations
              punishable as felonies as well as combinations a conspiracies to take prisoners out of
              custody of officers of the law, punishable with imprisonment in the State Prison no
              less than one nor more than fourteen  years,) was
              taken up, read and ordered to be engrossed. 

          
          

          
            RIGHT OF ACTION.

             Mr. Johnston of Parke's bill [H. R. 234] declaratory of the meaning of sections
              14 and 16 of the act regarding landlords, tenants, lessors and lessees, approved March
              4, 1852, and to authorize and give a right of action by one joint tenant, tenant in
              common or tenant in coparcenary, and to recover rents for use and occupancy of land
              from such tenant in possession, was taken up and ordered to the engrossment. 

          
          

          
            RECORD EVIDENCE, ETC.

            Mr. Willson's bill [H. R. 80] declaring that the record of judgment and sheriffs
              deed shall be sufficient evidence prima facie to establish title to
              real estate sold 'under a sheriff sale on execution, and providing that such sale
              shall not be adjudged void or set aside on account of the failure of the sheriff to
              sell in parcels, was taken up with the amendment reported from the Judiciary
                Committee, striking out the second section, with reference to the failure
              to sell in parcels.

            The amendment was concurred in and so the bill was ordered to be engrossed. 

          
          

          
            MUNICIPAL BANK TAXATION.

            Mr. Vater's bill [H. R. 219] to amend section 9 of the act to provide for the
              assessment and collection of taxes on the shares of stock owned in banks and banking
              associations doing business in this State, approved March 6, 1807, [proposing to
              insert these words: "this act shall be so construed as to authorize and apply to
              the taxation of all private, State or National Banks or Banking Associations, for
              municipal purposes,"] was taken up and ordered to be engrossed. 

          
          

          
            REAL ESTATE TAXES IN CITIES AND TOWNS.

            Mr. Wile's bill [H. R. 153] to repeal all laws providing that not more than five
              acres shall be subject to taxation within a city, and to make all property subject to
              State and county taxation within a city subject to taxation for city purposes, was
              taken up with the amendments reported from the Committee on Cities and
                Towns-to include towns as well as cities in its provisions.

            Mr. COFFROTH said he really did not Know how far, or whether this bill is altogether
              right. There was authority in the general law by which the authorities of cities and
              towns can extend their jurisdiction almost as they please; but they should hardly take
              in farms and tax them as city Property. And might it not be, if this bill Passes, that
              they can extend their limits all over the county if they please, and tax them? How far
              that is right, gentlemen living in cities could tell perhaps better than he, whose
              residence was in but a respectable town.

            Mr. WELBORN. The people of his city and of the neighboring town of Mount Vernon
              wanted this bill to pass for the reason that a few rich men with lands in the heart of
              town are exempt from taxation. As to the supposed objection, he considered that the
              power given to the little towns to extend their limits was well enough guarded to
              prevent difficulty in that respect. The Common Council could not do any great injury
              as he understood the law, although he had not observed the working of the law in this
              regard, living, as he does, in a city controlled by a special charter. But he knew
              perhaps half a dozen cases in Mount Vernon which made it desirable there that this
              bill should pass. He had known something of the workings of the general law in that
              place. And he did not think the powers granted in this bill could work any harm. For
              if they take in my farm they have got to improve; and it was only a question with
              sensible men whether they will gain anything by the taxation above the costs of
              improvements. He did not think we need be afraid of the passage of this bill, for he
              knew many cases where men are reaping large benefits by holding tracts of valuable
              land exempt from taxation.

            Mr. STEWART, of Rush, said he would like to move to strike from the bill all that
              relates to towns-the amendment recommended by the committee.

            Mr. OSBORN had very serious objections to the bill, and thought he could show where
              it would work great hardships. While it seemed to be intended only to raise taxes,
              there was another way in which it would operate. Under the general law-section
              35-cities and towns have jurisdiction for two miles around, for the purpose of
              exercising a kind of police regulation. And it had been held in one case in his
              county, that that law could not be enforced; that no city has a just right to extend
              its jurisdiction beyond its limits; for, if it could, such a city as New Albany could
              extend its jurisdiction into the city of Louisville and the city of Jeffersonville.
              Therefore these city jurisdictions, instead of being extended, ought to be confined to
              their specific limits. It was proposed by the general law, simply to extend
              jurisdiction over unoccupied territory, to abate annoyances. So far the jurisdiction
              and control might be well enough. But this bill enables them to tax; and as the
              gentleman from Huntington (Mr. Coffroth) had suggested, it would be giving them power,
              and getting them into the way of taxing farms and farm lands not at all connected with
              the cities. He considered this a serious objection to the bill. And there was the city
              of Terre Haute, which had attached a whole section-the 16th section.  He thought that not only towns ought to be stricken out of
              its provisions, but that the whole bill ought to be indefinitely postponed.

            Mr. JOHNSTON, of Parke, read from the statute, showing that exemption from taxation
              does not apply to any tract of land within the city limits exceeding twenty acres.
              While he considered the bill might not be right in all respects, it might be amended
              so as to make it acceptable. He referred to the injustice of the law which exempts the
              larger tracts from taxation altogether. If a man holds twenty-one acres he is exempt.
              But if he holds only nineteen, or even twenty, he is taxed for town purposes. There
              was no equity in this. But if a man has over twenty acres he should be taxed for
              twenty acres if not for the excess. He denied that towns can extend their limits at
              pleasure. It takes a previous application to the County Board upon petition, and the
              case has to he tried; and they have to show good reason for the extension. In view of
              the fact that the law as it now stands is deficient as to the provisions for taxing
              real estate in incorporated towns, and believing as he did that the bill is
              deficient-that it will not apply the needed remedy-he would prefer that it be referred
              to a special committee of five members. He then read the law which applies to the
              extension of town limits-the Trustees to present petition to the County Board,
              accompanying the same with a map, etc., verified by affidavit; to give thirty
              days' notice; to serve a copy on the owners of such territory, and then the case
              may be tried by the County Board. He insisted that by referring the subject to a
              committee of five, a bill might be framed that would be acceptable to the people.

            Mr. VATER. This bill gave no new power in regard to extending these city limits. A
              man who has over five acres within the limits should be just as liable to taxation as
              other land holders. A man who has five acres and a fine house-land set with shrubbery,
              used for agricultural or horticultural purposes-he could not see why a man who has
              five acres, or upwards, should be exempt from taxation, while a man who owns forty
              feet is not. He knew at least one case where a man owns such a tract, and raises
              shrubbery and flowers, worth thousands of dollars, and he is not taxed. He spoke of
              these cases in cities, and he thought this abuse was equally applicable to the
              towns.

            Mr. ZOLLARS said there were men in his section controlling millions of property who
              are thus exempt from taxes. The consequence was that poor men pay their taxes. He
              would favor the bill along with the power to extend the city limits. For whenever you
              build a new street or sewer whenever you make any public improvement-it was for the
              advantage of the adjoining farm. He had not examined the bill very particularly; but
              if there was any only thing the cities need more than another it is this very law.

            Mr. WILLSON. The only objection to the bill was, that cities and towns may extend
              their limits and take in adjoining farms; but the objection was not a good I one,
              because of one fact: Because this extension must be made upon the order of the I
              County Commissioners. And from such decision parties have the right of appeal to : the
              courts. They would not extend their jurisdiction without good cause. The proposed
              commitment of the bill would be equivalent to its defeat, and if the gentleman from
              Parke could point out its defects; he thought that the proper amendments ! could be
              applied at once by the House. 

            Mr. JOHNSTON, of Parke, disclaimed any desire to delay the bill. He merely wanted to
              amend it so that we can tax up to the twenty acres, and exempt the excess.

            Mr. WILLSON. The bill provides that all property in the cities taxed for State and
              county purposes, shall be taxed for municipal purposes.

            Mr. JOHNSTON. That was the very thing I he wanted to revise.

            The motion (Mr. Johnson's) prevailed, and the bill was referred to a select
              committee of five. 

          
          

          
            THE GENERAL APPROPRIATION BILL.

            Mr. COTTON rose to a question of privilege. He desired to have the General
              Appropriation bill recalled from the Senate for a correction in the enrollment. He had
              learned that the House amendment making the appropriation of $2,000 for the boiler and
              engine room for the Northern Prison had been enrolled as an appropriation for a boiler
              room and engine house for the House of Refuge.

            The SPEAKER. The Chair understands that the House amendments to that bill have been
              concurred in, and the bill returned, the Senate receding and concurring in the
              amendments.

            Mr. OSBORN. This was merely a clerical error, which the House has the right to
              correct. He was just informed by a Senator, that the item of appropriation occur? in
              connection with the House of Refuge instead of the Northern Prison.

            The SPEAKER. The Chair was informed here, that the bill does not show any such
              error.

            Mr. DITTEMORE. The error is, that the bill as returned from the Senate, does not show
              that we struck out $5000 and inserted $2000. ["Consent, Consent."]

            On motion of Mr. SABIN, the matter was  referred
              to a special committee, Messrs. Sabin, Vater, and Osborn. 

          
          

          
            JUSTICES' JURISDICTION.

            On motion of Mr. WILSON, Mr. Williams of Knox's bill [H. R.31] to amend section
              9 of the act of 1852 providing for the election and qualification of Justices of the
              Peace, was taken up, with the Judiciary Committee's amendment thereto, limiting
              the jurisdiction to the Township, (instead of the County, as in the original bill,)
              and providing, that, "in all cases where the debt sued on does not exceed
              twenty-five dollars, it shall be lawful to bring an action in the Township where the
              debt was contracted, irrespective of the residence of the defendant in said county,
              provided the same is in the county of the defendant's residence."

            Mr. PIERCE, of Porter. As far as he understood from the reading, this would extend
              the Justices' jurisdiction in criminal cases.

            The SPEAKER caused the section to be Again read, and the text gives express
              limitation "in civil cases."

            Mr. ODELL moved to strike out "twenty-five" and insert
              ""fifty" in lieu.

            Mr. WILLIAMS, of Knox, moved to indefinitely postpone the whole thing.

            Mr. DUNN. One of the objections to the original bill was, that it gave a party the
              right to sue out of the county, and the committee put in a limitation to the county.
              Another objection was that the amount was too large, and it was thought proper, in
              this proposed extension, to give the Justice of the Peace jurisdiction over no more
              than $25. What did this bill propose to do? It proposed that any merchant who may
              reside in a town or a city, if John Doe tomes down to him from one of the outer
              townships and purchases three dollars worth of goods on credit, that, instead of
              employing an attorney to go to John Doe in his own township and collect that three
              dollars, the merchant may have his action against John Doe where the debt was
              contracted. But so long as we have no such law as this, the consequence is that
              accounts of this kind are not collected are standing out all over the State. It had
              been said that the bill will work hardships on the farmers and the masses. He
              contended that it is no hardship to require a man to fulfill his contracts. The bill
              was simply to allow the creditor in town to enforce his rights against the debtor
              living in the country. There was a legal maxim: "It is to the interest of the
              Republic that there be an end of litigation," and you are carrying out this maxim
              when you Pass this bill; for, instead of riding fifteen fifteen miles to litigate a
              case where only two or three dollars is involved, you give the account to a constable
              and there is an end of it.

            Mr. ZOLLARS-What was the limit in in the bill!

            Mr. DUNN. Twenty-five dollars. That was to give strength to the bill. But he
              contended that the bill is right in principle. If the farmer sees proper to go fifteen
              miles and buy a few pounds of coffee on credit, I insist that, if he will not come in
              and pay that debt, the merchant should have the right to call him to answer his
              complaint where the debt was contrated.

            Mr. GORDON said he should vote for the indefinite postponement of the bill for two or
              three reasons. In the first place (said he), I hold that it is proper for a
              Legislative Assembly to legislate so that the credit system will be abolished as far
              as possible; but the result of this bill will be to facilitate the credit system. The
              merchant or trader, knowing that he could sue in his own township, would give more
              credits. Another reason why he should oppose the bill was, that in all our townships
              we have Justices of the Peace; and it is very difficult to get men that are competent
              to act as Justices of the Peace in the outer townships; and the operation of this bill
              will be to take away most of the business from these Justices in the outer townships.
              He was opposed to the bill for yet another reason. It will increase the amount of
              costs in these petty cases. The constable will have to go to the residence of the
              debtor, and tax his mileage against him. Whereas now the constables m the towns get
              little or no mileage.

            Mr. DAVIDSON was in favor of the bill as it now stands. He could see nothing in it
              that is going to work unfairly. If the poor man can come from the outer townships and
              ask the dealer to credit him;-it was very clear that the merchant wants custom, and is
              not apt to process a man without cause, or until his patience is worn out. Then the
              bill says that when he is forced to sue on these small accounts he shall not be
              compelled to go to the township of the debtor to collect a few dollars-he shall not be
              compelled to spend more time than his debt is worth in the collection. It was
              certainly doing but simple justice to give the creditor this advantage. He would not
              have the limitation extended beyond $25, because if the amount were over $25 the
              creditor could afford to go out and collect his debt under the law as it now
              stands.

            Mr. CUNNINGHAM would oppose the bill because it would encourage litigation and would
              take away the business of the Justices of the Peace in the outer townships.

            Mr. JOHNSTON, of Parke. I can see no impropriety in allowing a man to sue in  a township where the debt is contracted up to the
              amount where he can get jurisdiction in the Common Pleas. Up to that amount the
              Justice may safely have jurisdiction. If the merchant now has an account amounting to
              $51 he sues in the Common Pleas Court, and taxes his debtor in double the amount of
              costs that might have accrued before a Justice of the Peace. If such a debt is
              contracted in a town for goods, I say it is right that the Justice of the Peace shall
              have jurisdiction to collect in the township where it is contracted. There is no
              justice in compelling the merchant or mechanic to go into the outer townships to
              collect these small debts.

            On the motion of Mr. COFFROTH, the further consideration of the bill was postponed,
              and it was made the special order for Tuesday at 2 o'clock.

            Mr. COFFROTH, obtaining leave for the purpose, reported back the Savings Bank bill,
              with the recommendation of the special committee thereon.

            Mr. OSBORN, obtaining leave, returned the bill [S.
                239] to authorize the classification of Boards of Directors of Railroad
              Companies, with the recommendation that it pass by the Special Railroad
                Committee.

            Mr. WILDMAN called up his bill [H. R. 79] to provide for the erection and repair of
              bridges, with the favorable report thereon, reported from the Committee on
                Roads.The bill proposes to place bridge matters in the hands of the
              Township Trustees, with a provision that their erection may be compelled by the
              Township Trustees, and that no one bridge shall cost more than $1,500.

            Mr. WILDMAN moved that the report of the Committee on Roads be
              concurred in. As the law now stands the County Commissioners have direetionary power;
              but you can not compel them to build a bridge. By this bill, you can compel them. And
              the amendment of the bill gives a discretion to the Township Trustees to contribute to
              the erection of bridges out of the Township Fund.

            Mr. McFADIN thought this would be giving too much power to the township trustees.
              This bridge question always regulates itself. And he feared that under this amendment
              there might be undue influences brought to bear upon the township trustees to build
              bridges unnecessarily, where they are not wanted.

            Mr. WILDMAN. It gives the township trustees power to make apropriations out of any
              money, except the School fund. But they can t appropriate more than $1,500 to make a
              bridge.

            The Committee's amendment was agreed to-affirmative 33, negative 20-no quorum
              voting.

            Mr. CORY and others making t point against doing business without & quorum, and
              other members desirous of an adjournment-

            Mr. COFFROTH desired to make an explanation with regard to the failure to enroll the
              House amendment to the General Appropriation bill reducing the appropriation to the
              North Prison improvement from $5,000 to $2,000. He said the amendment was not sent up
              in writing, and therefore it was no fault of the Clerk that there is no record of the
              amendment. The Clerk found nothing among the papers to direct his attention to the
              amendment. He said this as an act of justice to the Clerk-that he may not be placed in
              a false light in this matter.

            On motion of Mr. WILSON the House adjourned till Tuesday morning at 9 o'clock.

             TUESDAY, 
                April 26, 1869.
                April 27, 1869.
              
          

          The Senate met at 10 o'clock A. M., pursuant to adjournment-the
            Lieutenant Governor in the chair.

          On motion by Mr. ROBINSON, of Madison, the reading of the Secretary's minutes of
            Saturday was dispensed with.

          On motion by Mr. KINLEY, the report of the Prison Committee the
            order for this hour-was made the special order for tomorrow at 10 o'clock. 

          
            THE DIVORCE LAW.

            On motion by Mr. CASE, his bill [S. 316] relative to the residence of parties
              plaintiff, and regulating summons of defendants to divorce cases, &c., was pressed
              to the final reading, under a dispensation of the Constitutional restriction, and
              passed the Senate by yeas 32, nays 0.

            On his further motion, his bill [S. 317] to provide against fraud and corruption in
              procuring divorces in this State, &c., was read the third time.

            Mr. CHURCH thought this bill would only thicken the difficulties of our divorce laws,
              and consequently withheld his support.

            Mr. HOOPER also opposed its passage.

            The bill passed the Senate by yeas 31, nays 7. 

          
          

          
            GERMAN IN THE COMMON SCHOOLS.

            On motion by Mr. BELLAMY, the bill [H. R. 62]
              to amend section 147 of the Common School Law of March 6, 1865, authorizing the German
              language to be taught in the common schools, when the parents or guardians of
              twenty-five pupils shall require it, was taken up.

            On motion by Mr. CAVIN, the constitutional restriction was dispensed with, in order
              that the bill may be pressed to its final reading.

            

            Mr. FISHER moved to strike out the words "twenty-five," and insert a
              provision lieu that it shall require a majority to demand that the German language
              shall be taught in the public schools. He thought the bill was wrong in this
              particular. The majority should always govern.

            Mr. BELLAMY resisted the amendment, and stated reasons why he thought it should be
              rejected.

            Mr. HADLEY believed the amendment would defeat the whole object of the bill, and
              spoke in favor of the passage of the bill without the amendment.

            Mr. FISHER regarded it as wrong to allow five or six parents to control several
              hundred in this matter. He was willing to vote for a provision allowing German schools
              to be established, but unwilling to allow this demand by so small a minority; and
              that, too, when it may effect the usefulness of an entire school by compelling the
              Trustee to hire a German teacher who is not as well qualified as he should be in other
              branches required to be taught.

            Mr. MORGAN considered the German language a great acquisition, and was decidedly in
              favor of the bill. He thought a German teacher might be called in from time to time to
              teach this class.

            Mr. CAVIN would regret to see this amendment adopted. The German population compose
              almost one-third of our population, and such a measure as this is due them. He urged
              the passage of the bill, referring repeatedly to the fact that numerous petitions had
              been presented here, from time to time, in favor of such a measure.

            Mr. CARSON, while in favor of the pending amendment, proposed to still further amend
              by adding a provision including the French language.

            Mr. CRAVENS fully sympathised with the object proposed by the bill, but objected to
              the mode prescribed. It proposes to change somewhat the character of our common school
              education, the greatest object of which is a national system of education. He would be
              willing to see the German and even the French language incorporated as a branch of
              study in the higher schools the State University for instance. He favored the general
              principle running through the whole frame work of our Government - that a majority
              should rule-and consequently hoped the amendment would be adopted.

            Mr. CHURCH favored the bill because an acquisition of the German language was more
              important to our children than any other, excepting the English language only. He did
              not regard the bill as allowing any of a majority by five or six guardians or parents;
              because the others need not avail themselves of the German branch unless desirable. He
              regarded this as an important measure, and hoped the amendment would be voted
              down.

            Mr. CARSON, as he understood it, did not think the amendment was the thing wanted by
              the German population of the State. They preferred to manage the German department
              themselves, as he had been informed.

            Mr. CAVIN did not think they wanted either a separation of the fund, or a separation
              from the children in our common schools. He spoke again in favor of the passage of the
              bill, and against the amendment, arguing that you must adapt legislation to the
              character of your population.

            Mr. TURNER opposed the amendment, and favored the passage of the bill, because of the
              benefits that would inure to the whole public. He regarded the knowledge of the German
              language as an accomplishment; and for these reasons alone was desirous to see the
              measure passed.

            Mr. BEARDSLEY demanded the previous question.

            The demand was seconded by the Senate, and under its operation-

            The amendment was rejected.

            Mr. CARSON made several ineffectual motions to get his amendment, including the
              French language, before the Senate.

            The bill was then read the third time, and finally passed by yeas 37, nays 3.

            Mr. CARSON explaining that he voted for it as the best thing he was able to do under
              the circumstances.

            Mr. CRAVENS voted "no," and in explanation said he did so in the hope that
              he might yet be able to offer a proposition, embodying his views-distinctly stating,
              however, that he was favorable to the main object of the bill.

            Mr. JOHNSON of Montgomery, voted "no," because this bill would nesessarily
              interfere with school matters all through the several counties in a way that would
              prove embarrassing and detrimental to the present system. 

          
          

          
            GENERAL APPROPRIATION BILL.

            On motion of Mr. WOLCOTT, the House amendment to the General Appropriation Bill,
              reducing the appropriation of the Senate for an engine room at the Northern
              State's Prison from $5,000 to $2,000,' was taken up. He moved that the
              Senate adhere to its amendment.

            Mr. FISHER and Mr. CHURCH were satisfied that $5,000 was not too much.

            Mr. SMITH was of the opinion that $2,000 was not sufficient and $5,000 was too much.
              $4,000 is ample.

            On motion of Mr. HANNA' the Senate concurred in the House amendment.

            And then the Senate took a recess till 2 P. M.
            

          
          

          

          
            AFTERNOON SESSION.

            A call of the Senate was ordered and continued till 42 members appeared and answered
              to their names, when-

            On motion of Mr. CHURCH, further proceedings under the call were dispensed with. 


          
            THE BAKER-CUMBACK CORRESPONDENCE.

            Mr. RICE called up the special order, viz.: his resolution of Friday last to expunge
              from the Senate journal the resolutions relating to the Baker-Cumback
              correspondence-and demanded the previous question thereon.

            The demand for the previous question was demanded by the Senate-20 to 7-and under its
              operation the resolution was passed by yeas 35, nays 8-as follows:

            
              
                
                  YEAS-Messrs. Andrews, Bellamy, Carson, Case, Caven, Church,

                    Hooper, Kinley, and Reynolds-8.
                
              
            

            Pending the roll call-

            Messrs. Cravens, Fisher, Hamilton, Hanna, Hooper, Humphreys, Johnson of Montgomery,
              Kinley, Lee, Morgan, Rice, Robinson of Madison, Sherrod, Smith and Turner, each made
              remarks in explanation of their votes, as their names were called.

            The PRESIDENT pro tem. [Mr. Gray in the Chair] announced the
              special order-being the bill [S. 282] defining and prescribing punishment for libel;
              which was read the third time.

            On motion by Mr. ROBINSON, of Decatur, it was laid on the table. 

          
          

          
            BOUNTY FUNDS.

            The bill [H. R. 40] to enable County
              Commissioners to demand or sue for any unexpended bounty fund not accounted for, was
              read the second time.

            On motion by Mr. MORGAN, the Constitutional restriction was dispensed with, the bill
              was read the third time, and finally passed the Senate by yeas 36, nays 2. 

          
          

          
            INTEREST ON JUDGMENTS.

            The bill [H. R. 14] to amend section 3 of the act regulating interest on money was
              read the second time and passed to the third reading. 

          
          

          
            NEGROES IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS.

            The bill [H. R. 113] to render taxation for
              common school purposes uniform and to provide for the education of colored children,
              was read the second time with a committee amendment that colored children shall be
              admitted in the same room with white children, where no objection is made.

            Mr. CARSON moved to amend the committee amendment by providing that the colored
              children shall be excluded whenever any objection is made.

            Mr. CRAVENS did not like the amend-merit. It seems to be an outrage to tax the
              parents of black children, and yet allow them to be excluded by the objection of
              probably not more than two or three. He moved to lay the amendment on the table.

            The motion was agreed to yeas 20, nays 18-as follows:

            
              
                
                  YEAS - Messrs. Andrews, Beardsley, Bellamy, Case, Church,
                    Cravens, Eliott, Fisher, Fosdick, Gray, Hamilton, Hess, Hooper, Johnson of
                    Spencer, Kinley, Reynolds, Robinson of Madison Robinson of Decatur, Scott and
                    Wood-20.

                  NAYS-Messrs. Carson, Denbo, Gifford, Hanna, Henderson, Howk,
                    Huey, Huffman, Humphreys, Jaquess, Johnson of Montgomery, Laselle, Lee, Morgan,
                    Rice, Sherrod, Smith and Taggart-18.
                
              
            

            Mr. SCOTT desired to see the bill perfected so that the schools for blacks shall be
              entirely separate from the schools of white children. He desired to avoid all trouble
              and neighborhood excitements on this question. Where you join the two schools together
              they will not harmonize in the section of country represented by him. The way is open,
              plain and direct to provide for separate schools. The change proposed in the amendment
              to the bill is a slight one; but when it comes to a neighborhood where there are but
              three or four colored children the question will come up and be decided whether the
              blacks shall attend the schools with the whites or not. Whereas, if there were colored
              schools organized separately, the blacks would not try to get in the white schools,
              and you would never hear of any trouble on that score. He would like to see the
              amendment laid on the table.

            Mr. BELLAMY thought the amendment fair and reasonable. According to the bill whenever
              any one objects, even after the black children are admitted to the public school, the
              Trustee must exclude them.

            Mr. SCOTT could not see where the power would come from to exclude black children
              after they get in the white school.

            Mr. CRAVENS asked where the law can be found that will exclude the child of any
              citizen in the State from the public schools, without regard to race or color.

            Mr. GRAY and Mr. BELLAMY thought that even after the blacks were in the school and
              objection should be made, the amendment would cause them to be excluded by the
              Trustee, on demand of any one.

            Mr. MORGAN was willing to vote to tax his constituents so that colored children shall
              have the privilege of the school fund, but could not vote for any bill looking to the
              mixing of the races. He would do as much for the colored people, according his means
              and influence, as any one; would vote for no bill that would encourage hard feelings
              or disturbances of any kind. The races should be kept distinct. We are  disposed to give them all the rights the constitution and
              laws guarantee them, but not willing to take them into our houses or into our
              schools.

            Mr. HAMILTON saw no injustice in the amendment, and hoped it would prevail.

            Mr. KINLEY. It is unconstitutional and unjust to exclude the child of any citizen of
              the State from the public schools. He should vote for the amendment in order to get
              the bill a little more humane; but should vote against the bill on Constitutional
              grounds.

            Mr. CARSON moved to lay the amendment on the table.

            The motion was agree to by yeas 20, nays 18 - as follows - 

            
              
                

                  YEAS-Messrs. Carson, Gifford, Gray, Hanna, Henderson, Howk,

            Mr. GRAY, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, objected to the
              amendment, because it allowed any person in a school to object to a child's
              attendance because of its dark skin.

            Mr. HANNA moved to amend by providing that of the moneys collected by taxation for
              school purposes in any township, no greater sum shall be expended in support of
              colored schools than shall have arisen from the assessment of the property of colored
              people.

            Mr. ROBINSON, of Madison, moved to lay the amendment on the table.

            The motion was agreed to by yeas 25, nays 14.The bill was then passed to the third
              reading.

            The bill [H. R. 50] to amend the city and town
              incorporation act, coming up-

            Mr. ELLIOTT desired to pass it now, so that cities and towns which have elections
              coming off soon may avail themselves of we benefit of this bill.

            It being read the second time-

            On motion by Mr. ELLIOTT the constitutional rule was dispensed with, the bill read
              the third time and finally passed by yeas 33, nays 5.

            The bill [H. R. 132] to enable cities to aid
              the construction of railroads and water powers, was read the second time.

            Mr. ROBINSON, of Madison, moved to amend by inserting the words "Hydraulic
              Companies" in the proper place.

            The amendment was agreed to.

            |The bill [H. R. 322]for the perfecting of railroad lines-was read by title and
              referred to a committee. 

            And then the Senate adjourned. 

          
          
          
          
        
        

        
          
          HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

          The House met at 9 o'clock A. M.
          

          
            PETITIONS.

            Mr. CORY presented a petition for the amendment of the Gravel Road laws.

            Mr. DUNN presented a claim. 

          
          

          
            REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.

            Mr. PIERCE, of Vigo, from the Committee on the Judiciary, returned
              Mr. Williams, of Hamilton's bill (H. R. 222,) to authorize persons accused of
              crimes or misdemeanor to testify, recommending that it be indefinitely postponed.

            Mr. DUNN, from the same Committee, returned the bill, (S. 95,) to amend section 303
              of the Practice act, recommending its indefinite postponement.

            Mr. COFFROTH, from the same Committee, returned Mr. McDonald s bill (H, R. 267,) to
              authorize the Auditor of State, to adopt an uniform system of book keeping; with a
              recommendation that it be indefinitely postponed. He also returned the bill to
              authorize the State to take a change of venue, etc., with the same recommendation.

            He also returned the bill of the House No.--, defining who are competent witnesses in
              the courts, with the same recommendation.

            These reports were severally concurred in.

            Mr. SKIDMORE, from the Committee on Fees and Salaries, returned
              Mr. Bowen's bill, to so amend the law as to pay mileage (five cents a mile) to
              witnesses compelled to attend before grand juries, recommending that it be
              indefinitely postponed.

            Mr. BOWEN said this is a bill to provide an allowance of five cents a mile (going and
              coming) to persons compelled to attend before grand juries. He thought it unjust that
              this service should be required without compensation. He was opposed to the report of
              the committee, and hoped the House would entertain the bill, for you can not have
              courts without witnesses.

            After further debate by Mr. Monroe, in favor of the report; by Mr. Davidson, and
              others-

            Mr. UNDERWOOD demanded the yeas and nays, which were taken and resulted-yeas 42, nays
              31-as follows:

            So the report was concurred in, and the bill was postponed accordingly.

            OMISSION IN THE GENERAL BILL.

            Mr. VATER, from the special committee on the mistake in the general appropriation
              bill [H. R. 309.] submitted a report, finding
              that the House amendment to the Senate amendment of the bill, appropriating $5,000 for
              boiler and engine room for the Northern Prison was not sent up in writing to the
              Clerk, and for that reason it was not engrossed.

            Subsequently Mr. COFFROTH submitted the following order, which was adopted:

            
              
                
                  Resolved, That the Clerk is hereby directed to return to-the Senate, House bill
                    No. 306, entitled an act making general appropriations, together with the House
                    engrossed amendment to the Senate amendment, making an appropriation of five
                    thousand dollars for building and engine and boiler house at the Northern State
                    Prison ; and that he inform the Senate of the omission to transmit said
                    amendment of the House, and ask the Senate to concur in the same. 
                
              
            

          
          

          
            CLAIMS.

            Mr. SABIN, from the Committee on Claims, returned the claims of
              Dr. J. R. Tillman, Julius Boetticher,of the Volksblatt, and R. M.
              Smith, recommending that they be allowed and incoporated in the specific appropriation
              bill, which reports were concurred in.

            He also returned the claims of James Buchanan for $185 50 for discount on exchange,
              and the claims af Julius Petty, for damages to his farm by the military, in 1862, 1863
              and 1865, recommending that they be not allowed.

            The reports were concurred in.

            He also returned the claim of James R. Peelle, for $100 for attorneys' fees paid
              on the Beatty-Peelle contest; and the claim of Samuel Beatty for $161 expenses
              incurred by him in said contest, recommending that the same be allowed, &c.

            After debate-these reports were laid on the table.

            The SPEAKER laid before the House two communications from the Governor-the first
              transmitting a supplementary report of the Directors of the Northern Prison, embracing
              the report of Alf. Wood, Moral Instructor there-asking for an appropriation to
              replenish the library, &c.

            They were laid on the table. 

          
          

          
            TAX LEINS ON REAL ESTATE.

            Mr. Shoemaker's bill [H. R. 136] creating a lein on real estate sold for taxes,
              &c., was taken up and read the third time.

            Mr. WELBORN explained that the only change in the law proposed by this bill was that
              when the sale of land for taxes is made and it is irregular, if you buy the land you
              still hold the lein on the land, unless the party has paid the taxes previous to the
              sale. No irregularity shall deprive the purchaser of his money and the 50 per cent
              under the existing law.

            Mr. WILDMAN said, as the law now stands, it is almost impossible to make a tax title
              stand.

            The bill failed - yeas 44, nays 24 - for want of a Constitutional majority.

            Mr. Kercheval's bill [H. R. 67] regulating certain feess and allowances to
              Sheriffs and county Clerks - (shall not exceed $100 a year in the aggregate) was taken
              up and laid on the table as matter superceded by the passage of another bill. 

          
          

          
            TERM IN STATE'S PRISONS.

            Mr. Hutson's bill [H.R. 198] to amend the 19th section of the felony act of June
              10, 1852, was read the third time.

            Mr. WELBORN said he thought the bill a very good one. As the law now stands the jury
              could not send a person convicted of grand larceny to the State's prison for less
              than two years. By this bill it was proposed that they might send for one year. It
              would relieve both court and jury from frequent embarrassments; and, he would mention,
              that such legislation, he believed, was recommended by the Governor.

            The bill was finally passed the House of Representatives - yeas 72, nays 0. 

          
          

          
            TAX TITLE - LIMITATION.

            Mr. Shoemaker's bill [H. R. 152] to limit the time for commencing action for the
              recovery of land sold for taxes, was read the third time.

            Mr. COFFROTH. The only change was as to the limitation. Under the present law the
              action may be commenced any time within twenty years, unless the party is under
              disabilities.

            The bill failed - yeas 38, nays 35 - for want of a Constitutional majority of
              fifty-one members. 

          
          

          
            GIRLS AND WOMEN - REFORMATORY.

            Mr. Stewart, of Rush's, bill [H. R. 176]
              to provide for the establishment of a Reformatory Institution for Girls and Women, was
              read the third time.

            It proposes the establishment of said Institution within five miles of Indianapolis -
              to be under the management of three persons to be appointed by the Governor and Senate
              - the Governor to receive a donation of land for the purpose - the Institution to be
              divided into two departments - the one reformatory, the other penal - both to be under
              the management of the same officers, who shall be females - and it appropriates
              $50,000 for the purpose.

            

            Mr. STEWART, of Rush, said this long bill is a very important one. He merely wished
              to say that the best minds in the State, in the different professions of life, have
              been consulted, and have had a hand in drawing this bill; aad he hoped that the
              character of the attention it has received would commend it favorably to the attention
              of the House.

            Mr. McFADIN. After what particular model was it drawn?

            Mr. STEWART. It has been drawn after no model particularily; but, as he had stated,
              men of the different professions have been consulted, and we have tried to make of it
              a model institution of our own; and we hope it will be better than any other.

            Mr. COFFROTH. What would be the probable cost of the institution?

            Mr. STEWART. The amount it proposes to appropriate is $50,000, till the next meeting
              of the Legislature; and we hope that it will be sufficient to complete the
              institution.

            Mr. COFFROTH indulged the hope that the bill will not pass. It proposes to
              appropriate $50,000, and the hope is expressed that will be sufficient to construct
              the building. Just as it was at the time of the first appropriation for the Northern
              Prison; and now ten or twelve year afterwards, we are still asked to make further
              appropriations for the construction of that building. He opposed the bill at some
              length - alleging that the fact that there are but sixteen women now confined in the
              prisons of the State, did not warrant the construction of another prison.

            Mr. WELBORN spoke at length in favor of the bill and in reply to Mr. Coffroth.

            Mr. BOWEN also was heard in favor of the passage of the bill.

            Mr. JOHNSON, of Parke, submitted opposing considerations.

            Mr. STANTON spoke for the passage of the bill - replying specially to the objections
              taken by Mr. McFadin - showing at length the benevolence of the proposition, and
              refering to the fact that benevolent individuals of the State are proposing to assume
              the management of the institution without any present charge for their services.

            Mr. COFFROTH demanded the previous question, which was sustained, and under its force
              the final vote on the bill was taken and resulted - yeas 32, nays 41 - as follows:

            Mr. RUDDELL, explaining. He believed that there is an absolute necessity for such
              institution; that it was evinced by the outrages and inhumanities committed in the
              Prison South. He would vote aye, if the bill proposed an appropriation of three times
              the amount it contained.

            So the bill was rejected.

            Mr. COFFROTH moved to reconsider the vote, and to lay that motion on the table.

            Pending which -

            On motion of Mr. RUDDELL, the House took a recess till 2 o'clock P.M. 

          
          

          
            AFTERNOON SESSION.

            On motion of Mr. WELBORN, the Senate amendment to his bill [H. R. 90] creating the Twenty-fifth Judicial
              Circuit, (establishing a Criminal Court for the county of Vanderburgh,) proposing to
              include a provision for a Criminal Court for Jefferson county, and amending the title
              so as to read Twenty-eighth and Twenty-ninth Circuits, was taken up.

            Mr. JOHNSON, of Marshall, opposed the amendment and the bill, on the score of the
              expensiveness of the multiplication of these courts. He desired that the proposition
              should go to the Committee on the Organization of Courts.

            Mr. OVERMYER proposed to amend the Senate's amendment by requirement the
              Prosecuting Attorney of the Civil Court for Jefferson county the serve as Prosecuting
              Attorney for the Criminal Court for aid county; which was adopted.

            And then the Senate's amendment was non-concurred in - yeas 36, nays 37.

            Ordered that the Clerk inform the Senate.

            On motion of Mr. RUDDELL, the Senate amendments to his bill [H. R. 72], defining what counties shall constitute
              the Fifth Judicial Circuit, and fixing the time of holding court therein, were taken
              up and concurred in. [This bill respects what is called the Marion Circuit.] 

          

          
            JUSTICES' JURISDICTION.

            Mr. Williams' (of Knox) bill [H. R. 31] to amend the 9th section of the
              Justices' act, now amended so as to authorize suits to be brought in townships
              where the debt is contracted, to the amount of $25, was taken up as the special order
              - the pending question being on Mr. Odell's amendment to strike out
              "25," and insert "50" in lieu. 

            

            Mr. WILLIAMS, of Knox, moved that (he subject be indefinitely postponed.

            On motion of Mr. OSBORN, Mr. Williams' motion was laid on the table-yeas 13,
              nays 37-and the question recurred on Mr. Odell s amendment.

            Mr. STEWART, of Rush, moved ineffectually to lay Mr. Odell's amendment on the
              table-yeas 32, nays 43; and the question recurred again on Mr. Odell's amendment,
              which was adopted without a division; and the question recurred on the amendment oi
              the committee as amended.

            Mr. WILLIAMS, of Knox, spoke against the bill, as now amended, as a proposition that
              must work great hardships-as legislation to favor the few at the expense of the many.
              It was asked for by no petition; and he hoped vet that it would be rejected.

            Mr. RATLIFF concurred with Mr. Williams, as a proposition to change a law that has so
              long worked well. It would work oppressively against the poorer classes.

            Mr. VATER considered, on the contrary, that it would work for the advantage of the
              poor man, by procuring for him, perchance, a denial of credit. Then he argued, that
              the bill was a proposition to compel the fulfillment of contracts in these cases of
              credits for small amounts.

            And then, under the force of the previous question, the reported amendment as
              amended, was rejected-yeas 33, nays 42, as follows:

            Mr. WILLIAMS, of Knox, then desired to move indefinite postponement; but the motion
              was ruled out, because it had been just passed upon.

            On motion of Mr. COTTON the bill was then laid upon the table, by yeas, 43, nays 32. 

          
          

          
            THE STATE PRISONS.

            Mr. RUDDELL (by a dispensation) introduced a bill [H. R. 387] to provide for the
              government and discipline of the State prisons, and for the oversight of the county
              jails, and to repeal all laws in conflict therewith.

            It proposes to place the State prisons and county jails under the supervision of a
              Board of Managers, to be appointed by the Governor, of whom the Governor, the Chief
              Justice of the Supreme Court, and the United States District Judge for the District of
              the State of Indiana, are to members ex-officio, etc.

            It was read and referred to the Committee on State Prisons. 

          
          

          
            DIVORCE LAWS.

            On the motion of Mr. OSBORN the bill [S. 316] for amendment of the divorce laws was
              taken up and read-the bill [S. 317] to prevent divorce frauds, was taken up read; and
              they were both referred to Committee on the Judiciary. 

          
          

          
            COUNTY SEATS-RE-LOCATION.

            On motion of Mr. RATLIFF, Mr. Bobo's bill [H. R. 325] to provide for the
              relocation of county seats and the erection public buildings, in case of such
              relocation etc. [when two-thirds of the tax payers shall petition-procure the
              conveyance of 2 acres for the Court House, one-fourth of an acre for the jail, and
              deposit $100 to pay architect, etc.,] was taken up-yeas nays 36and it was read the

            Mr. Odell's married woman bill [H. 208]; Mr. Cory's county R. R. bill
              latter being amended by the committee porting thereon so so as to provide that i more
              than $10,000 shall be appropriated any one railroad, were ordered to the
              engrossment.

            Mr. Ruddell's bill [H. R. 157] to regulate the publication of legal
              advertisements was taken up and failed on the motion i an order to engross.

            The House of Refuge appropriation bill [H. R. 261] was laid on the table, as the
              matter was superceded by an item in the general appropriation bill.

            The Supervisors' Election bill (makin the election at the general biennial
              election) was taken up and read the second time.

            Mr. ODELL proposed to amend by making the compensation $1.50, instead of $1 which was
              adopted.

            Mr. BOBO proposed to add a penalty five dollars for voting for a Supervisor out of
              the voter's road district.

            Mr. STEWART, of Rush, moved ineffectually to lay this amendment on the table.

            The amendment was then adopted.

            Mr. WILLIAMS, of Knox, proposed recommit the bill, with instructions amend by
              requiring the supervisors to appointed by the township trustees.

            Mr. Higgins and Mr. Davidson opposed and Mr. Ruddell supported the proposition and

            Mr. VATER explained the justice of the bill.

              said amendment.

            Mr. OSBORN proposed further to amend the bill by striking out the words
              "Bloomington, Monroe County," and "State University," wherever
              they occur.

            Speeches were made by Mr. Osborn and Mr. Buskirk. When the latter had concluded-

          The Senate-met at 9 o'clock, A. M.

          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR announced the special order, viz: the bill [S. 338] defining
            what counties shall constitute the Tenth Judicial Circuit, which was read the second
            time.

          Mr. FISHER moved to amend by inserting a provision that the counties of Miami, Wabash
            and Fulton shall constitute the Twenty-second Judicial Circuit, and annexing Pulaski and
            Starke counties to the Eleventh Judicial Circuit.

          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR decided this proposition out of order as an amendment. It would
            be entertained by the Chair in the form of a substitute.

          Mr. CARSON moved to strike from the bill all that relates to adjourned terms of the
            Alien County Courts.

          The amendment was agreed to.

          On motion by Mr. SMITH, the Constitutional restriction was dispensed with. The bill was
            again read and passed the Senate by yeas 37, nays 0. 

          
            PARTITION OF LANDS.

            Mr. Denbo's bill [S. 51], to amend
              section 9, and repealing part of section 16, of an act relating to the partition of
              lands, approved May 20, 1852, was taken up.

            Mr. DENBO explained that it was to save expense in the matters of partition. It
              provides that the Court may appoint a commissioner to sell the lands, where they can
              not be'sub-divided.

            

            The bill was read the third time and passed, by yeas 31, nays 4. 

          
          

          
            GOVERNMENT OF PRISONS.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR announced the special order for this hour to be the
              consideration of the Prison bill [S. 120], and the accompanying committee report,
              recommending the adoption of a substitute therefor.

            Mr. RICE moved to lay the bill on the table, and that 100 copies be printed for the
              use of the Senate.

            The motion was agreed to by yeas 21, nays 15.

            Mr. KINLEY moved to make the bill the special order for Friday at 10 o'clock A. M.
            

            Mr. RICE preferred to wait till the bill is printed and laid on our tables, before it
              shall be set as the order for any special hour. It may be considered advisable to let
              the bill remain on the table. He moved to lay the motion on the table.

            The motion to lay on the table was rejected by yeas 14, nays 22.

            The motion to make the bill the special order for Friday at 10 o'clock was
              agreed to by yeas 19, nays 18. 

          
          

          
            BILLS OF EXCEPTIONS.

            The PRESIDENT pro tem. [Mr. Gray in the chair] announced the
              consideration of Mr. Bradley's bill [S. 164] to authorize the amendment of bills
              of exceptions in certain cases; and it was read the third time.

            Mr. HANNA explained that the bill permitted an amendment of bills of exceptions after
              term time in cases of omissions, &c.

            Mr. HUMPHREYS understood the bill was introduced to cover a case in which one of his
              constituents is interested. It has gone up to the Supreme Court, and if this bill is
              passed it would operate as a great hardship in the case referred to. In justice to
              that constituent he hoped the bill would not pass. He moved that it be indefinitely
              postponed.

            Mr. SCOTT had a similar understanding of the object of this bill, and expressed his
              oposition to it.

            Mr. STEIN was favorable to the passage of the bill. If a bill now on the file,
              providing that this class of legislation shall not be retroactive, shall pass, the
              objection named will be removed, of course. It may be that the fear of injuring one
              case will cause votes to be csst against this bill, but he apprehended that the fears
              expressed were groundless, for if the case referred to is pending in the Supreme
              Court, the bill of exceptions is already made up, and the passage-of this law will
              riot affect it. At any rate we should riot be deterred from our duty, because of an
              exceptional case. He defended the principle upon which the bill is based.

            Mr. SCOTT asked for unanimous consent to amend the bill so that it shall apply only
              to the future.

            Mr. HANNA did not give consent. He spoke in favor of the bill.

            Mr. RICE insisted that the Legislate should not come in and cure defects, 0, correct
              mistakes of attorneys, in making up their bills of exceptions, or in any other
              matters.

            The motion to indefinitely postpone the bill was rejected by yeas 15, nays 20.

            Mr. WOLCOTT regarded this as a bill not for the benefit of attorneys but parties
              litigant.

            It failed to pass the Senate for want of a Constitutional majority of 26-yeas 21 nays
              14. 

          
          

          
            THE SCHOOL LAW.

            Mr. Huffman's bill [S. 9] to amend section 27 of the Common School law of March
              6th, 1865, was read the second time.

            Mr. BELLAMY offered a substitute for section 1, that when such meeting shall petition
              in regard to repairs, removal or erection of a school house, an estimate shall be
              furnished of the probable cost, &c.

            The substitute was adopted.

            Mr. HANNA offered an amendment, which was agreed to, that if the site selected be
              within forty rods of the dwelling house the power to condemn shall not be
              applicable.

            The bill was ordered to be engrossed. 

          
          

          
            MARION AND HENDRICKS COURTS.

            The bill [H. R. 64] defining what counties
              shall constitute the Twelfth Common Pleas District was read the second time, with
              pending amendments which were agreed to.

            Mr. CAVIN moved that the Constitutional restriction be dispensed with in order that
              the bill may be passed now.

            The motion was agreed to, the bill read the third time, and passed the by yeas 34,
              nays 0.

            And then came the recess for dinner. 

          
          

          
            AFTERNOON SESSION.

            On motion by Mr. CRAVENS, the Senate adhered to its amendments to the Criminal
              Circuit Court bill [H. R. 90], and asked for a
              Committee of Conference thereon. 

            The bill [H. R. 143] supplemental to the act concerning the running at large of
              animals, approved May 31, 1852, coming up under an order for the consideration of
              numerous bills designated by several Senators, it was read the second time and passed
              to third reading. 

            The bill [H. R. 341] creating the 28th Judical
              Circuit, corning up under the same order, it was read the third time. 

            

            Mr. HENDERSON explained that Johnson county had been legislated out of any Court at
              all, and that the attorneys and people of Morgan county preferred to remain in the
              Circuit they have been in. He desired the rule suspened so that the bill may be read
              the second time as he desired to strike Morgan county out of it.

            Mr. ROBINSON, of Decatur, had no objection to the location of this new circuit. There
              is probably really a neccessity for it, but he desired his circuit to remain as it is,
              consequently he opposed the amendment indicated by Mr. Henderson.

            The motion to dispense with the Constitutional restriction was agreed to, and the
              bill was read the second time.

            Mr. HENDERSON moved to amend the bill by striking out Morgan county, and all that
              relates thereto.

            Mr. ROBINSON, of Decatur, moved to refer the bill to a select committee to be
              composed of Senators interested.

            Mr. HANNA moved to refer the bill to the Committee on Organization of
                Courts, with instructions to inquire into the expediency of adding Johnson
              county to the Fourth Circuit, and striking out the balance of the bill.

            Mr. HENDERSON preferred to see the bill pass as it is.

            The motion to refer with instructions was agreed to.

            Mr. Stein's bill [S. 215] to authorize
              county and townships to take stock in and make donations to railroad companies, coming
              up under the omnibus special order of business, it was read the third time.

            Mr. HANNA raised two constitutional objections to the bill-and read a part of two
              sections in that instrument, with which he said the bill conflicted.

            Mr. STEIN declared that the bill was drafted in view of the constitutional sections
              referred to by Mr. Hanna, and that ii was not obnoxious to those or to any other
              constitutional provision. He re-read several sections of the bill and explained their
              Provisions. He also read a brief, prepared by an eminent lawyer, reviewing the
              constitutional questions that affect the bill, paving answered the constitutional
              objection urged against the bill, he proceed a to state reasons for its passage, as a
              matter of policy.

            Mr. HANNA, although interested in the passage of a measure of this kind, could not
              extend to it his support while satisfied that is in direct conflict with the State
              Constitution. And he proceeded to compare several clauses in the bill with several
              provisions of the Constitution to substantiate his declaration that this measure does
              run counter to the organic law of the State.

            Mr. GRAY doubted the Constitutionality of the bill; and opposed it for the additional
              reason that it would tax in many counties those not liable to taxation as well as
              those who are.

            Mr. CARSON also doubted its constitutionality, but should vote for the bill.

            It passed the Senate by yeas 30, nays 6.

            The bill [H. R. 53] to regulate the mileage of
              Sheriffs in conveying convicts to the State's Prisons, being the next in the
              series, was read the first time.

            Mr. JOHNSON, of Spencer, moved that the rule be suspended that the bill may be
              pressed to its final passage.

            Mr. FISHER noticed a great many imperfections in the bill and hoped it would be sent
              to a committee.

            Mr. JOHNSON, of Spencer, withdrew his motion.

            The bill was passed to the second reading.

            The bill [H. R. 100] to amend section 10 of the Justices' act of June 9, 1852,
              was read the second time and referred to the Judiciary
              Committee.

            Mr. Hess' bill [S. 75], to protect the citizens of Indiana from empiricism, and
              to elevate the standing of the medical profession, having previously failed to
                pass-April 20-for want of a Constitutional majority, was again put upon
              its passage.

            The bill passed the Senate by yeas 28, nays 9.

            Mr. Armstrong's bill [S. 310] to establish uniformity in the measurement of
              lime, was read the third time.

            Mr. WOLCOTT said the lime burners give 80 pounds to the bushel in his section, and it
              would be better to make the maximum weight the standard. He asked, but railed to
              obtain, unanimous consent to amend the bill by striking out "70" and
              inserting "80" in lieu.

            Mr. ARMSTRONG stated that bill was drawn up in the interest of those who are dealing
              largely in lime. He understood 70 pounds was the standard bushel in Ohio, ind by this
              bill he desired to obtain uniformity throughout the State.

            Mr. ROBINSON, of Decatur, thought this bill might do great injustice to some
              sections. He preferred to let the matter regulate itself.

            Mr. CARSON asked, and obtained unanimous consent, to strike from the bill the
              emergency clause.

            The bill failed to pass for want of a constitutional majority - yeas 20, nays 15.

            The bill [H. R. 310] touching vacancies in county and township [offices?] was read the second time.

            Mr. TURNER moved to dispense with the constitutional restriction in order that the
              bill may be read the third time now.

            Mr. ROBINSON, of Madison, understood that this bill was intended to obtain an
              appointment by the County Commissioners of  Allen
              county of an Auditor of that county to hold over until the election of 1870 under the
              new law.

            Mr. TURNER would be frank enough to say that he imagined the Democratic counties
              desired Democratic Commissioners to fill any vacancies that may occur in those
              counties, and not allow these appointments to be made by the Governor of the
              State.

            Mr. ROBINSON, of Madison, for that reason opposed the bill, and moved its reference
              to the Judiciary Committee.

            Mr. CHURCH was inclined to think that he should favor the bill, but would vote for
              its reference to the Committee.

            The motion to refer was agreed to by yeas 20, nays 15.

            Mr. Scott's bill [S. 188] to provide for the sale of certain State lands in the
              county of Clay, was read the third time.

            Mr. SCOTT stated that there was but 13 1/3 acres of this land, and he knew of no law
              that would grant a partition to the joint owner of the tract. He held in his hand the
              opinion of the Attorney General, on the title of the State to this land; which should
              be read, if any Senator desired.

            Mr. TURNER opposed a sale of this land at this time. It was rising in value rapidly,
              and there was a proposition to move the county seat near to it. He moved to refer the
              bill to the Committee on Rights and Privileges of the inhabitants of the
                State.

            Mr. CARSON demanded the previous question. The demand was seconded by the Senate, and
              under the operations of the previous question-

            The motion to refer was rejected by yeas 17, nays 19.

            The bill failed to pass for want of a Constitutional majority-yeas 24, nays 12.

            Mr. Gray's bill [S. 153] to amend section 7 of the act for the election and
              appointment of supervisors of Highways, approved March 5th, 1859, was read the second
              time, and passed to the third reading.

            Mr. Wolcotts's bill [S. 285] to amend section 1 of the act incorporating the
              University of Notre Dame Du Lac, at South Bend, St. Joseph county, Indiana, approved
              January 15, 1844, was read the third time, with the committee amendments striking out
              "320" and inserting in lieu "20" acres-exempt from taxation.

            Mr. WOLCOTT stated that all the University asked for is permission to hold $100,000
              in real estate, instead of $30,000. The friends of the bill ask that the committee
              amendment be rejected, or that all that refers to exemption be stricken from the bill.
              He moved to strike from the bill all that refers to exemption from taxation.

            Mr. RICE stated that with the consent of the President of the Institution, and a
              friend present before the committee, amendment was agreed to.

            Mr. TURNER was inclined to think University has a right to claim the exemption
              granted to other institutions of like character. He hoped Senators not discriminate
              against this institution simply because it is a Catholic College Let us do equally
              with all institutions of learning, whether they be conducted by Catholics, or
              Methodists, or any other denomination.

            Mr. CARSON presented considerations which influenced the committee in recommending
              this amendment. He was willing to deal liberally with all such institutions and should
              vote for the amendment offered by Mr. Wolcott.

            The amendment (Mr. Wolcott's) was agreed to.

            The bill passed the Senate by yeas 31, nays 4.

            A committee bill [S. 212] to repeal section 3 of the plank road law of March 1 1867,
              was read the second time and ordered engrossed for the third reading.

            The bill [H. R. 132] to enable cities to aid
              in the construction of railroads and water powers was read the third time.

            Mr. CARSON asked and obtained unanimous consent to amend the bill by requiring a
              majority of resident freeholders to join in the petition.

            The bill passed by yeas 34, nays 1.

            On motion by Mr. JAQUESS, the bill [H. R. 6]
              providing for the location, construction and use of lateral railroads was read the
              third time and passed the Senate by yeas 28, nays 9.

            And then the Senate adjourned. 

          
          

        
        

        
          HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.

          Mr. FULLER moved ineffectually to suspend the orders and take up the Agricultural
            College bill, [H. R. 347,] and the report of the special committee thereon; yeas 29,
            nays 39. 

          
            NICHOLAS MOREBACK.

            The SPEAKER laid before the House a message from the Governor vetoing the bill, [H.
              R. 139,] reported from the Committee on Rights and Privileges on
              the 13th of February, 1869, entitled, an act for the relief of Nicholas Moreback,
              Joseph E. Lang, and Francis Joseph Wetzler, (of Jackson township, Ripley county, to
              save said Moreback, and said Lang and Wetzler, his securities, from a judgment for
              township school money stolen from Trustee Moreback's custody.) -the question
              being: will the House pass the bill, the veto to the contrary, notwithstanding?

            

            Mr. WILLSON said the ground of the veto was that the General Assembly can not release
              this judgment. He was not satisfied with the reasonings of His Excellency. There were
              precedents of legislation of this kind all over the country. There was no authority in
              the bond of the Trustee, except that conferred by the legislature. Whence then, but in
              the Legislature, is the power to revoke and release this judgement? He opposed the
              opinion of eminent lawyers to that of the Governor, and defended the General Assembly
              from His Excellency's imputation that the passage of this bill was an act of
              inconsiderate and hasty legislation. 

            Mr. COFFROTH did not discuss the question, but submitted the opinion that the
              Governor in the veto is clearly wrong. He hoped the bill would pass, notwithstanding
              the veto. He recited the facts on which the bill is founded. It was an act of simple
              justice and humanity toward Moreback.

            Mr. OSBORN answered the plea that this bill was made a matter of petition from
              Jackson township, by showing how readily such petitions are gotten up. The Judiciary
              Committee, he said, passed upon the propriety and justice of the bill more than upon
              the question of the power to pass it. He opposed the bill because it would set a bad
              precedent which would bring up here hundreds of claims as meritorious as this. The
              application for this bill here was not for legitimate legislation, but to render a
              decree to set aside a judgment.

            Mr. COFFROTH. The State is guardian of the people, and the township but the agent of
              the State.

            Mr. OSBORN. The people were the State, the General Assembly but representatives of
              the people-the State. He discussed the question at length. He insisted that the
              Governor's suggestions were good, and hoped they would receive due
              consideration.

            Mr. PIERCE, of Vigo, confessed that the case of Moreback was of a class that always
              awakened his sympathies. Moreback was a faithful custodian, and the loss of the money
              was by burglars; and the question was, whether the State will sweep away this
              man's home for no wrong of his own? He replied to the plea, that there is a
              judgment of the Court in the case, and to the reasoning in the veto. No man questioned
              the right of the Governor to exercise the Pardoning power.

            Mr. OSBORN. That power was conferred by the Constitution.

            Mr. PIERCE. But the people made the Constitution. He continued, insisting that bill
              is right, appealing to every man's sense of justice. This same principle of
              Justice, equity and law obtaining also between individuals, where loss is sustained
              without the fault of the agent. If this man was guilty of no wrong, it was the duty of
              the Legislature to say to him: You shall pay no damages, etc.

            Mr. DAVIDSON replied to Mr. Willson and Mr. Coffroth, and proceeded to look at the
              question from the stand point of law. If officers were not to account for their
              custodianship, where was the necessity for official bonds? Let the people of Jackson
              township put their hands into their own pockets and relieve this man, instead of
              asking the Legislature to relieve him by setting a precedent that would be ruinous to
              the State. The House should not open a door for successful rascality in office. He
              recited three cases of robbery of public money in the hands of county officers,
              Treasurers and Trustees in his region, equally as meritorious as this, who sought no
              relief in this direction.

            Mr. WILDMAN demand the previous question, and under its force, the vote on the
              question resulted-yeas 36, nays 47-as follows:

            
              
                
                  YEAS-Messrs. Barnett, Barritt, Bobo, Bowen. Carnahan,
                    Chittenden, Coffroth, Cory, Dittemore, Fairchild. Hamilton, Hyatt, Johnson, of
                    Parke, Lawler, Lanborn, McBride, McDonanld. McFadin, McGregor, Miles, Mitchell,
                    Neff, Odell, Palmer, Pierce of Porter, Pierce of Vigo, Shoaff, Sleeth, Stewart
                    of Ohio, Sunman, Tebbs, Underwood, Wile, Wilson, Zollars and Mr. Speaker-36.

                  NAYS-Messrs. Addison, Admire, Baker, Bates, Beatty, Britton,
                    Breckinridge, Chapman, Davidson, Davis of Floyd, Dunn, Field of Lake, Field of
                    Lagrange, Fuller, Gilham, Gordon, Greene. Hall, Higbee, Higgins, Hutson, Johnson
                    of Marshall, Jump, Kercheval, Logan, Long, Mason, Millekan, Miller, Montgomery,
                    Osborn, Overmyer, Ratliff, Ruddell, Sabin, Skidmore, Smith, Stewart of Rush,
                    Taber, Vardeman, Vater, Wildman, Williams of Hamilton, Williams of Knox,
                    Williams of St. Joseph, Williams of Union, and Zenor-45,
                
              
            

            So the vote was sustained-Mr. DUNN explaining. He had from the beginning been opposed
              to making allowances of this character; but up to this time he had sustained this
              bill. But now, believing that if the Governor's veto be sustained it will put a
              stop to the bringing in of these claims, he voted no

            Mr. CHITTENDEN submitted the following:

            Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring).
              That the two houses will meet in the hall of the House of Representatives at 2
              o'clock on Thursday, the 28th instant, and proceed, without delay, to ballot for
              the location of the Agricultural College; and that the point receiving the lowest
              number de dropped at the end of each ballot, until a location shall be obtained.

            Objection being made, the resolution could not be entertained.

            Mr. McFADIN spoke against a night session for determining this Agricultural College
              question.

            On motion of Mr. DITTEMORE, Mr. Carnahan's resolution was laid on the table
              affirmative 46, negative not counted.

            Mr. McFADIN moved to make the Agricultural bill the special order for to-morrow at 2

            Mr. DUNN proposed a substitute, that the bill be made the special order for 3

              amendment was adopted

            Mr. COFFROTH, Mr. STANTON and others contended that the vote is not yet final,
              insisting that the several propositions for the location should be heard before the

              resolution as amended, and they were ordered.

              propositions and claims of the counties of Marion, Tippecanoe and Hancock before the
              ballot shall be taken.

            Mr. DAVIS, of Floyd, acquiesced in the understanding, supposing it to be general.

            The SPEAKER ruled that it could hardly be in order to entertain explanations under
              the previous question.

            The resolution, as amended, (to proceed at once to ballot for the location,) was
              adopted-yeas 61, nays 24.

            Subsequently this order was rescinded and another proposed by Mr. Dunn, and amended
              by Mr. Coffroth, was adopted, to the following effect:

            
              
                
                  Resolved, That any member from such counties as have
                    propositions before the General Assembly in reference to the location of th
                    Agricultural College be now allowed twenty minutes to discuss the question.

                  Resolved, That we then proceed to vote by ballot for the
                    location of the Agricultural College.
                
              
            

            Mr. STANTON presented a proposition for the location in the county of Marion; the
              Trustees of the Northwestern Christian University proposing the free use of their
              University grounds and buildings for the connection of the Agricultural College with
              that Institution, the whole to be under the supervision of seven Trustees-three to be
              selected by the University and three by the General Assembly and the remaining one by
              those six. The money value of the inducements and donations offered by Marion county
              he summed up thus: The buildings and grounds of the Northwestern Christian University
              $175,000; the endowment of that, institution $110,000; the Marion county cash donation
              $100,000; the twenty-seven acre adjoining the Northwestern Christian University,

              the Tippecanoe Battle Ground.

            Mr. CORY presented the proposed donations and the claims for the location al
              Greenfield, in Hancock county.

            Mr. NEFF recounted the Putnam county donation and the advantages of the location of
              the Agricultural College in the vicinity of Greencastle, deprecating every proposition
              for its connection with any other institution of learning. When he had concluded-

            Mr. BUSKIRK, [Mr. Johnson, of Park, in the chair.] followed, setting forth the
              donations and inducements for the location at Bioomington in connection with the State
              University. When he had concluded,

            Mr. GREENE, by leave, submitted the 
              considerations, in favor of the separate establishment of the Agricultural college,
              herein seconding the views with regard to the separate location taken by Mr. Gory and
              Mr. Neff, and he submitted additional considerations in favor of accepting the
              donation of Howard county, and making the location thereon in the vicinity of
              Greenfield.

            The SPEAKER, announced the order for the ballot and appointed Messrs. Stewart, of

            yesterday was dispensed with. 

          
            PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS.

            Mr. CRAVENS presented a petition from citizens of Jefferson county praying for the
              paying of the Morgan raid claims by the State.

            Mr. DENBO presented a similar petition signed by several hundred citizens Of
              Washington county.

            Messrs. HUFFMAN and BELLAMY presented similar petitions.

            Mr. HENDERSON presented a memorial from members of the bar of Morgan county praying
              that said county may not be taken from its old Judicial Court Circuits.

            Mr. ANDREWS presented a petition from 1,400 citizens of Jennings county praying For
              payment by the State of the Morgan raid claims.

            These petitions were severally referred to appropriate committees. 

          
          

          
            NEW PROPOSITION.

             A committee returned a new bill [S. 343] for an act supplemental to the
              just-valuation-for-taxation act of December, 1865 (prepared by the Governor and
              Auditor of State), recommending its passage. It was read the first time and passed to
              the second reading. 

          
          

          
            OLD INTERNAL IMPROVEMENT BONDS.

             Mr. CARSON offered a concurrent resolution that the action of the Governor and the
              Adjutant General, in settling the claims of the General Government against the State
              by taking up old Internal Improvement bonds, was unauthorized by law, and that the
              State should make no provision for paying the old Internal Improvement debt except as
              provided in the Butler bill; and that he action of the Governor and Adjutant General
              in the settlement of $250,000 advanced to Governor Morton by the President of the
              United States was unauthorized; and that no legislation sanctioning the same should be
              entertained. He spoke in favor of the adoption of these resolutions as necessary to
              relieve the State from large claims that are ready to be brought in against the State,
              based upon these unauthorized acts of the Governor. He reviewed the history of this
              matter, reflecting severely upon the action of Governor Murton and Governor Baker in
              the premises.

            Mr. FISHER replied-stating what he understood to be the facts in the case, to justify
              the acts of the Executive in this settlement. He insisted the Governor's action
              was more than justifiable. He understood that these bonds were not yet cancelled-not
              destroyed at any rate-and that the State could require the Trustees of the Erie Canal
              to issue stock to one-ban the amount, or the State can hold them just as they are.

            Mr. SCOTT moved to refer these resolutions to the Committee on Federal
                Relations.

            Mr. TURNER did riot like to see a disposition here to cover up the action of State
              officials; and this matter, he thought, should be ventilated thoroughly.

            

            Mr. CARSON moved to make the resolution the special order for this afternoon at 2 o
              clock.

            Mr. WOLCOTT moved to indefinitely postpone the resolution. We are near the end of the
              session; and this matter had better be put out of the way at once.

            Mr. RICE was not prepared to vote on this question to-day. He would prefer to see the
              resolutions take the usual course. To indefinitely postpone them would look too much
              like a disposition to cover up.

            Mr. HANNA insisted that there was no law authorizing this settlement; it was an act
              of usurpation on the part of the Governor; and he desired to say upon the record by
              yeas and nays that the Executive of the State shall not pay large sums of money
              belong-to the people without the shadow authority of law. The Executive is authorized
              to execute the laws, and nothing more; then why should we sanction this usurpation? He
              did not object to reference of these resolutions to a committee.

            Mr. SCOTT did not make his motion with a desire to smother the resolutions. The two
              questions are: The power of the Governor to make the settlement, and second, the
              liability of the State to pay the debt. He contended that if the holders of the bonds
              never consented to the provisions of the Butler bill they are not bound by it. A
              committee should investigate as to whether the Governor did or did not usurp power in
              this matter, and, for one, if it is found that the Executive exceeded authority he
              (Mr. S.) would say so, as soon as such is ascertained to be the fact.

            Mr. TURNER was willing to a reference of these resoulutions if the committee were
              instructed to report to-morrow afternoon. He read from the Governor's message to
              show the Executive himself, seemed to be of the opinion that he had exceeded his
              authority in this matter. If the State would be compromised by paying the $196,000
              referred to in the message, would not the State be compromised by countenancing this
              illegal actor the Governor? At his suggestion Mr. Carson modified his motion so as to
              make his resolutions the special order for to-morrow afternoon in Committee of the
              Whole Senate.

            Mr. HANNA regarded this action of the Governor, if acquiesced in by the Legislate, as
              only an entering wedge for the Payment of about eight millions of dollars or the
              entire amount of outstanding old Internal Improvement bonds. And he charged the
              Senator from White, [Mr. Wolcott,] with trying to repudiate a portion of this debt,
              while trying to sanction the action of the Governor in paying another portion. Why is
              it that a portion of this debt is more sacred than another portion? The holders of
              these bonds refused to assist us;these very men held back and would not lend us a
              helping hand in the darkest hours of 1847-8and yet the Governor says they shall be
              paid in full; and the Senator from White moves to indefinitely postpone any
              proposition to inquire into the Governor's conduct!-the demands, as a partizan,
              that we shall not investigate this subject at all!

            Mr. FISHER said that this matter has got into an interesting condition. The Governor
              thought the passage of a law, making any other provision than that contemplated in the
              act of 1846-7, might compromise the State with regard to that whole debt. Here is a
              party owing us money, and will pay it if we take these bonds. The Governor took them.
              This is not a resolution to approbate the action of the Governor, by no means. It is a
              resolution censuring him, and if you don't vote for that, the Senator from
              Sullivan [Mr. Hanna] says you lay yourselves liable to pay all this great internal
              improvement debt; and if you don't censure the Governor, you are in favor of the
              assumption of this old debt. That is great logic.

            Mr. TURNER. How can we abrogate this debt? The money is paid over. Have we the power
              to compel the paying of it back?

            Mr. FISHER supposed we have not. But what could be done with the General Government
              when it said to the State: We won't pay you unless you take your note; here it
              is; you may take that or go to the dogs?

            Mr. TURNER. The Government of the United States never refused to pay allowed
              claims.

            Mr. FISHER. Unquestionably it did, unless you allowed a set-off.

            Mr. TURNER. Our Governor held no authority of law for paying these bonds, even if we
              never got our pay from the General Government.

            Mr. FISHER. Then the claim of the Government would be running on interest, and our
              claim against the Government would not. It is a clear, plain case, and the advantage
              to the State is clear and prominent. The power of the Governor to do it is a question
              he was not going to argue at all. He was not seeking to approbate the Governor, but
              what he was speaking of is this: While this resolution was introduced for the purpose
              of censuring the Governor, the threat is held over those who might be supposed to
              approbate the action of the Governor, that unless you vote this censure and
              condemnation upon the Governor you expose the State to the payment of this vast
              debt.

            

            Mr. WOLCOTT contended that Governor Baker's settlement in no way affected the
              bonds cancelled under the arrangements of the Butler bill. The original bonds
              remaining uncancelled are still obligations against the State, and the difference
              between the two classes of indebtedness are as different and distinct as it is
              possible to conceive. The action of the Governor, in allowing the offset to these
              bonds, even if recognized by the General Assembly, need not affect the question
              involved in the interest represented by the surrendered bonds. He denied any violation
              by the Governor of the law of 1847. He saw nothing in these resolutions but a purpose
              to sow discord and create a faction in the Republican party. It has been the policy of
              the Democratic party since the fall session to foment disturbance and discord in the
              Republican ranks, and he believed these resolutions were introduced for no other
              purpose: And as Republicans we should vote them down.

            Mr. CARSON replied to the question why these resolutions were brought before the
              Senate, by inquiring why the original resolutions on this subject were sprung upon the
              Senate at the regular session; and lie recited the history of the matter to show that
              it was certainly riot by any Democratic manooeuvring.

            Mr. CRAVENS apprehended that the-great purpose of this discussion was an organized
              and intended raid upon the present Executive. And this view was warranted by the
              declarations made by Democrats upon this floor; to which he referred. Then why censure
              the Governor of the State for having acted under authority given him by the
              Legislature? Why censure him for doing the very thing the people of Indiana declared
              he should do?-settle these claims? He spoke at length in justification of the act of
              the Executive of the State in the matters questioned by the resolutions under
              consideration. When he had concluded-

            The Senate took a recess till 2 o'clock. 

          
          

          
            AFTERNOON SESSION.

            Mr. WOOD demanded the previous question, and there being a second-

            The pending motion to indefinitely postpone Mr. Carson's resolutions as agreed
              to by yeas 20, nays 17, as follows:

            
              
                
                  YEAS-Messrs. Andrews, Beardsley, Bellamy, Caven, Church,
                    Cravens, Eliott, Fisher, Fosdick, Hadley, Hamilton, Hess, Hooper, Jaquess,
                    Johnson of Spencer, Morgan, Reynolds, Stein, Wolcott, Wood-20.

                  NAYS-Messrs. Carson, Hanna, Henderson, Howk, Huey, Huffman,
                    Humphreys, Johntson of Montgomery, Lee, Montgomery, Robinson of Madison,
                    Robinson of Decatur, Scott, Sherrod, Smith, Taggart, Turner-17.
                
              
            

            Pending the roll call-

            Mr. ANDREWS, in explanation of his vote, remarked, that he was anxious to be entirely
              liberal with our Democratic friends. He wished them to go their full length. The best
              service they can do the country is to show up the imperfections of our public men.
              After the discussion had on this subject during the regular session and here he
              thought they ought to be satisfied. Thanking them for what they have done, he voted
              "aye."

            Mr. BELLAMY, in explanation, was understood to say that if the resolutions had been
              introduced in a proper form he should have voted differently, but as the matter now
              stands he would vote "aye."

            Mr. JOHNSON, of Spencer, when his name was called, said: Mr. President: I ask the
              indulgence of the Senate while I very briefly express my views on the subject now
              under discussion. I am one of those who can see no good reason for thus hastily
              considering the action of any of our public servants. By hasty and inconsiderate
              action we may do an injury which it will take years to repair. At an early day in the
              last session of our Legislature, a few-Republicans suffered themselves to do what I
              believed to be a very unwise, and I hope you will pardon me when I say, a very foolish
              thing. I refer to the resolutions of censure of Lieutenant Governor Cumback. It was my
              private opinion then that each one of these individuals would live to repent their
              hasty and I think, indiscrete actions. I am one that does not like to shut my eyes to
              lessons of the past, The Democracy may, if they will, continue to censure our
              Republican officers, but I, for one, will decline to join with them. I prefer rather
              to indorse them all The Republicans can, surely indorse our Governor, and also our
              Lieutenant Governor, and all the rest of our public officers. When I was a candidate
              for Senator the Republicans of this State had a resolution in our State platform
              indorsing Andy Johnson, and also one indorsing Congress. I do not believe it will
              require any more stretch of conscience now than then. [Laughter.]

            Mr. ROBINSON, of Madison, when his name was called, said he believed he had never
              voted to indefinitely postpone any proposition legitimately before the Senate, and
              that he never should. If there was anything in these resolutions, he was perfectly
              willing they should be investigated by a committee. If there is nothing in them an
              investigation by a committee will amount to nothing. Therefore, he voted
              "no."

            So the motion to indefinitely postpone the resolutions was agreed to. 

          

          
            AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE,

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR laid  before the Senate
              a message from the Governor, enclosing a communication from Jesse Mehary, of
              Tippecanoe county, proposing to donate 320 acres of his farm, worth $30,000, to the
              State Agricultural College, provided that institution shall be located thereon. The
              letter of Mr. Mehary states that his neighbors are willing to give $50,000 more on the
              same conditions.

            The communication was referred to the Committee on the Agricultural
                College. 

          
          

          
            NEW PROPOSITIONS.

             Mr. HOWK, by leave, introduced a bill [S. 344] to legalize sales of guardians under
              orders defective, in that sales shall be made without notice, which was read the first
              time.

            Mr. TURNER regarded that bill as intended to affect a case of an intended removal of
              a county seat in Martin county. He moved to reject the bill.

            Mr. HOWK said he offered the bill at the request of a friend.

            The motion was rejected yeas 17, nays 21.

            The bill was then passed to the second reading.

            Mr. CRAVENS, by leave, introduced a bill [S. 345] authorizing the Boards of
              Commissioners of the several counties of this State to provide for the destruction of
              foxes therein; which was read the first time.

            By leave, Mr. GRAY also introduced a bill [S. 340] to amend section 29 of the school
              law; which was read the first time, and passed to the second reading.

            On motion by Mr. CAVEN his bill [S. 273] authorizing the issuing of arms and
              equipments to independent military companies, was read the second time.

            Mr. CAVEN made an ineffectual motion for a dispensation to read the bill the third
              time now.

            On motion by Mr. HANNA, the bill [H. R. 7] to
              authorize foreign guardians to take possession of the property of their wards >n
              this State, was read the third time, and passed by yeas 35, nays 1. 

          
          

          
            SENATE BILLS ON THE THIRD READING.

            On motion by Mr. WOOD, the Senate Proceeded to the consideration of Senate bills on
              the third reading. Mr. Green's bill [S. 98] to provide for the assessment of
              taxes for municipal purposes on bank stock, coming up -

            On motion by Mr. GRAY, it was laid on the table.

            Mr. Reynolds' bill [S. 54] empowering cities to establish public parks, and to
              acquire title to land for that purpose, coming up - it having heretofore (March 2d)
              failed to pass for want of a Constitutional majority -

            On motion by Mr. GRAY, it was read.

            The bill again failed to pass for want of a Constitutional majority, by yeas 23, nays
              14.

            Mr. Cavin's bill (S. 53,) to authorize the formation of co-operative societies,
              for the purchase and erection of dwellings and other buildings, was read for the third
              time.

            Mr. CARSON objected to the provision requiring the paying in of only one per cent, of
              the stock subscribed; and opposed the bill on other grounds.

            Mr. CAVIN explained the provisions of his bill, and as a measure much needed by the
              poorer class of persons in cities and large towns, commended it to the favorable
              consideration of Senators.

            Mr. CARSON said the Committee on Corporations came to the
              conclusion that the measure was one calculated to wrong the poor man, because there
              was no responsibility provided for in the bill.

            The bill failed to pass for want of a Constitutional majority; yeas 21, nays 15.

            Mr. Rice's bill, [S. 118,] to amend section 10 of the act of May 4, 1852,
              concerning election contests; and to provide relief in cases of contests erroneously
              commenced by reasons of the misprint of said 10th section, etc., was read the third
              time and passed the Senate by yeas 28, nays 9.

            Mr. Bradley's bill [S. 147,] creating the 9th and 12th Judicial Circuits, coming
              up-

            Oo motion by Mr. FISHER it was laid on the table in the absence of its author.

            Mr. Bellamy's bill [S. 148] to legalize the acknowledgements of instruments
              required to be recorded, taken by notaries after the expiration of their commission,
              was read the third time and passed by yeas 36, nays 1.

            Mr. JOHNSON, of Montgomery's, bill [S. 149] to amend section 17, of the act of
              March 2, 1805, concerning the fees of officers(in relation to witness fees)was read
              the third time arid passed by yeas 32, nays 7.

            Mr. Lasalle's bill [S, 162] to provide for the serving of process upon railroad
              companies was read the third time.

            Mr. CARSON would like to amend the bill so that when both parties are nonresident, at
              least two months' pay of the employe shall be free from garnishment.

            Mr. LASALLE regarded the amendment unnecessary.

            The bill passed by yeas 33, nays 2.

            Mr. CRAVENS' bill [S. 166] providing for the establisment of election precincts,
              was read the third time.

            Mr. CRAVENS explained that the bill simply provides for the establishment of election
              precincts in incorporated towns.

            It was passed by yeas 35, nays 0.

            Mr. Caven's bill [S. 172] to exempt burial grounds from liens or sale on
                execution or other process, being read the
              third time-

            Mr. ELLIOTT asked and obtained leave to offer an emergency clause.

            Mr. CARSON'suggested difficulties that might arise under this bill.

            It was passed by yeas 37, nays 1.

            Mr. Cvaen's bill [S. 173] to change the corporate name of the Widows and
              Orphan's Asylum to the Indianapolis Orphan's Home - was read the third time
              and passed by yeas 38, nays 0.

            The Senate then adjourned. 

          
          
          
          
        
        

        
          HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.

          The House met at 9 o'clock A. M., and the SPEAKER announced the
            order for reading the journal, etc. 

          
            PERSONAL.

             Mr. GORDON submitted a personal statement and explanation of his ruling in the Chair
              pending the consideration yesterday of the order for ballotting for the location of
              the Agricultural College, of which no notice was taken in these reports.

            Mr. KERCHEVAL said, it would be remembered that in what is termed "the
              suppressed testimony" in the Southern Prison investigation, there was a blank in
              the record. The other day the Evening Mirror newspaper, printed in
              this city, stated editorially that that blank should be filled with the name of Judge
              DeBruler, of his (Mr. K's.) town, an honorable and high-toned gentleman. He had
              since received a letter from Judge DeBruler, (of which he read an extract,) distinctly
              denying any knowledge either of the facts alleged or of the parties.

            Mr. DAVIS, of Floyd, took occasion to say that the name of a constituent of his, Mr.
              Jesse J. Brown, was mentioned in the testimony referred to, and he felt called upon to
              exonerate him, (as ever gentleman knowing him would), from any absurd intimation as to
              his connection with the alleged Corruptions in connection with the management of that
              prison. 

          
          

          
            REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.

             Mr. DUNN,from the Committee on the Judiciary, returned the
              Divorce bill [S. 317] (declaring it to be a felony) recommending that it be
              immediately postponed.

            Mr. OSBORN said: This report was made, in connection with another report, which he
              now obtained leave to make from the same Committe, viz: returning the bill [S. 316]
              which has not the objectionable features of the bill S. No. 317, and which requires
              the process to be served by reading, and recommending its passage.

            These bills were laid on the table.

            Mr. DUNN, from the same Committee, returned Mr. Dittemore's bill [H. R. 255]to
              save pending cases affected by the will law of 1865, recommending its passage.

            After debate by Mr. Hamilton, Mr Pierce, of Vigo, and others, it was laid on the
              table to await an adverse report from the minority of the Committee-until tomorrow
              morning.

            Mr. STEPHENSON, from the same Committee, returned Mr. Breckinridges bill [H. R. 228]
              providing for the registration of births, marriages and deaths, recommending its
              indefinite postponement.

            The report was concurred in.

            He also returned Mr. Buskirk's town school tax bill [H. R. 183] recommending its
              indefinite postponement.

            Mr. FIELD, of Lake, stated that the purport of this bill is to enable the
              Superintendent of Public Instruction to obtain school statistics.

            The report was concurred in.

            Mr. RUDDELL, from the Prison Committee, returned Mr. Beeler's
              bill [H. R. 286,] recommending its indefinite postponement.

            Mr. VATER understood that this is a bill to authorize Marion county to send her
              convicts to the Southern Prison, and thought it deserved consideration, on the ground
              of economy.

            Mr. RUDDFLL. It was true that it would cost Marion county a little more to send to
              the Northern Prison. But we should not consider this matter in the light merely of
              dollars arid cents. There was the paramount consideration of humanity. And he spoke of
              the superior prison accommodations of the Northern Prison.

            The report was concurred in.

            Mr. SABIN, from the Committee on Claims, reported against the
              allowance of the claim of Thomas W. Wiggart, which was concurred in.

            He also reported for allowance of the claim of R. D. Slater, for mileage and per diem
              for attendance as a witness before the Committee on Arbitrary
                Arrests, during the Session of the General Assembly 1863.

            The report was concurred in-yeas 59, nays 20.

            Mr. UNDERWOOD, from the Committee on Insurance, returned Mr.
              Stephenson's Insurance bill, [H. R. 376] recommending its passage, and stating
              that this bill was intended to supply the defects, and take the place of the enrolled
              act which introduced, and which passed the last Session and was vetoed by the
              Governor: He gave notice, therefore, that he should ask further consideration of this
              bill at an early day.

            Mr. LAMBORN, from the Committee on Swamp Lands, returned the bill
              [S. 270] to provide for ditching Swamp Lands, recommending its passage. 

          
          

          

          
            MUNICIPAL BANK SHARES TAX.

            Kercheval's bill [H. R. 170] to provide for the assessment and collection of
              taxes for municipal purposes on the shares owned in banks and banking associations
              doing business in this State, was taken on the third reading-it being the special
              order.

            After ineffectual motions to postpone by Mr. Zollars and others -

            Mr. BUSKIRK (Mr. Welborn in the chair) made the point of order that the rule (51)
              requires that tax bills shall be considered in Committee of the Whole, and, after
              debate - 

            The SPEAKER ruled against the point - this being not a bill for general taxation.

            Mr. McFADIN took the floor in favor of the bill replying to the speech and the
              objections urged the other day against this bill by the Senator from Parke (Mr.
              Johnston). He showed that $100,000 in United States bonds pays a tax of only $370,
              whilst the man with $100,000 invested in farms and farm stock pays a tax thereon of
              $2,449.98. He submitted a statement of figures showing the profits of national banking
              on the bonds of the United States - amounting to fifty per cent. He spoke at length,
              fortifying the bill against the legal and constitutional objection heretofore
              indicated in the debate.

            Mr. BARRITT also supposed the bill, arguing for its constitutionality, from the fact,
              that, though the principle involved was opposed by Judge Hughes in his place here at
              the session of 1867, still it had not been disturbed by the courts; and he was
              willing, still further, to risk it. When he had concluded - 

            Mr. BUSKIRK followed, discussing simply the legal question involved. It was proposed
              by this bill to tax the National and State Bank shares for municipal purposes. Under
              the law of 1861, the Supreme Court decided, in 27th Indiana, that the counties could
              not tax the stock of the National banks under the act of Congress, for the reason that
              it made an unjust discrimination against the National banks. That was remedied by the
              act of 1867. There was a decision that the National bank stock may be taxed for State
              and county purposes; not for municipal purposes. He read from the decision - 27th
              Indiana, page 338 - to show that such stock may be taxed not exceeding the rate of
              taxation assessed against the banks of the State. Otherwise the States might tax the
              National Banks out of existence - because the State banks doing business on United
              States bonds can not be taxed on such stocks. He also quoted from a late Common Pleas
              decision. The courts have held that, while the United States bonds may not be taxed,
              the shares of National Banks may be taxed by State authority, where there is no unjust
              discrimination against them. And he felt that when he convinced the House that this
              bill does make an unjust discrimination against the National Banks, he would make a
              successful point against the passage of the bill. And he proceeded to show that the
              investments in the National Banks are already taxed heavier than any description of
              personal property. And, for proof, he quoted a statement of the taxes paid by a
              Lawrenceburgh National Bank. But, as this was a begging of the question, where the
              question is simply on of authority, he proceeded to read from the charter of the Bank
              of the State of Indiana, showing by the terms thereof, that the shares of that bank
              shall never be taxed for municipal purposes. Then if the municipalities of the State
              were to tax the National Bank shares for municipal purposes, would not that be to tax
              those shares at a higher rate than the State banks and the free banks can be taxed?
              Then he suggested the difficulty and the injustice of taxing banking tax shares for
              city purposes, in cases where the owners of such shares live not in the city, but are
              scattered throughout the State.

            On motion of Mr. OSBORN, Mr. Pierce, of Vigo, was added to the special
                Railroad Committee.

            The House then took a recess till 2 o'clock. 

          
          

          
            AFTERNOON SESSION.

             Mr. Beeler's bill [H. R. 157] to regulate the publication of legal
              advertisements, heretofore indefinitely postponed, was again called up by motion, the
              vote for postponement was reconsidered, and the bill was referred to the
                Judiciary Committee. 

          

          
            MUNICIPAL BANK SHARES TAX.

             The House then resumed the consideration of Mr. Kercheval's Municipal Bank
              Shares Tax bill [H. R. 170].

            Mr. KERCHEVAL. Mr. Speaker: I was pleased to hear the honorable gentlemen from
              Monroe, (Mr. Buskirk), in his very able argument upon this bill, say that the question
              involved in its passage, is not a party or political question, but purely a question
              of law. In this opinion I fully concur, and in my argument I shall confine myself to
              that view of it.

            The taxation of the bonds and other securities of the United States, is a totally
              different question from that of proposing to tax the stock of the National Banks, in
              the hands of the individual shareholders thereof," for municipal purposes. The
              Supreme Court of the United States has repeatedly decided that the bonds of the United
              States can not be taxed by State authority, because this would be to tax a  governmental power of the United States, to-wit, the power
              to borrow money, and would place the General Government at the mercy of State
              legislation. This principle of the non-taxability of Government securities by State
              authority, has, by a recent decision of the Supreme Court, been extended to the
              greenback currency of the country, so that a man holding greenbacks can not be taxed
              thereon by State authority, for State, county or municipal purposes. But this
              exemption from taxation by State authority, does not include either the issues or the
              stock of the National Banks. On the contrary, Congress has expressely enacted, and the
              Supreme Court of the United States has authoritatively decided, that the stock of
              these National Banks may be taxed, by State authority, in the hands of the individual
              owner of the stock, provided it is placed on an equality in this respect with the
              stocks of the banking institutions of the State, by whose authority the tax was
              levied. In other words, the State may tax the stock of the National Banks in the hands
              of the shareholders, but not at a greater rate, or to a greater extent, than they tax
              the stock of their own banking institutions. Not only has Congres so enacted, and the
              Supreme Court so decided, but in pursuance thereof, we do now tax National Bank stock
              in the the State, for State, County and Township purposes, under the act of 1867. But,
              by that act, it was, and is, exempted for municipal purposes; and this brings us to
              the real question at issue between the friends and adversaries of this bill.

            That question is, why is this stock taxed for State and county purposes, and exempted
              for city and towns, or municipal purposes? The exemption is not certainly based on
              reason, or sound policy. Banks are always located in towns or cities, and are as much
              protected by municipal government as other property, and no property can, in view of
              its productiveness, better afford to pay taxes than the stock of these banks.

            The only question remaining is, can it be legally taxed for municipal purposes? The
              opponents of the bill say it can not; we say it can.

            On what grounds is the opinion based that this stock may be taxed for State and
              county purposes, and may not be for municipal purposes? The answer is this, that the
              State can not tax stock in the National Banks at a greater rate, or to a greater
              extent, than she taxes the stock in her own banks. Now, the opponents of this bill say
              that we have the dead carcass of a once live bank in this State, to-wit: the Bank of
              the State of Indiana, and that the stock of this bank of the State of Indiana, and its
              branches, can not be taxed for municipal purposes because you have expressly exempted
              it from such taxation by its charter, and, it being exempted, the stock of the
              National Banks is also from taxation for municipal purposes; cause you cannot tax them
              for any purpose for which you do not tax your own banks.

            This brings us to the question, is the stock of the Bank of the State exempt from
              taxation for municipal purposes?

            And this question again, depends upon the other question; whether the clause of the
              15th section of the Charter of the Bank of the State of Indiana, which declares that
              the capital stock of said bank or branches shall not be taxable for municipal purposes
              is constitutional or not. If the exemption is constitutional, it being part of the
              charter has become a contract, and can not be altered, or repealed, without the
              consent of the Bank.

            This exemption was passed in the interest of capital, as against labor, by a
              Democratic Legislature; and its constitutionality was sustained by a Democratic
              Supreme Court, in the face of that provision of the Constitution which declares:
              "The General Assembly shall provide by law for a form and equal
              rate of assessment and taxation, and shall prescribe such regulations as shall secure
                a just valuation for taxation of all property, both real and
                personal excepting such only for municipal, educational, literary, scientific,
              religious or charitable purposes, as may be specially exempt by law."

            Now let it be remembered that this requires a just valuation of all property, both
              real and personal, not simply for State taxation, or for township taxation, but for
              taxation in general, without any qualification except such property only as may be
              used for municipal, educational, literary, scientific, religious or charitable
              purposes. Now bank stock is not within this exemption, and the old Democratic Supreme
              Court, to sustain the exemption of the stock of the bank of the State from municipal
              taxation, had to resort to the theory that this provision of the Constitution, refers
              only to State taxes, and not to taxes levied for county, township or municipal
              purposes. That Court assumed that the equality assessment and taxation required by the
              Constitution is an equality of per cent-or rate, in the levy, and from this false
              assumption, they, go on to say, "Taxes for corporation purposes can not be equal
              for Township and County purposes can be equal." Of course the necessities of one
              County, Township, or City, will differ from those of another, and hence, one rate per
              centum will be necessary here, and another there. But the Constitution, when it
              requires a uniform and equal rate of assessment
              and taxations, and a just valuation of all property, does not mean a
              uniformity in the per cent. levied, so that the percent. in one County for County
              purposes shall be the same as in another. But it does mean, as the present Supreme
              Court has decided (in 27th Ind. 230) that "the assessment and taxation must be
              uniform and equal throughout the locality in which the tax is
              levied." If the levy is for State purposes, the rate must be uniform and equal in
              all parts of the State, and if the levy is made, and so in the townships, towns and
              cities.

            It was simply intended, says the Supreme Court, that the uniformity and equality of
              rate should be co-extensive with the territory to which the tax applies.

            The absurdity of the opinion, that this uniformity and equality of assessment and
              taxation, required by the Constitution, only includes State taxes proper, is manifest,
              when we consider that the State taxes assessed do not amount to one-sixth part of the
              aggregate amount of the county, township, city and town taxes assessed every year. It
              is possible that the convention which framed the Constitution, should prohibit the
              Legislature from discriminating against one kind of property, or in favor of another,
              as to the two millions of State taxes assessed, and yet allow the
              General Assembly to levy twelve millions of taxes for local
              purposes, or on real estate alone, to the entire exemption of capital. Such is the
              result of the construction contended for by the opponents of this bill.

            Mr. ZOLLARS saw in the bill an issue, not a political issue, but an issue between
              capital and labor. The gentleman from Monroe (Mr. Buskirk) was correct as far as he
              went, but he did not reach the issue. We doubtless could not tax these shares as the
              law now stands, but we propose to change the law. He concurred with the gentleman from
              Spencer, that the provision to exempt the State bank shares from taxation for
              municipal purposes is unconstitutional. It was so decided by the Supreme Court in
              1866. He read from a late decision of the Supreme Court, to show that the rate of
              taxation shall be uniform and equal upon all property throughout the territory to
              which the tax applies; and also by way of reasoning against the constitutionality of
              the exemption in the 15th section of the charter of the Bank of the State of Indiana.
              He was also sustained by the recommendation of Governor Baker. So he rested this case,
              without controverting the special argument of the gentleman from Monroe, and proceeded
              to sustain the provisions of the bill proposing to tax the State Bank shares as well
              as those of the National Banks upon the principle of justice and equality, showing
              also how the Government is cheated in the assessment of the income tax of the banks;
              that where it should have received thirteen millions, throughout the country, it
              really collected but ten millions. He also gave a statement of figures showing the
              enormous profits realized under the National Banking laws - reading freely from
              statements and conclusions by the Hon. B. F. Butler, of Massachusetts, in a speech in
              the House of Representatives of the Fortieth Congress. And from these facts, he urged
              both the legality and the equity of the provisions of the bill. It was the old issue
              between labor and capital - he was on the side of labor.

            Mr. NEFF spoke of the origin of the bill, the consideration to which it is entitled,
              and the opposition it has received. He was glad that it involves no political
              question. And he read the recommendation of Governor Baker in his biennial message for
              such legislation as will enable the State to tax the shares of stock in the banks for
              municipal purposes, like other property. He alleged with earnesttness the sheer
              justice and equity of the bill.

            Mr. BUSKIRK asked whether this opinion of the Governor in this case is worth any more
              than that of the legal opinion of any other respectable lawyer?

            Mr. NEFF. In ordinary cases it is not. But when it becomes the opinion of the
              Executive of the State, addressed to the Legislature, he was obliged to regard it as
              worth more. He pursued the reading from the message, and concluded with an expression
              of the readiness and earnestness with which he would support the bill with his
              vote.

            Mr. WILLSON followed the line of argument submitted by Mr. Kercheval - reading the
              constitutional provision for taxation, and the direct conflict therewith in the 15th
              section of the Charter of the Bank of the State. He would sustain and redeem every
              pledge which the national government has made, but he would go no further in the
              interest of capital. He would not tax the United States bonds, because the government
              was pledged against that; but there was no pledge forfeited in taxing shares in bank
              stock.

            Mr. VATER answered the argument, that we have no right to tax bank shares, because a
              large percent. of them may be owned by those who do not live in the city. Just as
              reasonably might it be said that we should not tax town lots which are owned by
              non-residents. All he asked was that the authorities shall not discriminate against
              the laboring man in the matter of taxation. He quoted the constituitional provision against the granting of exclusive
              privileges. How would it look for him to come in here with a bill to exempt all
              bricklayers from taxation for municipal purposes? He referred to the issue here
              between labor and capital, suggested by Mr. Zollars. It was that which (sometimes
              unwisely) suggested those combinations of workingmen all over the country, because it
              was observable that capitalists and moneyed men manipulated the legislation of the
              country too much in their own interest, and he would have gentlemen to beware how, in
              forgetfulness of this issue, they allow themselves to vote against this bill.

            Mr. JOHNSON, of Parke, spoke in reply to Mr. Neff. The Governor's recommendation
              was not an argument, and some gentlemen here, now gladly availing themselves of his
              opinions, but one year ago would not have quoted him as authority. He referred to the
              law of Congress, and the charter of the State Bank, to show ther incompatibility with
              this bill-and plead the chartered exemption from municipal taxation as a solemn
              contract which cannot be revoked but by the consent of the contracting parties. By way
              of offset to the decision quoted from 27th Indiana Reports, he referred to a decision
              of the same Court, establishing the doctrine, that the legislative power to create a
              bank implies also the power to exempt from municipal taxation. He then proceeded to
              show at length the fact of the direct Government bank tax of four and a half per cent,
              for the privilege of banking; and, if the argument of the friends of the bill be good,
              just so far as we may oppress them with taxation, just so far will those have to pay
              for it who borrow money over their counters. He paid a tribute to the excellence of
              our national banking system, giving uniformity of exchange arid security to the note
              holders. When he hrd concluded-

            Mr. WILDMAN demanded the previous question, and there was a second, and the main
              question, viz: Shall the bill pass? was ordered-the vote thereon resulting-yeas 55,
              nays 29-as follows:

            
              
                
                   YEAS-Messrs. Admire, Barritt, Bates, Beeler, Bobo, Britton,

            Mr. BRECKINRIDGE, explaining. My sympathies are all in favor of the bill feel that we
              ought to tax these bondholders all we can. But still, it seems to me that this would
              be a violation of contract the law of Congress in the case.

            Mr. DAVIS, of Floyd's, explanation was not well heard. He voted aye, under the
              decision of the Supreme Court cited in the debate from the XVIIth Indiana Reports.

            Mr. PIERCE, of Vigo, explained. Looking into the charter of the Bank of the State, he
              found a section which provides how these State banks may be taxed and for what
              purpose. And further along subsequently in this charter there is a provision that it
              shall not be changed without the consent of the President and Directors of these banks
              And he found that, in the Eleventh Indian! Reports, it is decided that cities can not
              tax these banks, because the charter creating these banks has limited the power of the
              State in that direction. And he was therefore, obliged to think that the State has no
              power to authorize their taxation by the cities without the consent of the Directors
              of the banks.

            Mr. STANTON had felt that the object of the bill is correct and right, but he yielded
              to the same considerations that controlled the vote of the gentleman from Vigo.

            Mr. STEWART, of Rush. My sympathies and views of right and justice are decidedly and
              fully in favor of the bill. I think it would be just and right. But seeing that the
              authorities are in direct opposition to the bill, I therefore vote "no."

            So the bill passed the House of Representatives.

            Mr. McDONALD filed his motion to reconsider the vote rejecting the female Prison bill
                (H. R. 176).

            The House then adjourned.

          
          
          
          
        
        

        
          IN SENATE.

          
             FRIDAY, April 30, 1869.
          

          The Senate met at 9 o'clock A. M.-President pro
              tem. J. R. CRAVENS in the chair.

          On motion by Mr. ROBINSON, of Decatur, the reading of the Secretary's minutes of
            yesterday was dispensed with. 

          
            SENATE BILLS ON THE FINAL READING.

             The Senate proceeded to the consideration of Senate bills on the third reading that
              being the order at the adjournment yesterday. 

            Mr. Reynold's bill [S. 177] to prohibit Clerks of Courts from taking
              declarations  of aliens of intention to become
              citizens, &c., was read for the third time and failed to pass for want of a
              constitutional majority - yeas 21, nays 16.

            Mr. Robinson of Madison's bill [S. 181] to amend section 343 of the General
              Practice act, was read the third time. 

            Mr. R explained that the bill provides that for good cause shown the court may grant
              time till the end of the suceeding term to amend bills and exceptions.

            The bill passed by yeas 34, nays 0.

            Mr. Craven's bill [S. 184] to amend the 19th section of the Felony act, approved
              June 10, 1852, was read the third time and passed the Senate by yeas 34, nays 1.

            Mr. Craven's bill [S. 187] to amend the act of June, 18 1852, in relation to the
              taxation of lands in towns and cities, was read the third time.

            Mr. LASALLE explained that it guards small farmers in cities against oppressive city
              taxes. It exempts forty acres or more from taxation when used wholly for agricultural
              purposes, and where it lies within the corporation limits.

            Mr. JAQUESS objected to the bill on ground that it would exempt some $300,000 of
              property now paying taxes in the city of Evansville.

            Mr. MORGAN stated that certain heirs held a large tract of land in Evansville needed
              for the enlargement of the city, and as they are receiving the benefits incident to
              the improvement of the city, they should pay city taxes.

            Mr. ANDREWS spoke of other serious objections to the bill.

            Mr. WOLCOTT regarded this as a bill to protect large speculators instead of small
              farmers.

            Mr. LASALLE insisted that the bill would prevent an oppression by city taxation that
              should not be justified, and that it was our duty to pass this bill.

            Mr. CARSON objected to this class of exemptions-it operates unjustly upon mechanics
              and laboring men.

            Mr. CRAVENS said the bill was presented to him by some gentleman, with a request to
              introduce it. He supposed it to be an amendment to the general law for the government
              of cities; and it struck him as being eminently proper. If a man owns forty acres or
              more near the city limits, used wholly for agricultural purposes, it should not be
              dragged into the corporation and made to pay exhorbitant taxes, without the owners
              consent. If there was anything wrong; in the bill he could not see it.

            Mr. CHURCH stated considerations which influenced his opposition to this measure. The
              law of 1867 taxes five acres m the city limits, while this bill proposes to exempt
              forty acres or more.

            Mr. HOWK considered the bill out of order, because it proposes to revise and amend a
              law that is dead.

            Mr. WOLCOTT desired, but failed to obtain unanimous consent for the introduction of
              an amendment that any person whose wealth consists of unimproved land in incorported
              limits, if the same amount to 40 acres, it shall be exempt from municipal
              taxation.

            Mr. HOWK demanded the previous question, and under its operations The bill was
              rejected by yeas 7, nays 32.

            The House message granting a Committee of Conference on the Court
              bill [H. R. 90] was taken up, and the
              President, pro tem., [Mr. Robinson, of Madison, in-the chair]
              appointed Messrs. Cravens, Morgan and Bellamy, the Committee on the part of the
              Senate.

            Mr. Scott's bill [S. 188] providing for the sale of certain lands in the County
              of Clay was read-it having failed to pass for want of a Constitutional majority day
              before yesterday.

            Mr. JOHNSTON, of Montgomery, thought there must be something covered up in this bill.
              There is a strong probability that the county seat may be moved near to this land;
              which would greatly increase its value. He should vote against the bill.

            Mr. SCOTT and Mr. GRAY were of opinion that the land is worth more now than it will
              be just after the location, should it be made.

            Mr. HANNA declared the title to this tract imperfect. Being a coal bed arid near
              furnaces, it will bring a good price. The State would realize as much by a sale now,
              in his judgment, as it will at any time.

            Mr. JOHNSON, of Spencer, said there is a bill in the other House to restore this land
              to the widow of the former owner, but believing that the State owns the land, and that
              a sale would kill the bill referred to, he favored the passage of this measure.

            The bill passed by yeas 26, nays 10. 

          
          

          
            DISCIPLINE OF PRISONS.

             The President pro tem announced the special order-being Mr.
              Kinley's bill [S. 120] for the reorganization and government of the State
              Prisons, and repealing all conflicting laws, on the second reading,

            Mr. ROBINSON, of Decatur, moved to strike from the bill the first section.

            Mr. KINLEY said the changes in the bill were on the side of economy, humanity and
              moral reform, and therefore challenged careful consideration by the Senate. The fact
              that 800 able bodied men, furnished with coarse and simple food and shops to work in,
              are not self-supporting, is a sufficient argument against OUT present State Prison
              system. He urged the passage of  this bill; and,
              desiring that it may be made as perfect as possible, suggested that it be read by
              sections for the purpose of amendment before being put upon its final reading in the
              Senate.

            Mr. JOHNSTON of Montgomery, regarded the pay of Directors, as proposed in the bill,
              as entirely too small; or, if it is not, then the compensation now paid is too large.
              He referred to inconsistencies, as he viewed them, in Mr. Kinley's remarks, and
              indicated his opposition to the bill.

            Mr. BRADLEY would support the bill with an amendment to the 16th section, striking
              out the provision that the term of a recaptured convict shall be increased by the
              judgment of the Board of Commissioners, and inserting in lieu a provision that the
              convict shall be required to serve for such further time in addition to his original
              term as the court or jury trying the case shall determine.

            Then came a recess for dinner. 

          
          

          
            AFTERNOON SESSION.

             PRESIDENT, pro tem., Cravens resumed the chair at 2 o'clock
              p. M. 

          

          
            FEES OF COUNTY OFFICERS.

             On motion by Mr. MORGAN the bill [H. R. 78] to amend the act of March 2, 1855, to
              regulate the fees of officers, concerning fees of clerks of courts and other county
              officers, was read the first time.

            On motion by Mr. ROBINSON, of Madison, the constitutional restriction was dispensed
              with, the bill was read the second time by title only and referred to the
                Committee on Fees and Salaries.

            Mr. CARSON desired instructions to go with the bill that when the fees exceed $4,000
              the surplus shall go into the County Treasury.

            Mr. KINLEY moved to amend the instructions by providing that one-half above $2,000
              shall be paid into the county treasury.

            Mr. HADLEY suggested the difficulty of paying the salaries of half a dozen clerks out
              of those sums. In such cases the margin left for the county officer would be very
              small.

            The amendment was rejected.

            Mr. CARSON modified his motion for instructions so as to make it a motion of inquiry
              as to the expediency of inserting a section to allow county officers not to exceed
              $3,000, exclusive of clerk hire.

            The instructions as modified were agreed to. 

          
          

          
            GOVERNOR'S MANSION.

             Mr. MONTGOMERY, from the Select Committee on a Gubernatorial Mansion, reported
              favorably to the purchase of the Hasselman property for an Executive residence, on the
              corner of Meridian and Vermont streets, for $70,000, and submitted a bill to provide
              for said purchase, which was read for information.

            Mr. JOHNSTON, of Montgomery, presented a proposition to duplicate Mr.
              Hasselman's residence, on the Blind Asylum grounds, for $42,500. Also, a
              proposition to duplicate the Walpole property, On the same grounds, for $23,000; both
              signed by J. H. Baldwin, Franklin Landers and A. Rapert.

            The report and propositions were laid on the table. 

          
          

          
            DISCIPLINE OF PRISONS.

             The Senate returned to the consideration of the Prison bill [S. 120], pending at the
              noon recess-the question being on the motion to strike out the first section of the
              bill after the enacting clause.

            The motion was agreed to by yes is 29 nays 9.

            Mr. BRADLEY now offered his amendment printed above; and an additional section
              repealing all inconsistent laws.

            These amendments were agreed to.

            Mr. CARSON moved to amend section 9 by striking out the clause prohibiting the use of
              intoxicating liquors and profane language by employes; but contented himself with
              inserting in said section the word "habitual," before the word
              "use," which amendment was agreed to.

            Mr. GRAY moved to amend by providing that convict labor shall not be hired for less
              than sixty-five cents per day for each convict. Ohio has adopt ed this plan of
              limiting the price for convict labor; and last year a revenue was yielded of eighty
              thousand dollars where heretofore the prison has been; burden to the State. He
              contended that unless this amendment were adopted the bill would not amount to
              much.

            Mr. ANDREWS spoke in favor of th amendment. Indiana can certainly contract her
              convict labor as high as they can in Ohio.

            Mr. FISHER suggested a difficulty that might follow this amendment. Suppose no one
              will bid 65 cents? Then the convicts will lie idle; and it were better to contract
              their labor for 25 cents a day, or less, than that state of things should occur. 

            Mr. BRADLEY thought it not good policy to adopt this amendment, because we do not
              know that this convict labor will always bring that price, and, as was announced D.
              the Senator from Wabash, (Mr. Fisher), was better to get only 25 cents a day that for
              the convicts to lie idle. 

            Mr. GIFFORD understood there were some 200 convicts in the Ohio penitentiary that
              could not be hired for the sum fixed by the Legislature of that State; and this  was one reason why the Prison
                Committee refused to put in the bill a clause of this kind.

            Mr. GRAY said there was a combination in Ohio among those who hire convict labor, for
              the purpose of influencing the Ohio Legislature now in session on this subject, and
              that is the reason why there are some 200 now unemployed in the Ohio prison.

            Mr. SMITH opposed the amendment, contending that monopolies would override any price
              the Legislature may set upon convict labor.

            Mr. JAQUESS also opposed the amendment. Some of our prison convict labor contracts
              run two years yet, and a financial convulsion within that time may reduce the price of
              wages. Then he thought sixty-five cents too high at any rate.

            The amendment was rejected by yeas 17, nays 20.

            Mr. HANNA moved to amend section 19 by providing that not more than eight hours shall
              be exacted from the convicts for a day's work.

            Mr. FISHER opposed limiting felons to eight hours work, while the rest of mankind are
              not also limited to that time.

            Mr. MORGAN favored the bill as it now stands.

            Mr. GIFFORD thought the amendment would but reduce the price of labor.

            Mr. HANNA offered the amendment to see if the Senate will legislate in favor of labor
              or in favor of contractors. He doubted the policy of hiring out our convict labor to
              contractors; and no bill authorizing it could get his vote. He wanted humanity to have
              a liberal share of the legislation in this country.

            Mr. KINLEY as a rule was an eight hour man, but since men outside of prisions have to
              work ten hours, he thought those inside should do the same. He moved to amend by
              making it ten hours,The amendment was agreed to.

            The amendment as amended was also agreed to.

            Mr. JOHNSON, of Montgomery, moved to strike from the llth section the
              words"coarse and" before the words "wholesome food," and the word
              "adult" before the word "person."The amendment was agreed to. 

            Mr. HANNA said the bill was very unsatisfactory to him, but notwithstanding that, he
              should vote for it.

            The bill was passed by yeas 29, nays 8.

            The PRESIDENT pro tem laid before the senate a message from the
              Governor transmitting a proposition from the Commissioners of Marion county to donate
              a addition to the sum of $100,000 heretofore offered by them, provided the
              Agricultural College be located in Marion county.

            It was referred to the Committee on Agricultural College.

            On motion by Mr. FISHER the bill [H. R. 388],
              to authorize the President of the State Board of Agriculture to fill vacancies in the
              offices of that Board till a regular meeting of the Board, was passed to the final
              reading and passed by yeas 38, nays 0.

            Mr. CARSON offered a resolution that when the Senate adjourn it be till Monday at 2
              o'clock P. M.

            The resolution was rejected by yeas and nays. 

          
          

          
            AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE.

             Mr. STEIN, from the Committee on Agricultural College,
              recommended the passage of a substitute for the Agricultural College bill [S. 156] accepting the donations offered by the
              citizens and the county of Tippecanoe, and locating the Agricultural College in said
              county.

            Mr. CAVIN moved to refer the report and bill back to the committee, for the reason
              than another offer by the Commissioners of Marion county, of $75,000, had but a few
              moments since been sent in here by the Governor which should be considered by the
              committee. The money value of the inducements and donations offered by Marion county
              may be summed up thus: The buildings and grounds of the Northwestern Christian
              University, $175,000; the endowment of that institution, $110,000; the Marion county
              cash donation, $175,000; the twenty-seven acres adjoining the Northwestern Christian
              University, tendered by, the Fletcher heirs, $61,000; making a total of $521,000.

            Mr. STEIN opposed the motion. The session is drawing rapidly to a close, and it-is
              very desirable that action should be had on this question during this present session.
              He reviewed the offers and inducements presented before the Committee and insisted
              that there should be no more delay in this matter.

            Mr. TAGGART offered a resolution that when the Senate adjourn it adjourn till Monday
              at 10 o'clock A. M.

            It was rejected by a tie vote-yeas 20, nays 20.

            Mr. CARSON moved to lay on the table the motion to refer back the Agricultural
              College bill to the committee making the report thereon.

            The motion was agreed to by yeas 23, nays 15.

            Mr. HANNA offered a resolution, which was adopted, that this subject be made the
              special order for Tuesday at 10 o'clock, and' that 100 copies of the bill
              and an abstract,  of the propositions from Marion
              and Tippacanoe counties be printed. 

          
          

          
            RECESS TILL MONDAY.

             On motion of Mr. FISHER the vote of the Senate refusing to adopt the resolution,
              adjourning from this afternoon till Monday at two o'clock, was reconsidered.

            The resolution was then adopted. 

          
          

          
            RAILRORD LINES.

            On motion by Mr. HANNA the bill [H. R. 322] authorizing railroad companies to connect
              their lines, &c., was read the second time, with Committee amendments, which were
              adopted.

            On his further motion the Constitutional restriction was dispensed with, the bill
              again read, and passed the Senate by yeas 30, nays 8. 

          
          

          
            MUNICIPAL BANK SHARES TAX.

            On motion by Mr. MORGAN the bill [H. R. 170] a bill to provide for the collection and
              assessment of taxes on shares of bank stools, was read the first time.

            Mr. SHERROD moved to lay the bill on the table, and that 100 copies be printed it
              being an important bill and deserving careful consideration.

            The motion was agreed to.

            And then the Senate adjourned till Monday at 2 o'clock P. M.
            

          
          
          
          
        
        

        
          HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.

          Mr. McBRIDE obtained leave to introduce a joint resolution [H. R. No. 16] concerning
            the Southern Prison. [For the removal of Director F. M. Meredith.]

          Mr. PIERCE, of Vigo, moved that it be laid on the table for the present, (to await the
            consideration of the report of the prison Committee) -affirmative,
            32, negative 32-no quorum. Subsequently the motion was agreed to-yeas 44, nays 36.

          The SPEAKER laid before the House, reports from the Columbus, Chicago and Indiana
            Central Railroad Company, with reference to the transportation of Soldiers, etc., which
            were referred to the special Railroad Committee.

          Also a communication from the Governor, transmitting the proposal of Jesse Mehary to
            donate 320 acres of his farm (Shawnee Mound) for the use of the Agricultural College,
            conditioned that said college be located thereon, etc., which was referred to the
            special Committee on the Agricultural College.

          On motion of Mr. FULLER, the railroad bill [S.
              215] to authorize counties and towns to take stock in railroads was taken up,
            and passed the first reading.

          Mr. FULLER moved that it be referred to the Judiciary Committee,
            but, on the request of Mr. WELBORN, it went to the files.

          On motion of Mr. RUDDELL, the Senate amendments to Mr. Stewart of Rush's bill
              [H. R. 132], to enable cities to subscribe
            stock to aid in the construction of railroad and water power, subject to the restriction
            of the act of March 14, 1867, were taken up and concurred in.

          
            THE MORGAN RAID BILL.

             Mr. DAVIS of Floyd submitted a motion-to relieve the Committee on Ways and
                Means from the consideration of Hutchings' Morgan Raid Appropriation
              bill [H. R. 119] to enable him to make a motion to refer it to a select committee.

            Mr. OSBORN and Mr. STEWART of Rush opposed the motion as discourteous toward the
              standing committee.

            Mr. DAVIS. Not at all; and, answering objections, he still insisted on his motion.
              The same course had been taken with other bills.

            Mr. STANTON objected not to the bill going to a Special Committee, though the
                Ways and Means Committee might be ready to report soon.

            Mr. Davis' motion prevailed, and the bill was referred to a special committee of
              one from each Congressional District.

            Mr. RATLIFF entered his motion to reconsider the action of the House for the location
              of the Agricultural College. 

          
          

          
            THE CALENDAR.

            Mr. WILDMAN moved a suspension of the order of business, and to take up the
              consideration of bills of the House on the third reading.

            Mr. DUNN (in order to hear the minority report from the Judiciary
                Committee promised yesterday) moved ineffectually to lay Mr.
              Wildman's motion on the table-yeas 16, nays 61; and then Mr. Wildman's
              motion was agreed to.

            Mr. Pierce of Vigo's dog bill [H. R. 211] penalty for allowing dogs to run at
              large in the night time, $5 to $50was read the third time.

            On motion of Mr. CORY it was indefinitely postponed-affirmative 42, negative 26.

            Mr. PIERCE of Vigo, moved to reconsider this vote.

            Mr. CORY moved to lay that motion on the table, which was ruled out of order, because
              it is not in order to consider the motion of Mr. Pierce without a suspension of the
              order just taken to consider bills in the calendar.

            Mr. Gilham's Valuation Law Amendment bill [H.
                R. 158], adding to the 23d section of the act of June 21, 1852, these words.
              "Provided, that if any such person shall 
              converted moneys, credits or other personal property, in the year preceding the first
              of January of the current year, into bonds or other securities of the United States,
              and shall hold or control said bonds or other securities when he is required to list
              his property, he shall list the monthly average value of such moneys, credits or other
              property thus converted while such moneys, credits or other property were held or
              controlled by him; and provided further, that nay indebtedness of such person or
              persons, represented by him, created by investment in said bonds or other securities,
              shall not be deducted from the amount of credits in making up his list for
              taxation."

            Mr. GILHAM explained the object and effect of the bill-a man to give in the average
              amount of moneys held by him during the year. It was copied from the Ohio law.

            Mr. SHOAFF raised an objection, which was answered by Mr. GILHAM.

            Mr. McFADIN spoke distinctly for the passage of the bill.

            Mr. GORDON stated the objection, that it would require tax payers to keep books.

            The bill finally passed the House of Representatives-yeas 69, nays 12.

            Mr. Welborn's bill [H. R. 95] for the
              relief of John Ingle and John Ingle, Jr.-(to quiet their title to their 200 acre farm,
              defective on account of alienage)-was taken up.

            Mr. WELBORN explained the provisons and the single object of the bill-an act of
              justice to the Ingles.

            The bill finally passed the House; yeas 77, nays 0.

            Mr. Palmer's bill (H. R. 104) to amend section 379 of the Practice act of 1852,
              was taken up and read the third time.

            It proposes to substitute for the last clause of said section these words: "Or
              unless the plaintiff shall plead and prove a mortgage or other lein on real estate of
              the defendant by which the debt is secured, in which case the party recovering
              judgment shall recover costs,"

            Mr. PALMER stated the effect of the bill: and it was finally passed the House-yeas
              77, nays 0.

            Mr. Coffroth's bill [H. R. 186] providing proceedings supplementary to
              executions in courts of Justices of the Peace, etc-, was read the third time.

            It provides that when the execution is returned unsatisfied, the judgment creditor
              shall be entitled to an order requiring the the judgement debtor to appear before the
              Justice to answer under oath concerning his property within the county, &c.,
              &c. Both parties to testify on trials in such cases, &c.

            Mr. COFFROTH tated that the effect of the bill is to give the same power to Justices
              Courts that now exists in the courts of record, to enforce the collection of
              judgments. The jurisdictions of Justices of the Peace become of some importance, since
              in certain cases they may be extended to two or three hundred dollars.

            The bill was finally passed the House of Representatives-yeas 77, nays 0.

          
          

          
            STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE.

             Mr. WILLIAMS, of Knox, obtained leave to introduce a bill [H. R. 388] for an act to authorize the President
              of the State Board of Agriculture to fill vacancies in the office of Secretary, in the
              office of Treasurer, and in the office of Superintendent of the State Board of
              Agriculture; which was read; and he then moved a suspension of the constitutional
              restriction to admit of its passage at once, referring to the emergency on account of
              the decease of the late Secretary of the Board, Hon., A. J. Holmes.

            Mr. DUNN proposed and obtained leave to introduce a bill [H. R. 389] to authorize a
              committee to remodel the judicial system, which he moved to include in the proposed
              suspension of the constitutional restriction.

            Mr. FIELD, of Lake, moved to include his Donovan relief bill [H. R. 294.]

            Mr. COFFROTH moved to include the Senate Court bill No. 338.

            Mr. WILLIAMS accepted these amendments to his motion; and the constitutional
              restriction being removed accordingly-his Agricultural Board bill [H. R. 388] was passed the second and final
              readings-yeas 76, nays 0. 

          
          

          
            THE COURT SYSTEM.

             Mr. DUNN then introduced, his bill [H. R. 389], to authorize the Governor to appoint
              three Commissioners to revise, amend and remodel the system of courts of this State;
              fixing the time when this commission shall meet (120 days); giving them a certain
              compensation ($5 a day); giving them certain privileges, and declaring an emergency,
              and it was read the first and second time.

            Mr. WILLSON moved ineffectually to make the commission five instead of three.

            Mr. DAVIS, of Floyd, suggested, that we can't get commissioners, such as we
              ought to have, for $5 a day.

            Mr. STANTON proposed $10.

            Mr. DAVIS preferred that the House would make it $6, by general consent. He spoke to
              the propriety of increasing this compensation, submitting general considerations in
              favor of the bill.

            The vote on Mr. Davis's amendment being-affirmative 35, negative 30discovered no
              quorum; and then-

            

            On motion of Mr. DUNN, the bill was referred to the Committee on the
                Judiciary.

            Mr. PIERCE, of Porter (by leave) submitted a formal order, that when the House shall
              adjourn this (Friday) evening it shall be till Tuesday morning at 9 o'clock.

            Mr. RUDDELL proposed till Monday, 2 o'clock.

            Mr. LONG moved ineffectually to lay the matter on the table.

            Mr. Ruddell's amendment was then agreed to, and the question recurred on the
              adoption of the order, as amended, which was also agreed to-yeas 51, nays 22.The House
              then took a recess till 2 o'clock. 

          
          

          
            AFTERNOON SESSION.

             Mr. HAMILTON asked and obtained leave to submit the following:

            Resolved, That the adult employes of the State Librarian, during
              the regular session of 1869, be allowed $5 a day.

            Mr. H. stated his belief that there were seven of them, who received but $3 a day-no
              more than the pages.

            Mr. CORY. Disabled soldiers-some of them.

            Mr. GORDON opposed the resolution, as an extravagance.

            Mr. WELBORN demanded the previous question, and under its operation (Messrs. Davidson
              and Cory demanding the yeas and nays) the proposition was rejected.- Yeas, 6; nays,
              61. 

          

          
            MORGAN RAID BILL.

              Bowen, Stanton, Johnston of Parke. Gordon, McFadin, Bobo7 Coffroth, and Pierce of
              Porter-one member from each Congressional District.

            Mr. McDONALD submitted the following:

            Resolved, That one Floor Page is all that is necessary to do the
              business required by the House; therefore, it is hereby declared that but one Page
              shall be employed for the balance of the session.

            Objections being made, the resolution could not be entertained. 

          
          

          
            THE LIQUOR LAW BILLS.

             On motion of Mr. COFFROTH, the consideration of the several bills set for the

              was postponed till Wednesday. 

          
          

          
            HEIRS OF PATRICK DONOVAN, DECEASED.

             Mr. Field of Lake's bill [H. R. 294] for
              relief of the heirs at law of Patrick Donovan, deceased, was taken up in the order of
              unfinished business, and read the third time.

            It provides that said alien heirs may sell their 160 acres of land in the county Of
              Lake-the provisions being explained by Mr. Field-the bill passed the final reading in
              the House of Representatives-yeas 67 nays 2. 

          
          

          
            TENTH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT.

             The bill [S. 338] defining what counties (Huntington, Whitley, Wells, Adams and
              Alien) shall constitute the Tenth Judicial Circuit, and fixing the time of holding
              courts therein, was taken up as unfinished business of this morning, read twice by
              title and the third time by sections.

            On explanation by Mr. COFFROTH, it was finally passed the House-yeas 69, nays 0.

            Mr. RUDDELL moved ineffectually to take up the gravel road bill No. 52. 

            Mr. PIERCE, of Porter, moved that the House take up the consideration of the Senate
              bills No. 83 and 84; which- 

            On the motion of Mr. ZOLLARS, was amended so as to include the consideration of
              Senate bills generally; and so the order was adopted.

            The bill [S. 83] to amend section 2 of the act
              declaring the registry of sales of Michigan road lands and certified copies thereof
              evidence, and declaring the effect thereof, approved March 9, 1859, was taken up, read
              the second and third times, and finally passed the House of Representatives-yeas 68,
              nays 0.

            On the motion of Mr. STANTON (the Constitutional restriction having been removed for
              the purpose-yeas 67, nays 3)-it was ordered that the remainder of the bills from the
              Senate on the second reading, now in the calendar of the House, be considered on the
              second and third readings thereof.

            The bill [S. 84] to repeal section 31 of the
              act concerning real property and the alienation thereof, approved May 6, 1862, was
              take up and read the second time.

            After some conversation across the House, from which it appeared that there-peal of
              this 31st section complements the provisions of the bill [S. 84]-the bill was finally passed the House of
              Representativesyeas 66, nays 3.

            The bill [S. 134] to authorize and encourage
              the construction of levees, dykes and drains, and the reclamation, of wet and
              overflowed lands by incorporated companies; and repealing all laws on the same
              subject, was taken up and read the first time by title and the second time by
              sections.

            Mr. LONG moved that it be referred to the Committee on Swamp
              Lands.

            Mr. COFFROTH proposed to amend by striking out the 17th (the repealing) section to avoid the repeal of the existing ditch
              law.

            Mr. WILLIAMS, of Knox, proposed that it be referred to the Committee on the
                Judiciary.

            Mr. Long accepted it as his motion; and the bill was referred accordingly.

            The bill [S. 211] defining the counties-constituting the Eighth Judicial
              Circuit,etc., was taken up, read the second time,and passed over.

            The bill [S. 110] with reference to the State
              University lands, etc., was read the second time. 

          
          

          
            AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE.

             The SPEAKER laid before the House a communication from the Governor, transmitting a
              proposition from the Commissioners of Marion county, Indiana, to add $15,000 to the
              $100,000 heretofore offered by them for the use of the Agricultural College, provided
              said college be located in said county.

            On motion of Mr. STANTON, the motion and proposition were referred to the special
                Committee on the Agricultural College.

            On motion of Mr. ZOLLARS, the Savings Bank bill, No. 52, was made the special order
              for Tuesday morning.

            Mr. GORDON moved to make the Court bill [S. 211]-to constitute the Eighth Judicial
              Circuit, the special order for Tuesday, 2 o'clock.

            The SPEAKER (Mr. Stanton in the Chair) said this Senate bill, No. 211. affects the
              counties of Boone, Clinton, Parke, Montgomery, Fountain and Warren.

            Mr. COFFROTH said the gentleman from Fountain (Mr. Cunningham), and the gentleman
              from Clinton (Mr. Palmer), and he believed the gentleman from Montgomery (Mr.
              Johnston), have expressed some opposition to this bill; and some of these gentlemen
              having leaves of absence beyond Tuesday, he preferred (and it was but justice to
              them,) to defer the consideration of the bill till Wednesday or Thursday.

            Mr. GORDON said, the bill proposes to constitute the 8th Circuit as it stood two
              years ago.

            After further conversation, Mr. Gordon's motion was adopted, by yeas 50, nays
              17.

            On motion of Mr. RUDDELL, Mr. Millions Gravel Road bill, [H. R. 52,] was made the special order for
              Tuesday.

            On motion of Mr. COFFROTH, the Swamp Land bill, [S. 72,] was made the special order
              for Wednesday.

            On motion of Mr. BOBO, the county railroad bill, [S.
                215,] was made the special order for Wednesday morning, at l0
              o'clock.

            Mr. RUDDELL submitted the following:

            Resolved, (The Senate concuring,) That the Section 7 of the Statute
              shall cause to be distributed to the several counties of the State 10,000 copies of
              the Road Laws in pamphlet form, for the use of supervisors.

            But objections being made-

            On motion of Mr. CHITTENDEN, the House adjourned till Monday at two o'clock P. M.
            

          
          

          
            REMARKS OF HON. M. A. OSBORN, Representative for the
              Counties of Hendricks and Putnam,

            Delivered April 27, 1869, in the House of Representatives of the Forty-Sixth General
              Assembly of the State of Indiana, pending the consideration of Mr. Dunn's bill
              [H. R. 347] for "an act to establish an Indiana Agricultural College in
              connection with the State University, and providing for its organization and
              government.

            Mr. OSBORN proposed to amend, by striking out the words
              "Bloomington," "Monroe county," and "State University,"
              wherever they occur in the bill. He said:

            Mr. Speaker: This question is one that I am hardly prepared to meet just now, as I am
              not here with a written speech nor with prepared notes to enable me to present my
              ideas about this institution and the proper distribution of its funds with as much
              accuracy as those who have preceded me. But I shall try to present a few facts and
              arguments, in my feeble way, arid endeavor to make members of the House understand my
              ideas concerning the location of this Institution.

            There is one thing that is calculated to embarrass me as a member of this House in
              the discussion of the merits of this bill, and that is, that it is a proposition
              coming from one of our special committees. I dislike always to stand in the position
              of disagreeing with the report of a committee1", the members of which, I have no
              doubt, have discharged their duties in the best mariner they could. I say I dislike
              this. But, sir, there are some things connected with this matter which will afford me
              an excuse for the course which I shall take. And I shall mention them in a plain way.
              And I trust that no member of the Committee will take offense, because I have the
              utmost confidence in them as gentlemen. This Committee was raised but a few days
              ago-about the time this bill was referred to them. The Committee has met, and acted
              upon it, and made its report. And I for one, who having taken great interest in the
              location of this College, have to complain, because no member of this Committee has
              notified me at any time of its sittings or its action upon this bill. And I represent
              a county having a deep interest in the location of the Agricultural College, and which
              has been and is now competing for its location. Therefore I shall now address myself
              to the House, and try to set forth their claims in this matter as well as I may be
              able to do. The complaint I have to make is this, that this matter was considered in
              committee without any notice to me or any  other
              member representing and having an interest in this matter of the location of the
              Agricultural College in Putnam county. And I have been informed that the interests of
              Putnam county were not considered by the committee. It would have been but a matter of
              courtesy, since that county has offered $100,000 for the location-it would have been
              but proper that her members should have had notice of the sessions of the
              committee.

            Mr. WELBORN (interposing). As a member of the committee, I did not
              know that Putnam county had proposed a donation.

            Mr. OSRORN. That is precisely what I complain of: that the
              committee knew nothing about the proposition, notwithstanding my colleague, [Mr. Neff]
              made a very long speech for that locality. Therefore I am obliged to say that the
              committee have acted hastily in the matter.

            Mr. SHOAFF, (interposing.) The proposition of Putnam county was
              not before the Committee. If it had been, of course, it would have given the Committee
              pleasure to have given its Representatives notice.

            Mr. OSBORN. I had no notice of the action of the Committee until I
              heard the reading of their report here in the House.

            Mr. RATLIFF, (interposing.) The Committee had but two bills
              referred to it; and they considered only these new propositions, because it is a new
              Committee raised this session-entirely different from the committee of last
              session-and they did not consider it their duty to go back. We considered it our duty
              simply to report these bills back to the House, expecting the House to do with them as
              they please.

            Mr. OSBORN (resuming). I am very glad,sir, that the Chairman of
              the Committee has explained. He informs us that they considered that no other
              proposition was referred to them except the Purdue proposition and that from Monroe
              county. But, sir, Hancock county, Tippecanoe county and Marion county made liberal
              offers, and my own county of Putnam has made a liberal offer; and yet this committee
              goes out and considers none of these. Then, sir, the fact that they have rejected our
              county is my apology (if it were asked of me) for opposing this report. This is a
              matter that affects every member on this floor-every citizen of the State of Indiana.
              And when a member or a committee undertakes to consider a question of such magnitude
              as this, it should certainly entertain the propositions of all the parties competing,
              instead of making a report in such great haste. When I say to the committee the fact
              that you have not considered these propositions is my apology for opposing your
              report; and it shall be one of the reason that I shall urge why the report should not
              be concurred in.

            Mr. BUSKIRK [Mr. Welborn in the Chair.] Was not the gentleman
              aware that the committee had been appointed?

            Mr. OSBORN. I knew of the motion which was made for its
              appointment, but did not know who had been appointed. But I am not criticising the
              appointment nor the manner of the making up of the committee. The objection is, that
              they have reported hastily-for the purpose of hurrying business. And this is a matter
              which I conceive ought not to be hurried in this manner.

            Now this bill proposes to locate this College with the State University. And here I
              wish to submit a few considerations. I believe it is not in the power of the
              Legislature to locate this Agricultural College in connection with any other
              institution. I believe that in the law of Congress which provides these donations of
              lands it is intended that they shall be for separate institutions in all the States;
              and that we have no right to claim them as a benefaction for an institution that we
              have riot been able to keep up for ourselves. If our interests as a people are
              directed to any one pursuit more than any other, they are directed to the pursuit of
              Agriculture. We have gone on in the interests of education, and have established and
              maintained institutions for the purpose of teaching those branches of science and art
              in which literature and sciences are taught, and in which our people have been
              principally concerned. And Congress, looking over the vast interests of agriculture
              that are opening up in our great Western country, saw the great necessity for some
              adequate provision for the purpose of teaching agriculture, and to supply the want in
              our legislation that has been occasioned by those that have been opposed to any
              special act in the interests of agriculture. It was not for the purpose of bolstering
              up and giving strength to failing institutions, but on the contrary, this act of
              Congress was taken in the interests of agriculture and of the farming community-a
              donation of lands to enable us to develop this great country, to educate our boys to
              operate in the boundless interests of agriculture.

            Now I shall call the attention of the House to this act of Congress; and I see by its
              title that it is to provide for instruction "in agriculture and the mechanic
              arts," and not, as I have said, for the purpose of giving strength to other
              institutions of learning. I read from the copy in the acts of the General Assembly of
              1865:

            [He reads the first section-the grant of 30,000 acres to each Senator and
              Representative in Congress; the second section prescribing location and land scrip,
              "and the proceeds thereof to be applied to the uses and purposes prescribed in
              this act, and for no other use or purpose whatever ;" and the third section, all
              expenses to be paid by the States; and-]

            "SEC. 4. And be it further enacted, that all money derived
              from the sale of the lands aforesaid, by the State to which the lands are apportioned,
              and from the sales of the land scrip hereinbefore provided for, shall be invested in
              stocks of the United States or some other said stocks, yielding no less than five per
              centum upon the par value of said stocks, and that the money so invested shall
              constitute a perpetual fund, the capital of which shall remain forever undiminished,
              except so far as may be provide in section 5th of this act, and the interest of which
              shall be inevitably appropriated by each State, which may take and claim the benefit
              fit of this act, to the endowment, support and maintenance of at least one college,
              where the leading object shall be, without excluding other  scientific and classical studies, and including military
              tactics, to teach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and the
              mechanical arts," etc.

            The law of Congress says, the great object hall be for the purpose of teaching a
              school where agriculture shall be the leading object;and now, by the bill before the
              House, it is proposed to engraft this institution upon the Indiana University, whose
              leading objects of instruction are everything else. The State University is a
              corporate body, with its Board of Trustees, and in its charter the law provides that
              such branches of learning shall be taught in that University as its Trustees shall
              prescribe. And if those Trustees do not see fit to prescribe the teaching of
              agriculture, then, if you engraft this college upon it, the law of Congress will not
              be complied with. Its object may be defeated by the five men you may have there for
              Trustees. Thus, the leading object of the State University is one thing, and the
              leading object of the donation of Congress for an Agricultural College is quite
              another thing. But, say gentlemen who propose to establish this College in connection
              with the State University, they do teach agriculture. and also military tactics in the
              State University. And I believe there is there a Professor of military tactics. But
              the agricultural chair, which is to be the leading object of this College, you can not
              find in the State University. Why, sir, the State University is made by the
              Constitution the head of the common school system of the Professors of the State
              University State Superintendent of Public Instruction shall deliver lectures annually
              in fifteen counties of the State in the interest of the State University. Hence its
              leading object can not be instructions in agriculture, which the law of Congress
              requires for this College. 

            Again the law of Congress provides :

            "SEC. 5. And be it further enacted, that the pant of land and
              scrip hereby authorized shall be made on the following conditions to which, as well as
              to the provision hereinbefore contained, the previous assent of the several States
              shall be signified by legislative act.

            "First. If any portion of the fund invested, provided by the foregoing section,
              or any portion of the interest thereon, shall, by any action or contingency, be
              diminished or lost, it shall be replaced by the State to which it belongs," etc. 

            If this fund is not used strictly as it is required to be used by this fourth
              section, the State becomes liable for it. Why, sir, if you engraft it upon the State
              Institution the State of Indiana, under this act, becomes liable for the amount of the
              donation. The law of Congress regards this Agricultural College as a distinct and
              separate institution. It provides for the Board that shall govern the course of its
              studies, and the whole machinery of its business. And you can not embarrass it by
              connecting it with any other institution. We can not, however much we might desire it,
              plant this Agricultural Institution in the bosom of any of our State Institutions, and
              make it part and parcel of this Institution. For the law says:

            "Third - Any State which shall take and claim the benefit of the provision of
              this act, shall provide within five years, not less than one college, as prescribed in
              the fourth section of this act, or the grant to such State shall cease, and said State
              shall be bound to pay to the United States the amount received of any lands previously
              sold, and that the title to purchase under the State shall be valid." - Section 5. third clause.

            Supposing now this Institution to be connected with a school or college different in
              character from that which the law says they shall be, does not the State of Indiana
              become liable for the whole amount of the money received as the proceeds of this
              donation? We ought to be careful, then, how we proceed in this matter. If this
              condition be not complied with; if we give up this endowment to the control of a
              college of a character which the law does not contemplate, the State of Indiana will
              have to refund to the United States all the money it has thus received. Sir, is the
              State University an Institution whose leading object is agriculture? The law of
              Congress says this endowment is intended for an institution whose leading object is
              agriculture; and, if the State does not furnish that kind of a college, the State must
              pay back the money. Then, I say, sir, found if you can with this endowment, an
              institution in the State of Indiana, whose leading object shall be agriculture; and
              when you shall have done that, you will have complied with the law of Congress.

            But gentlemen answer me by saying, we will make that the leading object of the State
              University. Are you willing to abandon the course of instruction heretofore pursued in
              the Indiana University, and in which I understand there are now thirty-five young men
              nearly ready to take their diplomas ? Are you going to abandon all that the State
              University has been, and prescribe that henceforth its leading object shall be
              agriculture, for the sake of getting this donation from Congress? Then you are simply
              abandoning your State University. For we all know what it has been. We all know that
              it has not been an institution whose leading object has been agriculture. It is very
              evident that, by this bill, you must change either the one or the other of these
              institutions, for they are just as different as two institutions can be made.

            Now, Mr. Speaker, the main question, as I conceive, in this business, is as to the
              location of this Institution. And, for this purpose, I think we ought to go outside of
              our preferences among colleges. This is given to us by the General Government, with
              the expectation that we will make some good use of it. If I were to look alone to my
              individual preferences, I might go back to the Old Wabash College-to that institution
              where I was brought into intellectual culture, and which, I believe, is the best
              institution of learning in the State. And next to that, I would look to the College in
              my own town; and perhaps I would not say next to Wabash College, if I were to speak
              the sentiments of my people. For Asbury University is the most prosperous school in
              the State; having graduated more students, as I would say good ones at that, than any
              other in the State. But I shall not say, therefore, locate  the Agricultural College with Asbury University. I want
              gentlemen on this floor to distinctly understand that Putnam county makes no
              proposition here for the connection of this Institution with Asbury University. Her
              representatives here have nothing to do with it. Her proposition is a free offering,
              gotten up by the Putnam county farming community, asking for the location of the
              Agricultural College for the purpose of advancing the great farming interests of the
              State.

            Now, sir, when I shall have offered a few considerations in regard to this location,
              I believe I shall "have said all I have to say. At the last session of this body
              the gentleman from Monroe, now the honorable Speaker, made a speech on this subject of
              an Agricultural College, in which he urged that the State of Indiana should establish
              an Agricultural College some where in the State, and I concur with him in that. But he
              also said, that this Institution should be connected with the State University,
              because of the facilities for its establishment in that locality. Now, as the
              gentleman himself admitted some time during last winter, the town of Bloomington and
              the State University in Monroe county, are situated down there on a long, narrow,
              crooked railroad-one of the worst railroads in the State-so poor that, if the iron
              were taken off, the Company would not be able to replace it. But what says the
              gentleman in this speech? why, he insists that Monroe is one of the best counties, and
              has produced some of the best men, in the State. Well, sir, I am well acquainted with
              some good citizens down there. They have good men down theremen earnest in the cause
              of education-men who want this college there, not only for the sake of the State
              Institution, but because it might otherwise advance their own interests. But the
              gentleman wholly forgets and ignores the claims of the county of Putnam; and so far
              have they been ignored generally by the gentlemen here, that I had to announce but
              this morning to the gentleman from Marion (Mr. Stanton) that Putnam county is in the
              ring, competing for this location. Now, sir, I desire to institute a little comparison
              between the counties of Monroe and Putnam, as to their productiveness, which is the
              best index of the character of any locality. In the year 1860, in orchard products,
              Monroe county produced the value of $10,000; Putnam county, $36,553, and to-day (as my
              colleague [Mr. Neff] suggests) it might be set down to three times that amount. Of
              market and garden products, Monroe county produced $250. What a splendid set of
              gardeners down there! Putnam county produced $1,094. Of butter products - (we are all
              interested in the question of butter, as well as the students down in Monroe) Monroe
              county produced 195,470 lbs. Putnam, 356,180 lbs. I find these figures in the census
              statistics of 1860. I do not speak of these for prejudice against Monroe county, but
              merely to show the agricultural standing of the two counties. But, to proceed: Monroe
              county in its manufacturing interests has been traveling along at a pretty rapid rate;
              but Put Putnam excels her more than four fold; and in population, in 1860, she
              exceeded that of Monroe by over eight thousands. I am only showing the place that you
              are selecting for an Agricultural College; and I ask you if you will establish this
              college in a county which compares so unfavorably with other localities seeking for
              its location?

            But gentlemen say: It is is a better offer then. Monroe county has been very liberal,
              I admit-as liberal as any in the State, according to its ability. Certainly they are
              entitled to credit for what they have done. But it is said by some, that they offer
              the State University buildings, its laboratory its library, and the beautiful grounds
              surrounding it! And it would be just as modest, and just as reasonable, to say that
              Monroe county will give "University Square in this city, or that she will give
              this Capitol and these grounds surrounding it, as that she will give the buildings and
              grounds at Bloomington! Sir, they have no more right and power to give that State
              University than had that famous individual of old the right to give the broad realms
              of this world and the glory of them to the Saviour, if he would fall down and worship
              him! They of Monroe do not possess those buildings for the State University. They
              belong to the State of Indiana. And it is the duty of the State to take care of
              them-not turn them into a garden school.

            Now, sir, what has Putnam county offered? She has assured you that her bonds will be
              issued for one hundred thousand dollars, bearing seven per cent, interest; and that
              she will furnish forty acres of land, if yon will locate the Agricultural College
              within her borders. We do not say you shall locate it with the Asbury; with an
              institution into whose nostrils you will not have to breathe new life every few years,
              as is now the case with the State University. For we haves University there,
              self-sustaining, which is today a leading institution in the West; which is now laying
              its broad and deep foundations for a new building that will cost one hundred and
              twenty thousand dolars, towards which the State of Indiana is not to be asked to
              contribute a single dollar. The people who are standing by that Institution are able,
              and willing and determined to sustain it, and make in a school of instruction as good
              as any that may be found in the land. Through Putnam county, fortunately for us, is
              located the great thoroughfare of the nation, between the rising and the setting sun.
              Outside of this city, we have the best railroad connections in the State, and new
              corporation is about to construct for us another.

            Mr. NEFF interposed. We are also on the road that runs through
              Bloomingtoon, but we don't count that. [Laughter.]

            Mr. OSBORN continuing. Then I say that on this great thoroughfare
              to the Pacific, Putnam county is a point that invites the localion of an Institution
              of this kind. Our soil is surpassed by none in the State. Our  stock raising and our farming stock are surpassed by none.
              I think we have the best horses; we are but second class in the State as to cattle,
              and we have the best mules. [Laughter.] Then tell me sir, if it were to be expected of
              a committee here, looking to the interests of a great Agricultural College, that they
              would spurn such an offer as ours, and locate it down among the knobs of Monroe
              county!

            As for the State University there, the history of that institution shows that it has
              required a great effort on the part of its friends and on the part of the Legislature
              to keep it alive. It has been like a tree planted in a strange climate - a shrub in a
              foreign, unfriendly soil. It is a sickly, puny institution, eternally at the
              Legislature asking for more help, and it is now receiving $8,000 a year to keep it up.
              Still I am in favor of sustaining that institution, and I am only insisting that it is
              not a good place whereon to engraft this Agricultural College, for which Congress has
              given us an endowment. To engraft it on a shrub of this kind, does it not look like
              engrafting a rose-bud into a last year's mullen-stock? 

          
          
          
          
        
        

        
          IN SENATE.

          
            MONDAY, May 3, 1869.
          

          The Senate met at 2 o'clock P. M., pursuant to adjournment-the
            LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR in the Chair.

          On motion by Mr. ROBINSON, of Madison,the reading of the Secretary's minutes of
            the last session was dispensed with. 

          
            BILLS FOR ACTS.

             Mr. BRADLEY demanded a call of the Senate, but upon the request of a number of
              Senators, for manifest reasons, withdrew his demand, and obtained leave to introduce a
              bill [S. 347] to organize and establish criminal courts in and for the counties of
              Laporte and St. Joseph, &c., which was read the first and second time under a
              dispensation and referred to a special committee.

            Mr. GREEN introduced a bill [S. 348] making provision for citizens of any town where
              the plat has been recorded to make application to the County Commissioners for the
              donation or setting apart of any designated public square for common school purposes,
              which was read the first Mid second time under a suspension and referred to a select
              committee. 

          
          

          
            JUSTICES' FEES.

             Mr. FOSDICK, from the Committee on Fees and Salaries, returned
              the bill [H. R. 73] to amend section 15 of the fees-of-officers'-bill of March 2,
              1855, in relation to the fees of Justices of the Peace, with amendments, and when so
              amended recommended its passage.

            Mr. GREENE was of opinion that Justices' fees should be raised, and hoped the
              bill would pass as it comes from the House. He feared the delay consequent upon the
              adoption of the amendments would kill the bill

            Mr. FOSDICK said the bill proposed to double the fees of Justices for issuing
              summonses, and adds fees for docketing and entering satisfaction; and that was too
              much of an increase. He hoped the Committee's amendments would be concurred
              in.

            The amendments were adopted. 

          
          

          
            PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS.

             Mr. CAVIN, by leave, presented a claim, which was referred to the Committee
                on Claims, without reading.

            Mr. KINLEY presented the following Memorial of the Indianapolis Board of Managers of
              the "House for Friendless Women" in behalf of the Indiana Reformatory
              Institution for women and girls.

            
              
                
                  
                  
                    To the Senate and House of Representatives:
                  

                  GENTLEMEN:-Your memorialists have long been interested in
                    the claims of the friendless of our own sex upon the public for sympathy and
                    assistance in reaching a life of industry, usefulness and virtue. Our labors
                    have not been without their good fruits, and many under our observation and
                    watchful care have been turned from the path of sorrow and wretchedness to one
                    of peace and hope and joy.

                  The General Assembly two years ago made a liberal and beneficient provision for
                    the protection of the homeless and friendless boys of the State, who, for want
                    of counsel and parental care, are under the controling influence of profanity,
                    theft and crime. This benefaction has already proven a blessing, and will bring
                    forth good fruits for many years to come. Must our homeless and friendless
                    daughters, who are alike waifs upon the world without a friendly counsellor,
                    constantly exposed to crime, and in the path of ruin not so much because of any
                    predisposing fault of their own as because parents, church and State has failed
                    to give them sympathy and to inspire them to seek a better and higher life, now
                    fail to find the protecting shield of the State thrown over them? Our jails find
                    no suitable home for those who have been so unfortunate as to be sent thither,
                    and our courts are deterred from executing the demands of justice because the
                    ends of the penal law cannot be reached without degrading them, and the erring
                    are set at liberty to seek, again" the companionship of vice.

                  All our cities and villages are waiting for the relief your timely aid can give
                    them.

                  We trust in the disposal of the bill before you, wise and worthy counsels will
                    prevail.  We feel that a generous and
                    approving response will greet you from your constituents on your return, when
                    they learn you are not only the friends of the orphan and the afflicted, but of
                    the unfortunate and the erring.

                  May God grant that you may have true and manly hearts in this good work. We
                    embrace this opportunity to assure you that the provisions of the bill which
                    contemplate the removal of female convicts to an adjoining department of the
                    Reformatory, are meant to be economic. Their labor can be turned to good account
                    in meeting the expenses of the Institution, while at the same time we conceive
                    they will be placed in more favorable circumstances for moral discipline and
                    reformation. We believe the more carefully you consider the provisions of the
                    bill the more will its merits be seen to sustain you in its support. We would
                    therefore earnestly ask you to secure its passage.

                  
                    With great respect, and in behalf of the association above
                      named.
                    ELIZA J. NEWMAN,
                        President.
                     SARAH R. KAPPES,

              on the lands of the Northwestern Christian University, and accepting the donations of
              said University, and the donation of the Fletcher heirs, and the donation of Marion
              county,] which was read the first time and passed to the second reading.

            BILLS ON THE THIRD READING.

             On motion by Mr. HADLEY, the bill [S. 323] to legalize the acts of Justices of the

              the third time and passed the Senate by yeas 36, nays 0.

            The Printing Committee's bill [S. 216], making appropriations
              for the publication of the reports of the State Board of Agriculture, coming up-

            On motion of Mr. FISHER, it was laid on the table.

            Mr. Green's bill [S. 218], for the better regulation of the traffic on railroads
              coming up, it was read the third time.

            Mr. GREEN explained that the bill applied more to Indianapolis than any other city in
              the State; it requiring the railroads to take freight in succession, or, in other
              words, to grind the turns as they come.

            Mr. FISHER rather thought the bill should not pass. Such things as the transfer of
              freight always regulate themselves the course of time. 

            Mr. GREEN could not imagine what part  of the
              bill the Senator dislikes. He recited cases in which such a law as this would be Cf
              great benefit to the traveling public.

            Mr FISHER did not see why a fine in such a case should be levied for the benefit of
              the school or any other fund. If the railroad companies should pay for damanges done
              to passengers on account of delays, the fines should more properly go to the parties
              damaged.

            Mr. SCOTT was of the opinion that the bill should be entitled "An act to scare
              up law suits." He regarded it as absurd to attempt to regulate the transfer of
              freight or baggage by railroad companies.

            Mr. GREEN declared the purpose of his bill to be to compel these Railroad Companies
              to treat all alike - it was but right that the baggage masters should treat all
              Railroads alike.

            On motion by Mr. BIRD the bill was indefinitely postponed.

            Mr. HADLEY's bill [S. 224] to legalize the use of a seal for the Adjutant
              General's office, was read the third time.

            Mr. CARSON desired to know how far the passage of this bill would legalize the acts
              of that officer, or if it would affect them at all. He could not see why the Adjutant
              General should have a seal. He feared that the bill was for some other purpose.

            Mr. HADLEY stated cases where he thought the use of a seal by that officer was
              necessary. He and Mr. ROBINSON, of Madison, regarded a seal as necessary for the
              Adjutant General as for the Secretary of State.

            The bill failed to pass for want of a constitutional majority - yeas 22, nays 12.Mr.
              Kinley's bill [S. 225] changing the name of the State Board of Agriculture to the
              "Indiana State Industrial Board," was read the first time.

            Mr. KINLEY explained that the object of the bill was to make the Agricultural Society
              the representative of Industry in name as it really was in fact. Since the
              introduction of the bill members of the State Board have changed their minds on the
              subject; and, consequently, on his motion the bill was laid on the table.

            Mr. Kinley's bill [S. 251] to amend section 1 of the act of March 9, 1867,
              authorizing towns and cities to levy taxes for school purposes, being read the third
              time -

            Mr. KINLEY explained its provisions. It allows on petition an increase of assessment
              for school purposes, etc.

            Mr. CARSON said the people now complained bitterly of oppressive taxes and the most
              of it is in the shape of local taxation. He opposed this species of legislation.

            Mr. GREEN could see no wrong nor harm in allowing the people to tax themselves. In
              his section they needed this law very much, and he hoped it would pass.

            Mr. BRADLEY was of opinion that the Constitution prohibited this class of
              legislation.

            The bill failed to pass for want of a Constitutional majority-yeas 21, nays 13.

            Mr. Bellamy's bill [S. 108] amending section 2 of the Registry law, was read the
              third time.

            Mr. BRADLEY moved that the bill be laid on the table.

            The motion was rejected by yeas 8, nays 27.

            Mr. BELLAMY explained the only amendments, of the law to be to provide that not only
              the Judges of Elections, but that the clerks also shall be equally divided between the
              two dominant political parties.

            Mr. BRADLEY insisted that the bill was imperfect-it requires semi-annual meetings of
              the Registry Board; and we have passed a bill providing for biennial elections.

            Mr. FISHER moved that the bill be recommitted, with instructions to amend it so as to
              provide for but one registry in two years.

            The motion was agreed to.

            Mr. Lasselle's bill [S. 139] to revise and amend section 6 of the plank,
              Macadamized and gravel road law of 1852, was read the third time.

            Mr. GREEN opposed the provision authorizing the roads to condemn material within a
              mile and a half of the road bed. He was a friend to gravel roads, but would not
              justify the grant of that extended power to these corporations.

            Mr. LASALLE said similar powers are granted to common roads; and he saw nothing wrong
              in the provision alluded to. There was ample provision made for compensation to the
              owner of such condemned material. The bill accords with the general provisions of law
              on this subject. Properly improved roads are indispensable in many portions of the
              State; and as gravel roads are the very best roads we can get now, we ought to
              encourage them. We have encouraged them to some extent, and probably in some cases
              gone too far in that direction. He saw nothing wrong in the bill, and thought no
              oppression could arise out of its operation.

            The bill failed to pass for want of a Constitutional majority-yeas 20, nays 15.

            And then the Senate adjourned till 9 o'clock to-morrow morning under the rules. 

          
          

        
        

        
          HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.

           The House met at 2 o'clock P. M. pursuant to adjournment, and
            in the absence of the Speaker-

          

          On motion of Mr. OSBORN, Mr. Stanton of Marion, was called to the chair.

          Mr. OSBORN asked and obtained unanimous consent to introduce a bill [H. R. 390] to
            declare the meaning of certain records and the proper construction thereof of the first
            section of the act authorizing the assessment of all lands within one and one-half miles
            of any road, etc.

          It is to make the same of the road acts of March 5, 1867, and of the road law of
            1852.

          Mr. RUDDELL obtained leave to introduce a bill [H. R. 391] to amend section four of the
            act authorizing the construction of roads, approved March 12, 1852.

          Mr. WILLIAMS, of Hamilton, returned Mr. Wildman's weights and measures bill [H. R.
            104]; and

          Mr. JOHNSTON, of Parke, from the special committee thereon, returned Mr. Wile's
            city land tax bill [H. R. 153], with an amendment, by way of substitute; which bills
            were passed to their places in the calendar.

          On motion of Mr. LONG (by unanimous consent) the bill [S. 51] in reference to the partition of real estate, was taken up and passed
            the first reading.

          On motion by Mr. RUDDELL, (by unanimous consent) the Senate amendment to his bill [H. R. 64] to prescribe the Twelfth Common Pleas
            District (Marion and Hendricks) was taken up and concurred in. 

          
            THE CALENDAR.

             The SPEAKER, stating, that, as there is no ascertained quorum present, to avoid
              difficulty about questions for suspending the order of business, the Chair, with the
              consent of the House, would direct the consideration of bills of the House on the
              second-reading. Whereupon, bills originating in the House of Representatives of the
              following titles were read the second time, and (if not otherwise disposed of as
              hereinafter noted) ordered to be engrossed.

            Mr. Fairchild's bill [H. R, 293] to amend section 16 of the County Surveyor act
              of March 5, 1859.

            Mr. Furnace's bill [H. R. 296] to amend section 11 of the act of March 8, 1867
              to establish a House of Refuge.

            Mr. Johnson of Marshall's bill [H. R. 300] to provide for the publication of the
              proceedings of the County Commissioners.

            Mr. McDonald's bill [H. R. 302] to provide for the drainage of swamp lands.

            Mr. Miles' bill [H. R. 304] declaring that all sectional lines shall be open as
              public highways.

            Mr. Minor's bill [H. R. 305] to amend clause 53 of section 53 of the General
              City Corporation act of March 14, 1867.

            Mr. Carnahan's bill [H. R. 329] to amend sections 9 and 49 of the act of June
              17,1852, for the settlement of decedents' tates.

            Mr. Jump's bill [H. R. 163] to the erection and maintenance of nuisances on or
              adjoining grounds belonging to the State.

            Mr. Davis, of Elkhart's, court bill [H.R. 254] was passed over till that
              gentleman shall be in his place.

            The joint resolution No. 13, for the re lief of Margaret Toombs, of Scott county

            Mr. Vater's bill [H. R. 245] to amend section 3 of the act authorizing plank

            Mr. Stanton's bill [H. R. 340] to appropriations for the benevolent institutions
              in cases where the Legislature may fail to pass the general bill, was passed over for
              action on the Senate bill for the same object.

            On motion of Mr. OSBORN, the Senate amendments to his Railroad consolidation bill
                [H. R. 322] were taken up and concurred in. 

            Mr. Smith's bill [H. R. 277] was in definitely postponed; having been superseded
              by a Senate bill.

            Mr. Hutson's bill [H. R. 298] for enabling Swamp Land Commissioners and
              Engineers to select such lands, &c.

            On motion by Mr. BOBO his bill [H.R 164] was taken up and placed in the Calendar.

            Mr. Wile's bill [H. R. 317] for the protection of manufacturers of Cotton and
              Woolen goods, with the committee's amendments thereto being taken up.

            On motion by Mr. OSBORN, it was on the table.

            Mr. Hyatt's bill [H. R. 299], to amend the 17th section of the act to amend the
              drainage act of June 12, 1852, and supplemental thereto.

            Mr. McDonald's bill [H. R. 318], to amend section three of the County
              Surveyor's act of June 17, 1852, coming up with the committee amndment-

            Mr. McDONALD said the object of the bill was this: Where the boundaries have been
              legally established within five years past, if either party desire a resurvey, he
              shall pay the expenses himself.

            Mr. RATLIFF said the amendment was to strike out the limitation of five years.

            The amendment was adopted, and so the bill was ordered to be engrossed. 

             Mr. Higbee's bill, [H. R. 154,] authorizing the Board of Commissioners to levy
              tax for the subscription and donations Railroads, coming up with the committee
              amendment by substitute-

            The amendment was adopted, and so the bill was ordered to the engrossment -

            Mr. GREEN giving notice that he should oppose the bill at every stage. He reefrained now from a motion to lay on the table
              because a quorum had not been ascertained, and the House desired to read up the
              calendar.

            Mr. Field's, of Lake, Ninth Circuit Court bill [H. R. 349], was was laid on the
              table as superseded matter.

            Mr. Sunman's bill [H. R. 379], relative to the estates of minor heirs:

            Mr. Welborn's joint resolution [H. R. 14], for the Southern District Court of
              the United States for the State of Indiana, at Evansville, was laid on the table at
              the request of several members represented by Mr. Pierce, of Vigo.

            Mr. Williams', of Union's, joint resolution [H. R. 15], requiring the State
              Printer to print 1,500 copies of the law concerning descendent's estates and the
              duties of guardians, to be distributed to the Clerks of the several counties, coming
              up -

            Mr. LONG moved that 1,500 copies of the same shall be in German.

            Mr. WILLIAMS, of Union, said that administrators want copies of that law for
              information concerning their duties, when it was not convenient for them to consult a
              lawyer. The resolution was for their accommodation.

            Mr. RATLIFF would like to know something about the cost. It might be twenty-five or
              thirty thousands dollars.

            Mr. JOHNSTON, of Parke, feared that copies of the laws on that subject would mislead
              as many administrators and guardians as it would inform correctly.

            Mr. WILLIAMS, of Union, proposed to amend the resolution by striking out State
              Printer, and inserting Secretary of State in lieu.

            On motion of Mr. WILLIAMS, of Hamilton, the joint resolution and pending amendments
              were referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.

            The SPEAKER laid before the House a communication from the Governor informing the
              House that the enrolled bill [H. R. 65]
              introduced by Mr. Osborn for an act amending section 15 of the Manufacturing
              Companies' general act of May 20, 1852, and defining the meaning of the word
              "annual" therein, became a law without his approval on the 30th day of
              April, 1869.

            Mr. Pierce, of Porter's bll [H. R. 371] to amend the law in relation to Public
              Highways coming up -

            Mr. PIERCE, of Porter, said it was to amend the law so that instead of the Trustees
              the Clerks and Auditors shall give the notice, &c.

            Mr. Zollars bill [H. R. 386] defining certain felonies, etc., making felonies
              committed in another State punishable the same as if the larceny had been committed in
              this State.

            Mr. Osborn's bill [H. R. 373] providing for the vacation of highways or streets,
              or portions of the same, and also for the re-opening of the same, coming up with the
                Judiciary Committee's amendment, striking out the word
              street wheresoever it occurs in the bill -

            Mr. OSBORN said that would be to strike out the whole bill. He was on the
                Judiciary Committee and did not know that this bill was ever
              considered there. He hoped the House would not concur in the amendment reported.

            Mr. JOHNSTON, of Parke, remembered the consideration of that bill by the
                Judiciary Committee. And we conceived there would be a difficulty
              about streets, and reported the amendment after due consideration. His understanding
              of the amendment was that it was to strike out streets and alleys both.

            Mr. OSBORN was satisfied that the committee did not know what they were doing.
              [Laughter.]

            On motion by Mr. JOHNSTON, of Parke, the bill was again referred to the
                Committee on the Judiciary, with instructions to report at an
              early day.

            Mr. Ratliff's bill [H. R. 212] to amend section 1 of the act to amend sections 1
              and 2 of the act to fix the per diem of members of the General Assembly, approved in
              1852, and March 4, 1865, coming up-

            Mr. LONG moved that it be indefinitely postponed.

            Mr. RATLIFF said the only object of the bill is to provide that members who are
              absent two or three weeks at home practicing law or taking care of their farms, shall
              get no pay for such absence. It allows pay for two days without leave, but not farther
              than that unless by special leave, or on account of sickness.

            Mr. FULLER said it took him four days, and the Senator from Perry five days to go
              home.

            Mr. LONG expected to come back again to the General Assembly, and of course he
              expected to ask for leave of absence, which he supposed would be granted to him as
              heretofore, and as heretofore he also would have leave to bolt if he wanted to.

            On motion of Mr. RATLIFF it was laid on the table. 

          
          

          
            PROSECUTIONS IN BASTARDY.

             Mr. Stephenson's bill [H. R. 313], to amend section fifteen of the act
              regulating prosecutions and cases in bastardy, approved May 16, 1852, coming up with
              the Judiciary Committee's amendment, adding: "Provided
              that the judgment shall not be enforced against the defendant by execution or
              otherwise until the birth of the child in question."

            Mr. STEPHENSON in support of the provisions of the bill, said, the only change  made in the present law was that proviso, and
              where a person is committed for this offence after being confined in jail three
              months, if he give the proper notice to the opposite party, and a proper showing to
              the Judge, he can be released if he can prove that he has no available means to
              satisfy the judgment. In other words, the bill is to avoid imprisonment for life for
              this offense, as may be done almost under the present law-to avoid indefinite
              confinement in those low county jails, which are worse than the penitentiary. With
              regard to that amendment he knew nothing.

            Mr. OSBORN. It provided for everything except the naming of the child.

            The SPEAKER [Mr. Stanton in the the chair]. Then all the individual would have to do
              would be to get up and leave the country, if he saw danger ahead.

            Mr. PIERCE, of Vigo. By this bill the law stands as it is, with the provision recited
              by the gentleman, and the object of the amendment was that money can not be collected
              till the birth of the child. He himself moved that amendment in committee, and he did
              it for this reason: He had known cases where persons were prosecuted for bastardy, and
              where judgments were obtained for $400 and $500, and the usual orders of the Court for
              the money to be paid, so much to be paid in one month, so much in sixty days, so much
              in ninety days. He had known such cases which turned out that the woman was never
              pregnant at all. And to cover such cases was the object of the amendment. It could be
              no hardship for a female, or rather for the child, (for that was the principal object
              of protection) to wait for the money till it is born, and if it is never born, it will
              never need it; or if the woman is riot pregnant, of course it would be wrong for the
              money to be paid at all.

            Mr. STEWART, of Ohio. It was now provided by law that the mother may compromise with
              the defendant by entering satisfaction on the record. Does the bill repeal that?

            Mr. PIERCE, of Vigo. No, sir. The reason of the law for these cases in bastardy was
              for the purpose of protecting the State or county from the expense of supporting the
              mother and child. And of course the county needs none of this money until the mother
              has incurred or is about to incur this expense.

            Mr. PIERCE, of Porter, inquired if the bill provides that the party by proving that
              he has no property may be discharged from custody, or from the judgment? If from the
              judgment that was wrong.

            Mr. STEPHENSON. It merely discharges him from custody.

            The amendment of the Committee was then adopted.

            Mr. BOBO proposed further to amend by striking out three months and insert six months
              in lieu. He considered that ninety days is too short a time for such defendant to lie
              in jail.

            Mr. STEPHENSON hoped it would be adopted. The object was to obtain the amount of the
              judgment; and why run the State or the county to the expense of keeping the prisoner
              in jail six months, when is known that he has no means. The bill provides that if he
              can show to the satisfaction of the judge that he has no property-that he can not
              replevy the judgment-then it is in the discretion of the court to discharge him. Why
              not then, release him at the end of "three months ? That is certainly a
              sufficient term of imprisonment, to uncover all the arrangements he may have made for
              getting his property out of his hands. Let us have it three months, and then if he can
              make a fair showing let him be released; if not, let him lie in jail.

            Mr. JOHNSTON, of Parke, proposed to amend the amendment by striking out
              "six" and inserting "nine" in lieu.

            On motion of Mr. ZENOR, the amendment and the amendment to the amendment, were laid
              on the table.

            Mr. NEFF proposed to amend by adding these words: "Provided that the provisions
              of this act shall not be extended to any person now in jail on the charge of
              bastardy."

            Mr. STEPHENSON said he knew of cases of men in jail who have been lying there for
              years, and he did not see any reason for such confinement. These jails were worse than
              the penitentiaries-were kept in a worse condition. It was as good as the death penalty
              for a man to be sent into them for any stated time. Then why impose on the counties
              this additional expense?

            Mr. NEFF was not particular about the amendment. He was opposed to the whole bill. He
              did not think the penalty any too great. When a man is placed in prison for such an
              offense he ought to stay there till he rots. It would not cost the county more to keep
              such a man in jail than to let him run at large.

            Mr. STEWART, of Ohio. If the gentleman was not particular about his amendment, he
              would move to lay it on the table.

            The amendment was laid on the tablet accordingly.

            Mr. NEFF then moved to lay the bill on the table.

            The motion was rejected; and then-

            The bill was ordered to the engrossment. 

          
          

          
            THE CALENDAR.

             Mr. Fuller's bill [H. R. 51] to amend section of the act to fix the time of
              holding  Common Pleas, &c., approved March
              5th, 1859, was ordered to the engrossment.

            On motion by Mr. DAVIDSON, the Court bill for his circuit was taken up; and he
              proposed to amend by allowing Fulton county two weeks to hold Court if the business
              thereof require it.

            The amendment was adopted and the bill passed to the engrossment.

            Mr. Gordon's bill [H. R. 353] to fix the salaries of county officers was laid on
              the table, being superseded by a Senate bill. 

          
          

          
            EMPLOYES OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY.

             Mr. Monroe's bill [H. R. 306], fixing the per diem and mileage of members of
              the General Assembly-the compensation of Secretaries, Clerks and Doorkeepers, and
              their employes-being taken up with the amendment of the Special Committee thereon by
              way of _ substitute, proposing this title: "To provide for the election of
              officers of the two Houses of the General Assembly, fixing their pay; defining their
              duties, repealing all laws in conflict with this act, and declaring when this act
              shall take effect.

            It provides for the election of one Clerk and one Doorkeeper for each House. The pay
              of each Clerk $50 a day and each Doorkeeper $40 for each day of the session of the
              General Assembly the Clerks and Doorkeeper to provide the necessary clerical and
              police force at their own expense.

            Mr. PIERCE, of Porter, indicated a motion to lay on the table.

            Mr. JOHNSTON, of Parke, moved that it be indefinitely postponed. The compensation was
              unequal. There was more labor required for these employes in the House, than those in
              the Senate.

            Mr. FULLER was informed that this bill would save $7,500 for each regular session;
              and he was also informed by intelligent gentlemen that the work could be performed for
              that money.

            On motion of Mr. PIERCE of Porter, the bill was laid on the table for the
              present.

            Mr. Mason's bill [H. R. 361] to enable railroad companies who have formed
              articles of association, naming the counties through which they pass, to perfect their
              organization.

            Mr. Overmeyer's bill [H. R. 370] to amend section 133 of the Common School
              law.

            Mr. Coffroth's bill (H. R. 330) to abolish certain officers provided for in the
              general City Corporation act, and transferring their duties to the office of the City
              treasurer.

            The SPEAKER said this bill was to assign the duties of Assessor to the City
              Treasurer, and to make the appraisements for taxation for State and County purposes
              the basis for City taxation. But property is appraised for State and County purposes
              only once in five years, and in many Cities the amount of property would be doubled in
              that time.

            Mr. ODELL moved to amend by including towns in the provisions of the bill.

            Mr. PIERCE, of Vigo, desired the gentleman from Shelby to withdraw his amendment,
              though he had no doubt it might be acceptable to the gentleman from Huntington.

            Mr. LONG also desired to amend the bill.

            Mr. PIERCE, of Vigo, would be glad to have it made a special order for some Certain
              day.

            Mr. LONG objected to special orders, to the exclusion of more important bills.

            Mr. PIERCE did not think there is a more important bill on the files.

            So it was passed over.

            Mr. Pierce's (of Porter) bill requiring the State Printer to fix the cost of
              printing and binding on the title page of all books, bills and documents printed by
              order, &c., coming up-

            On motion by Mr. PIERCE, it was laid on the table.

            Mr. Higgins' bill [H. R. 356] to enable the occupants of lands not surveyed by
              the United States, and bordering on lakes, &c., to hold the same, coming up-

            Mr. CHAPMAN said it was a bill sent to him, which he had obtained the favor of Mr.
              Higgins to introduce. And after further explanation by Mr. Chapman, Mr. Davidson, Mr.
              Pierce, of Porter, Mr. Barnet, and others-

            It was laid on the table.

            Mr. Welborn's bill [H. R. 220] to authorize the amendment of bills of exception
              in certain cases, coming up-

            Mr. NEFF moved, ineffectually, for its indefinite postponement; and, then-

            It was ordered to the engrossment.

            Mr. McDonald's bill [H. R. 175] to provide for special terms of the Courts to
              settle issues and preliminary motions and orders in actions pending therein and
              preparations for the trial of said actions.

            Mr. Sleeth's bill [H. R. 170] to amend section 8 of the act providing for the
              election of clerks of the Circuit Courts, &c., coming up with the committee
              amendments striking out section 8 and inserting section 7, which were concurred
              in.

            And then these bills were ordered to the engrossment.

            Mr. Smith's bill [H. R. 375] to amend section 29 of the Justices' act of
              June 9, 1852.Mr. Kercheval's bill [H. R. 314] to amend the act providing for the
              settlement of decedents estates, &c.

            Mr. Pierce of Vigo's bill [H. R. 312] 
              making it a misdemeanor to charge a female with unchastity, etc.

            Mr. Williams of Knox's bill [H. R. 384] concerning deeds for school, saline,
              university, sinking fund and other lands belonging to the trust funds of the State,
              and legalizing deeds heretofore made for such lands.

            Mr. Calvert's bill to amend section 156 of the practice act.

            Mr. Tebbs' bill [H. R. 380] to amend section 27 of the common school law of
              March 6, 1865.

            Mr. Ruddell's prison bill [H. R. 387] was laid on the table, being superseded by
              the bill S. 130.

            Mr. Zollers' bill [H. R. 315] to authorize county boards to make appropriations
              for county asylums, was laid on the table.

            Mr. Dunn's bill [H. R. 292] to amend the first section of the county
              Sheriff's act.

            Mr. Stephenson's bill [H. R. 392] to authorize the Clerk of the Supreme Court to
              have the papers on file in his office indexed, allowing him such compensation therefor
              as the judges of said court may from time to time certify such services to be
              worth.

            Which bills were severally passed to the engrossment.

            Mr. RUDDELL submitted the following, which was adopted by consent:

            
              
                
                  
                    Resolved, (The Senate concurring), That the Secretary of State
                    shall cause to be printed and distributed to the several counties of the State
                    10,000 copies of the Road Laws, in pamphlet form, for the use of
                    Supervisors.
                
              
            

            Mr. -- introduced a bill [H. R. 393] to amend section 60, of the Practice act of June
              18, 1852, in regard to the granting of new trials.

            The House then adjourned. 

          
          

        
        

        
          IN SENATE.
          
             TUESDAY, May 4, 1869. 
          

          The Senate met at 9 o'clock A, M. On motion by Mr. JAQUESS, the reading of the
            Secretary's minutes of yesterday was dispensed with. 

          
            REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.

             Mr. BRADLEY, from the special committee thereon, returned his bill [S. 347] to
              establish Criminal Courts in the counties of Laporte and St. Joseph, recommending its
              passage.

            On his further motion, the order of business was dispensed with, and the bill was
              road the third time and passed the Senate by yeas 26, nays 13.

            Mr. FISHER, from a majority of the select committee to which was referred the Court
              bill [H. R. 11] reported a substitute therefor,
              creating the Twenty-second Judicial District.

            Mr. ARMSTRONG asked and obtain leave to submit a minority report at some future
              time.

            Mr. FISHER urged haste in the matter - he feared delay.

            Mr. GREEN, from the Special Committee thereon, returned his townplat petition for
              school buildings bill [S. 348] introduced yesterday, recommending its passage.

            On his further motion, his bill was read the third time, the order of business being
              suspended for that purpose.

            Mr. GREEN explained its provisions. It was especially intended to apply to the town
              of Sharpesville, so that citizens can petition that a certain square may be used
              exclusively for school purposes. The bill passed by yeas 36, nays 4. 

            Mr. STEIN, from the Committee on Organization of Courts, returned
              the court bill [H. R. 341] with amendments,
              striking out the word "Morgan."

            Mr. ROBINSON, of Decatur, moved to amend the amendment by substituting
              "Shelby" for "Morgan," and gave reason for desiring the
              change.

            Mr. HENDERSON knew of objections by the attorneys of Morgan county to going into this
              new circuit. He hoped the committee's amendment would be agreed to and the bill
              passed as amended.

            Mr. BELLAMY desired to see both amendments laid on the table.

            Mr. HADLEY reminded Senators that Johnson county was now without a court, and he
              hoped there would be no trouble about this bill, for fear Johnson county would not be
              provided for this session.

            Mr. LEE said Bartholomew county desired more time; and he would like to see the bill
              amended in that respect.

            Mr. TAGGART hoped the bill would pass as it came from the House.

            After further remarks by Mr. Hanna and Mr. Bellamy, the latter made an ineffectual
              motion to lay the amendments on the table.

            The amendment to the amendment was rejected.

            Mr. TURNER, understanding that a majority of the citizens interested desired the bill
              as it came from the House, favored its passage without amendment.

            Mr. HENDERSON had petitions both ways on this subject, but believed a majority of the
              citizens of Morgan county desired the bill amended as proposed by the Committee.

            Mr. DENBO suggested that the bill be taken as it comes from the House, because the
              end of the session is so near at hand.

            The committee amendment was agreed to by yeas 32, nays 12.

            Mr. BELLAMY moved to amend by striking Bartholemew county from the bill.

            

            On motion by Mr. HENDERSON the amendment was laid on the table.

            Mr. ROBINSON of Decatur moved to amend by adding a section affecting his county-the
              courts may hold as long as business requires.

            The amendment was agreed to.

            On motion by Mr. LEE the bill was further amended by granting one week's more
              time to the Bartholomew Court.

            The bill, as amended, passed the Senate by yeas 35, nays 7, with an amendment of
              title. 

          
          

          
            AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE.

             The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR announced the special order for this hour being the
              consideration of Mr. Stein's bill [S.
              156], accepting certain donations from John Purdue and others, and locating and
              naming the said Agricultural College. (Locating it in Tippecanoe county, and naming it
              "Purdue University.")

            Mr. HANNA moved to recommit the bill with instructions to strike out from the
              enacting clause, and substitute therefor new matter, locating the Agricultural College
              at Bloomington in connection with the State University.

            Mr. HANNA had an idea that an Agricultural College isolated and alone could not be
              maintained; that in order to the success of such an institution it must be connected
              with some university. The adoption of his substitute would at once raise the State
              University to a high place among the institutions of learning in this country. We
              ought to hesitate before we undertake to establish this College disconnected from any
              other institution of learning; for if this is done, year after year it will be coming
              up asking for appropriation after appropriation to keep it alive. He understood that
              no other buildings would be needed at Bloomington to carry on this Agricultural
              College there. He insisted this College located anywhere disconnected with any
              institution of learning would surely not be self-sustaining, and appropriations would
              necessarily have to be made for its support from time to time. The Legislature ought
              not to look to the wishes of the people in this matter, but should look solely to the
              good we can do, in disposing of this great trust, to the rising generation.

            Mr TURNER desired to see this question deposed of. He desired to see no more time
              consumed upon it, It is impossible to locate this Agricultural College at Bloomington.
              There are but two great contending parties here, neither of which is Bloomington. As
              between these two he had nothing to say at present. Regarding it as a fixed fact that
              the location will be made either in Indianapolis or Tippecanoe county, he opposed the
              substitute.

            Mr. MORGAN had always favored connecting the Agricultural College with the University
              at Bloomington. It is very important to every citizen of the State that the
              Agricultural interest should be husbanded and brought to its fullest perfection. He
              opposed the establishing of a separate college, and having two sickly institutions
              relying upon the State for support. Should the Legislature determine not to unite this
              fund with the State University, he favored giving it to some institution to use on its
              own hook, and not make the State liable to be called upon year after year for
              appropriations for its support.

            Mr. GRAY came up at the beginning of the last session as a passive Senator on this
              question, because his constituents have no preference as to where this college shall
              be located. Last session he voted where-ever he thought his vote would be likely to
              locate it, but on hearing the offer of Hon. John Purdue read, he thought he should
              vote to locate this college in Tippecanoe county, from the fact that the otter was
              made by an individual against whom no objection could be made. He agreed with the
              Senator from Sullivan that the propositions for the donation of money made by County
              Commissioners are very uncertain; and he regarded the propositions coming from
              Tippecanoe county as infinitely better than any that has yet been made.

            Mr. CRAVENS did not want to discuss this question, for his views are well known. The
              amendment was exactly in the line of his preference, and he desired a test vote upon
              it. All these local propositions had not the weight of a pin. The State of Indiana is
              a bidder for this Agricultural College, and the best bidder in the market. Her
              resources and her ambition to make it what it should be will far exceed any locality
              in the State. If, upon a test question, it is decided that the State will not add this
              fund to the State University, then he had his preference. There is but one valid bid
              before the Senate as far as localities are concerned, and that is the bid of an
              individual who has the ability to carry out his designs and the ambition to back his
              ability.

            Mr. HANNA readily assented to arid adopted the suggestion that his motion be now
              considered as an amendment to the bill by way of substitute.

            Mr. STEIN, while professing to be a friend to the State University, opposed the
              substitute on the ground of impracticability. We are here, possibly, in the last week
              of our session, and it is of the highest importance that we proceed at once to the
              location of this College, for on the 4th day of July, 1872, our days of grace expire,
              and unless further time is provided by Congress the State becomes liable to the
              General  Government for this Agricultural College
              fund. Then he was not certain, under the act of Congress, that this fund can be
              amalgamated with the University at Bloomington. He read from the act of Congress, and
              said that wise heads in other States had construed it to mean the establishment of a
              separate and independent institution. He regarded the inducements offered by his
              county as infinitely greater than those offered either by Monroe or Marion county.

            Mr. HANNA replied, stating that he understood Mr. Purdue to expect this Agricultural
              College to be located south of the Tippecanoe river, on lands nearly adjoin-the city
              of Lafayette, and therefore the propositions from Tippecanoe county ought to be
              considered independent of each other. It will take all Mr. Purdue offers $15,000 a
              year for ten years to build, and at the end of ten years you don't have a
              building costing as much as the State Normal school building at Terre Haute. And it
              will be ten years before the building will be finished and all ready for occupancy by
              the College.

            Mr. ROBINSON, of Madison, maintained that we have no right under the act of Congress
              to connect this Agricultural College with any University. He advocated the passage of
              the bill under consideration.

            Mr. RICE favored the substitute, and spoke against the establishment of an
              independent Agricultural College; gentlemen have been defied to point out a successful
              institution of the kind in the new or old world; they don't live by themselves.
              He regarded it as a question of relieving the people of the State from the burden of
              taxation; and that was the main reason that would influence him to vote for the
              substitute.

            Mr. BELLAMY opposed the bill and substitute-speaking in favor of the location at
              Indianapolis in connection with the Northwestern Christian University.

            Mr. STEIN submitted a written guarantee that the $50,000 donation proposed by the
              Commissioners of Tippecanoe county should be paid as agreed, which guarantee was
              signed by H. W. Chase, Martin L. Pierce, John Purdue, Mr. Sample, Mr. Reynolds, Mr.
              Stein, himself and others. And on his motion the motion to recommit was laid on the
              table by yeas 27. nays 10 as follows:

            
              
                
                  YEAS-Messrs. Andrews, Armstrong, Beardsley, Bellamy,
                    Bradley, Carson, Case, Caven, Church, Eliott, Fosdick, Gifford, Gray, Green,
                    Hadley, Hamilton, Hess, Hooper, Jaquess, Kinley. Reynolds, Robinson of Madison,
                    Robinson of Decatur, Scott, Sherrod, Stein, Turner-27.

                  NAYS-Messrs. Bird, Cravens, Fisher, Hanna, Humphreys, Lee,
                    Montgomery, Morgan, Rice, Tagsart-10.
                
              
            

            Then came the recess till 2 o'clock. 

          
          

          
            AFTERNOON SESSION.

             Mr. SHERROD, by leave, offered th following concurrent resolution:

            Resolved, The House of Representatives concurring, the Senate will
              adjourn Monday, the 10th instant, without day.

            Mr. CRAVENS did not understand how the Senate could adjourn sine die when there was an order for the joint convention on the
              llth without rescinding that order.

            Mr. JOHNSON, of Montgomery, offend an amendment by way of substitute, as follows:

            WHEREAS, The Governor did by proclamation call the General
              Assembly of the State of Indiana to meet on the 8th day of April last for making the
              necessary appropriations for carrying on the State government and the institutions
              belonging to the State,

            AND WHEREAS, The bills making said
              appropriations have all been passed except the specific Appropriation Bill, and there
              being sufficient time for the passage of said bill before the time fixed by the
              resolution, for the adjournment be it, therefore,

            Resolved, That the Senate will, the House concurring, adjourn
                sine die on Monday, May 10 at 10
              o'clock A. M. '

            Mr. CRAVENS renewed his objection to the resolution. Inasmuch as the Senate has
              agreed to a special order after that time, would it not in effect rescind that order
              and bring us to action upon the constitutional amendment at once? He asked for
              information.

            On motion of Mr. CARSON the substitute was laid on the table.

            Mr. RICE desired Senators to carefully consider the question propounded by Mr.
              Cravens. He did not want Senators to set an order for a certain day, and then come in
              and set a previous day for final adjournment; and questioned whether it was a proper
              carrying out of the understanding between Senators at the time the special order was
              made.

            Mr. ROBINSON, of Madison, was willing to vote for the resolution now with the
              understanding that the constitutional amendment should come up at once.

            On motion of Mr. BELLAMY, the resolution was laid on the table by yeas, 30; nays,
              10.

            Mr. HANNA and others explained that they voted "aye" because they did not
              want to violate any faith or do any act having the semblance of committing wrong or
              breaking a pledge. 

          

          
            THE SOLDIERS' AND SEAMANS' HOME.

             Mr. HADLEY, from the special committee, submitted the following:

            
              
                
                  
                  
                    MR. PRESIDENT:-
                  

                   Your Committee, appointed to act with a similar committee of the House to
                    visit and examine the National Home for Disabled Soldiers, at Dayton, Ohio, have
                    proceeded to the discharge of their duties, and beg leave to submit the
                    following report thereon : 

                  We found the National Home most beauti 
                    fully and eligibly located three miles west of the city of Dayton, on a tract of
                    more than 500 acres of land. The Institution is yet in its infancy, having been
                    located but eighteen months ago, and is far from being complete in its parts,
                    but your Committee are unanimously of the opinion that its plan has been
                    conceived in wisdom and humanity, and when the design is fully executed, which
                    is rapidly progressing, it will want but few qualities essential to the
                    happiness and comfort of our disabled soldiers. There are three such Homes
                    provided by the Government - a second at Augusta, Maine, and a third at
                    Milwaukee, Wisconsin - of which the one at Dayton is by far the most important.
                    Our best information is that there are less than one hundred soldiers in each of
                    the Homes at Augusta and Milwaukee, while the names of more than eleven hundred
                    appear upon the rolls at Dayton. The three institutions are under one and the
                    same management, conducted upon the same principle, and out of the same fund,
                    are equally inviting in appearance, and any disabled volunteer soldier in the
                    United States in admissible into either. So it is hard to account for the
                    concentration at Dayton, if it is not in the fact of the superior mildness of
                    the climate.

                  These institutions are supported out of a fund accumulated from the fines and
                    forfeitures and unclaimed pay and bounty of soldiers, and there still remains,
                    as best ascertained, about five million dollars, which is being constantly
                    augmented.

                  The law creating these institutions, as strictly construed, would exclude from
                    their benefits all seamen and soldiers of the war of 1812 and 1846 and 1847, as
                    well as those enlisted into the regular army during the late war, but the
                    officers of the Home at Dayton construe the law with such generous liberality
                    that any worthy subject of either of these classes will be admitted into their
                    Home.

                  The government of the Home, at Dayton, in the opinion of your Committee, is as
                    mild as it is possible to be, to preserve order. Perfect liberty does not
                    prevail, but it is not more restricted than must be necessary to secure peace
                    and good behavior among so many men and so many natures.

                  In comparing our Knightstown Home with the Dayton Home, the one has not much to
                    loose or gain by the other. The Dayton Home is more comprehensive, and more
                    permanently located, and possesses many more short-lived attractions, reading
                    rooms &c., but it has the advantages of a restricted liberty and the
                    association of forty or fifty men, from different States, with incompatible
                    natures, in the same room. Liberty and companiable associates, two things which
                    enter so largely into making up a happy life, are prominent features in our
                    Knightstown Home. There are but from two to six soldiers in a room, all from the
                    same State, with a common interest, and a common pride, and these go where and
                    when they please, and return when they please. Conforming only, the while, to
                    the rules of the Institution.

                  There is room enough in either of the National Homes to accommodate all the
                    soldiers and seamen in our Home, but aside from all other questions, your
                    committee, after a careful examination, have reached the conclusion, that it is
                    not within the legitimate power of the Legislature to abolish "the
                    Soldiers'and Seamens' Home," at Knightstown. In 1865 and '66
                    a voluntary association of persons solicited, by contributions i'rom all
                    parts of the State, a fund of $15,000, out of which they purchased the
                    Knightstown property, except the improvements that have since been made by the
                    State, vesting the title to the same in James M. Bay, William Hannaman and
                    Conrad Baker, "in trust for the use and benefit of the Indiana
                    Soldiers' and Seamans' Home Association," until the Association
                    should be regularly incorporated. Then, on the 27th day of August, 1867, James
                    M. Bay, William Hannaman and Conrad Baker, in pursuance of said trust, conveyed
                    the property in feo to the Trustees of the Indiana Soldiers' and
                    Seaman's Home. From these facts it seems clearly in violation of the
                    Constitution for the Legislature to divert any trust or give it any direction,
                    or throw around it any restriction that was not intended by the grantors. While,
                    therefore, your Committee are of the opinion that the Home for Soldiers and
                    Seamen should not be abruptly abolished, , we do believe that by proper
                    encouragement from the officers of the Home, which we are assured will be
                    cheerfully rendered, this result will be practically attained, and we hereby
                    recommend the passage of a joint resolution instructing the officers of our Home
                    to use all mild and honorable, but voluntary means to influence the soldiers and
                    seamen-: to go into the National Home, that their places may be filled with
                    soldiers and seamen's orphans, now languishing in County Poor Houses. We
                    all agree that the Home for Orphans should be continued and encouraged. Most
                    States of the Union have recognized their obligation to take care of their
                    friendless orphans, and we think it would5 be to the interest and honor of the
                    State to extend a guardian care over all friendless children; but the orphans of
                    soldiers and-seamen, deserving a preferred protection and : sympathy, we
                    recommend that the benefits -of the Home be confined to them only, because we
                    believe it would be impolitic to burthen the State at this time in making
                    provision for all. This preferred class is as large as any we can accommodate at
                    Knightstown without additional buildings. The apartments now assigned them are
                    crowded to their utmost capacity, and there are eighty additional applications
                    now on file, twenty or thirty of which are from county asylums. But if the
                    building now occupied by the soldiers can be vacated, then one hundred and fifty
                    more children can be received, which it is thought will about meet the wants of
                    this class, "if, then, the Home for Orphans at Knightstown is to be
                    continued, there seems to arise an imperative necessity for making more liberal
                    provisions. Under existing laws but $1 50 per week for each inmate is allowed,
                       including subsistence, clothing, fuel,
                    school books, salaries of teachers and all other subordinate employes, and
                    repairs. And it is thought that the Institution can not possibly be conducted
                    another year upon this allowance. The State of Iowa is supporting 833
                    soldiers' orphans at an expense to the State of more than $80,000 per
                    annum. Pennsylvania is supporting and educating 3,431 soldiers' orphans, at
                    an expense to the State of $2 65 per week for each inmate. Michigan is taking
                    care of and educating her soldiers'orphans at an expense of $3 50 per week
                    for each inmate.

                  Your Committee, therefore, to secure an honorable and respectable support of
                    the Institution, as well as to empower the Trustees to indenture the children as
                    fast as good opportunities offer, would respectfully recommend the passage of
                    Senate bill. No. 240, which contains the necessary provisions.

                  
                    All of which is respectfully submitted.
                     JOHN V. HADLEY
                      A. Y. HOOFER CHARLES B. LASELLE
                  
                
              
            
          
          

          
            AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE.

             On motion of Mr. Stein the bill [S. 156]
              pending at the time of the recess for dinner, was ordered to be read the third thine
              now.

            Mr. RICE asked unanimous consent to insert a section that the State of Indiana shall
              never be called upon to make any appropriations for the erection of buildings, buying
              grounds or endowing professorships.

            Mr. STEIN objected.

            The bill was then read the third time.

            Mr. STEIN made an ineffectual demand for the previous question.

            Mr. CAVIN, referring to the act of Congress making this grant, recited the fact that
              no part of the principal can be used for the erection of buildings; and referring to
              the history of the consideration of this question by the Legislature, declared that
              the State owed a debt of gratitude to Marion county for having brought out and
              developed a strife for the location of the Agricultural College. He presented in their
              most favorable light the inducements and donations offered by Marion county, and
              assured Senators that if the location were made in connection with the Northwestern
              Christion University (as this bill provides) the State of Indiana never should
              contribute one dollar for the maintainance of the College, nor be called upon to pay
              one dollar of its liabilities.

            Mr. TURNER, believing it to he his duty as a representative of the people to vote
              for, and if possible locate the Agricultural College this session, decided in favor of
              Tippecanoe county-the proposition of the Hon. John Purdee being the only one before us
              which would hold good in law.

            Mr. HAMILTON also spoke in favor of the bill under consideration. He never would
              consent to vote in favor of locating this Agricultural College with a University
              controlled whooly, or in part, by any religious denomination.

            Mr. STEIN obtained the floor and proceeded to compare the offers from Tippecanoe and
              Marion counties, reflecting severely upon the manner in which the offer was made of
              $75,000, purporting to come from Marion county the other day. He characterized it as
              simply an offer from three men, who signed themselves Commissioners, made to hoodwink
              and deceive us. The records in the Recorder's office show no such order, and the
              Senator from Marion county admits that no such order was ever entered on the County
              Commissioners order book. When he had concluded, disclaiming any intention to encroach
              upon the rights of others, he demanded the previous question, but withheld it for
              -

            Mr. HANNA, who admitted that we were consuming too much of the time of the people in
              talking about this matter. He saw now but two alternatives presented, and if the
              Senate is to make the location at this session, he did not see how he could do better
              than to take a stand upon the proposition of an individual understood to be able to
              meet his contracts. For himself he would vote in favor of Tippecanoe county, if she
              had not proposed to donate one dollar, in preference to voting in favor of
              Indianapolis. He never would vote for the education of children in Marion county since
              he saw her citizens chuckling while a military officer was training his cannot upon a
              Democratic meeting in this city. If driven to choose between these two propositions he
              should vote for Tippecanoe county as a choice between two evils.

            Mr. STEIN renewed his demand for the previous question.

            The Senate seconded the demand, and under the operations of the previous question
              -

            The bill passed by yeas 32, nays 10, as follows:


            
              
                
                  YEAS-Messrs. Andrews, Armstrong, Beardsley, Bird, Bradley,
                    Carson, Case, Church, Cravens, Denbo, Fisher, Fosdick, Gifford, Gray, Hadley,
                    Hamilton, Hanna, Henderson, Hooper, Huey, Huffman, Johnston of Montgomery,
                    Montgomery, Rice, Reynolds, Robinson of Madison, Robinson of Decatur, Scott,
                    Sherrod, Stein, Taggart and Turner-32.

                  NAYS-Messrs. Bellamy, Caven, Eliott, Greet Hess, Humphreys,
                    Jaquess, Kinley, Lee and Morgan-10. 
                
              
            

          
          

          
            BILLS ON THE FINAL READING.

             On motion by Mr. CRAVENS, the Senate returned to the consideration of Senate bills
              on the third reading.

             Mr. Wood's bill [S. 189] to amend the 
              18th section of the Registry law, coming up in order, it was read the third time.

            Mr. BRADLEY objected to the bill on constitutional grounds.

            It failed to pass for want of a constitutional majority - yeas 22, nays 14.

            Mr. Robinson of Madison's bill [S. 202] to authorize railroad companies to sell,
              lease or otherwise dispose of their roads, etc., being read the second time -

            Mr. R. and Mr. CRAVENS explained that the bill authorizes leases; it supplies a
              defect in the laws.

            Mr. SCOTT would oppose any bill that put it into the power of any one man to give or
              withold his consent to any arrangement that would release any claims held by the State
              - especially where such claims would amount to half a million or a million of dollars.
              He could not determine, by the reading from the desk, whether the last clause in the
              bill is a safe one or not.

            On motion by Mr. ROBINSON, of Madison, by unanimous consent the proviso to the sixth
              section was stricken out. It contains the clause objected to by the Senator from Vigo
              [Mr. Scott].

            The bill passed by yeas 27, nays 9.

            Mr. Robinson of Madison's bill [S. 203] to amend the act of regulating and
              confirming the sale of railroads, &c., approved March 3, 1865, and extending the
              provisions of said act to all other railroad companies, being read the third time
              -

            Mr. SCOTT asked and obtained unanimous consent to strike out the words "or any
              other law of this State." As he understood the bill, it extends all powers
              posessed by every other railroad of the State, whether acting under special charters
              or under the general law.

            The bill passed by yeas 27, nays 8.Mr. Stein's bill [S. 253] to enable the
              several criminal courts in this State to try and determine suits upon forfeited
              recognizances, etc., being read for the third time - 

            Mr. STEIN explained that it was intended to give a jurisdiction to criminal courts
              that was sadly wanted.

            Mr. CARSON thought conferring civil jurisdiction upon criminal courts was a departure
              from the original idea which suggested the creation of these courts.

            Mr. BRADLEY also indicated his opposition to the bill.

            It passed by yeas 27, nays 10.

            And the Senate then adjourned. 

          
          
          
          
        
        

        
          HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.

          The House met at 9 o'clock, and being called to order -

          On motion of Mr. NEFF, Mr. Ratliff, of Grant, was called to the chair.

          On motion of Mr. STEWART, of Rush, the reading of the Journal of yesterday was
            dispensed with. 

          
            SAVINGS BANK BILL.

             The SPEAKER, pro tem., announced the
              consideration of the Savings Bank bill [S. 161]
              to provide for savings banks and for the safe and proper management of their affairs
              (which was made the special order for the hour) together with the amendments proposed
              thereto by the Committee on Banks the bill being on the third
              reading in the House of Representatives.

            The Committee's amendment to the 14th section and the 19th section having been
              concurred in by consent-

            Mr. CORY moved to reconsider the vote adopting the amendment to the 19th section,
              viz: adding to the seventh clause a provision that not more than $5,000 shall be
              loaned on the same security.

            After debate thereon, Mr. NEFF and others opposing the motion-

            Mr. CHITTENDEN moved to lay the motion to reconsider on the table.

            Mr. CORY demanded the yeas and nays, and they were ordered and taken, resulting yeas
              50, nays 21, so the motion was laid on the table, and the amendments were ordered to
              the engrossment.

            The bill was then read the third time, as amended. It provides that any number of
              voters not less than seven, nor more than twenty-one who shall each be the owner of
              unincumbered real estate worth at least $5,000, may form an association and organize a
              Savings Bank: with provisions for its management in many sections.

            The final vote thereon resulted-yeas 51, nays 23-as follows:

            
              
                
                  YEAS Messrs. Baker, Barnett, Beatty, Beeler, Bobo,
                    Breckinridge, Calvert, Chapman, Chittenden, Gory, Cotton, Davidson, Davis of
                    Elkhart, Fairchild, Field, of Lagrange, Fuller, Gilham, Gordon, Greene, Hall,
                    Higbee, Higgins, Hutson, Johnston, of Parke, Johnson, of Marshall, Lamborn,
                    McDonald, Millekan, Miller, Mitchell, Mock, Osborn, Overmeyer, Pierce, of
                    Porter, Ratliff, Ruddell, Sabin, Shoaff, Shoemaker, Sleeth, Stanton. Stephenson,
                    Stewart, of Ohio, Taber, Underwood, Vardeman, Williams, of Hamilton, Williams,
                    of St. Joseph, Williams, of Union, Zenor-51.

                  NAYS Messrs. Addison, Admire, Britton, Carnahan, Cave, Cox,
                    Dunn, Hutchins, Hyatt, Johnson, Long, McGregor, Miles, Montgomery, Neff, Palmer,
                    Smith, Sunman, Tebbs, Vater, Williams, of Knox - 23.
                
              
            

            So the bill passed the House of Representatives. 

          
          

          
            THE CALENDAR.

             On motion of Mr. STANTON the House took up the order of bills in the calendar on the
              third reading.

            Mr. Wildman's bill [H. R. 79] to provide for the erection and repair of bridges,
              was taken up.

            Mr. CHITTENDEN moved, ineffectually,  that the
              bill lie on the table till Mr. Wildman shall be in his place.

            The bill failed on the final vote-yeas 43, nays 30. 

          
          

          
            PROCEEDINGS IN THE WAYNE CRIMINAL COURT.

             On motion of Mr. UNDERWOOD, seconded by Mr. STANTON, the bill [S. 351] to legalize
              certain proceedings in the Wayne Criminal Circuit Court, was taken up (under a
              suspension of the order of business) and read the first time.

            Mr. UNDERWOOD then moved ineffectually to suspend the restriction-Mr. Coffroth
              raising a point of order against the motion-declaring also that there is no such
              pressing necessity for the immediate passage of the bill as that plead by the
              gentleman from Wayne: that criminals in the penitentiary may be released, if the
              proceedings of thirty-two days of Judge Johnson's Court which were not signed by
              him, on account of his sudden death, be not legalized.

            Mr. Shoemaker's bill [H. R. 313] prescribing the duties of county auditors in
              relation to cancelled city orders and the statements of property listed by appraisers
              and assessors, was taken up and finally passed yeas 68, nays 1.

            Mr. WILDMAN now asked for another vote on his bridge bill [H. R. 79] stating its
              provisions to authorize township trustees to construct bridges by appropriations out
              of the township fund and the bill was finally passed the House yeas 56, nays 15.

            Mr. BOWEN'S road bill [H. R. 120] to so amend the thirteenth section of the road
              law as to allow church-goers to pass gates tree of tolls on Sunday.

            Mr. UNDERWOOD. The only change it makes in the law is to allow persons going to, and
              returning from, public worship on the Sabbath to pass free of toll.

            Mr. CORY asked for unanimous consent to amend by adding a penalty of live dollars
              where a party may be convicted of falsely alleging that he is going to church, to
              avoid the tolls.

            Mr. WILLSON moved ineffectually to indefinitely postpone the bill. He then spoke
              against the proposed amendment.

            Mr. STEWART, of Rush, also gave considerations against the amendment. 

            Mr. STANTON, after submitting opposing considerations, moved to lay the bill and
              pending amendment on the table.

            The motion was agreed to-yeas 48, nays 25. 

          
          

          
            FOXES AND WILDCATS.

             Mr. Logan's fox and wildcat bill [H. R. 168] proposing a bounty of one dollar
              for each scalp, was taken up.

            Mr. OSBORN proposed to include "sheep killing dogs scalps"to refer the bill
              to the Committee on Rights and Privileges, with instructions to
              report that amendment.

            Mr. BRITTON gave considerations forth passage of the bill; it was desirable in the
              newly settled counties.

            Mr. SHOAFF opposed the amendment the bounty would be cheerfully paid in all the
              counties.

            Mr. WILLSON proposed to amend the amendment by striking out the words "sheet
              killing," but it was not submitted in writing and therefore not entertained.

            Mr. DAVIDSON submitted further considerations in favor of the bill, deprecating the
              amendments.

            Mr. STANTON demanded the previous question.

            Mr. WILLIAMS, of Knox, deprecated the hasty demand, and the amendments, as unworthy
              of the proper decorum of the House.

            Mr. STANTON responded, declaring himself a friend of the bill, and renewing the
              demand for the previous question There was a second for the demand, and, under its
              force, Mr. Osborn's motion to refer with instructions, to amend, was
              rejected-yeas 13, nays 65.

            The bill was then finally passed the House of Representatives-yeas 73, nays 5 Mr.
              Lamborn explaining and defending his negative vote by the consideration, that the
              hunters and hounds do more damage to his flocks than the wolves. 

          
          

          
            GERMAN IN THE COMMON SCHOOLS.

             On motion of Mr. COFFROTH, (under a suspension) the House took up the Senate
              amendment to his bill for German in the Common Schools-it adds the words,
              "physiology and history of the United States," and was concurred in.

            On motions of Mr. OSBORN, the Senate amendments to Mr. Ruddell's bill [H. R 341] creating the 25th judicial circuit,
              providing for the election of a judge thereof, etc., were taken up. They propose to
              make the bill to include the counties ot Morgan, Johnson, Brown, Bartholomew and
              Shelby, and prescribes the time of courts n the 4th Circuit, and to change the title
              accordingly.

            Mr. MITCHELL opposed the amendments, and insisted at length on the non-concurrence in
              the amendments-complaining of irregularity in the proceedings on this bill.

            Mr. WILSON replied, supporting the amendments from the consideration that, if the
              bill fail, Johnson county will be left without a court.

            Mr. OSBORN also replied to Mr. Mitchell.

            Mr. NEFF spoke in favor of concurrency in the Senate amendments as the best
              arrangement, leaving Morgan county in circuit where she has formerly stood.

            

            Mr. MONTGOMERY, thinking the Senate amendment will be satisfactory to Johnson county,
              demanded the previous question, and, under its operation, the amendments of the Senate
              were concurred in by the House.

            The House then took a recess till 2 o'clock.

          
          

          
            AFTERNOON SESSION.

             On motion of Mr. NEFF, Mr. Stewart of Hush, was called to the chair.

            On motion of Mr. CHAPMAN, (under a suspension of the special order,) the meandering
              land bill [S. 356], securing to the occupants and adjacent owners of unsurveyed lake
              lands the ownership thereof, and the committee amendments thereto were taken up the
              question being on the adoption of the amendments.

            Mr. COFFROTH set forth the provisions and the effect of the bill; it was simply
              declaring the rights of the occupants of such unclaimed lands, which he conceived they
              have under the existing law the common law.

            Mr. OSBORN was not entirely satisfied with the explanation. This land was, in many
              cases, reclaimed by the public draining process, it seemed to him to be a proposition
              to give the title to these lands to the adjacent owners, or the color of a title,
              whereas, he conceived that the title is in the Government of the United States. And we
              don't know whether it affects a few acres or thousands of acres, nor how much
              they may be worth. He understood that some of these unclaimed lands are very
              valuable.

            Mr. WILLSON suggested sundry difficulties which would be involved in the passage of
              this bill.

            Mr. RATLIFF replied to the objections suggested. Now, to prevent trespass, the
              occupants of these lands have to go to the United States District Court; this bill
              would enable them to find remedy in the State Courts.

            Mr. DAVIDSON considered that the bill is wrong. It would allow these adjacent owners
              to claim lands that belong to the General Government; it would give the adjacent
              owners color of title, not only to exclude the public from the cranberries, but even
              from fishing in the lakes.

            Mr. VATER regarded the bill as a proposition to authorize parties to steal the title
              to Government lands. When the General Government should regain their lands, these
              applicants should be entitled to come against the State for damages. It was repugnant
              to his sense of the high character ot the State of Indiana.

            Mrr COFFROTH discussed the rule of law governing in these cases of riperiant owners.
              He sent up, and caused to be read, a letter by the Hon. William Williams, a member of
              Congress for the North-eastern District, to Mr. Davis, the Representative for Elkhart
              county, relative to this matter: also, a paper stating the decision of the Supreme
              Court of the State of Illinois, as to the right of riperiant or shore owners to the
              adjacent bed of the lake, it being the same whether the title be in himself or in the
              State.

            He proceeded to answer the objections and dispel the difficulties suggested in the
              debate. When he had concluded-

            The amendments reported from the Special Committee were concurred in; and the
              question recurred on the engrossment of the bill. 

            Mr. WILLSON demanded the yeas and nays, and the vote resulted, yeas 36, nays 41; so
              the bill was rejected. 

          

          
            EIGHTH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT.

             The bill [S. 211] defining what counties shall constitute the Eighth Judicial
              Circuit, and fixing the time of holding court therein, was taken up as the special
              order. It affects the counties of Clinton, Boone, Fountain, Montgomery, Parke, Warren
              and Vermillion. The question being on the final passage of the bill-

            Mr. NEFF spoke at length against the bill, submitting specific objections, amongst
              which was the probability that the passage of the bill would lead to a division of the
              circuit in which he resided.

            Mr. GORDON stated the reasons for the bill to return two counties, Parke and
              Vermillion, to the Seventh District, where they belonged two years ago. Since the bill
              is acceptable to the people interested, there was no reason, which he could see, for
              the outside opposition to it evinced by the gentleman from Putnam.

            Mr. JOHNSON, of Parke, spoke in reply to Mr. Neff, alleging that the bill was desired
              by nine-tenths of the people of the counties of Parke and Vermillion.

            Mr. OSBORN spoke in favor of the bill.

            Mr. JOHNSON, of Montgomery, gave his views in opposition to the bill. It was giving
              an unequal amount of labor to the judge. He protested solemnly against its
              passage.

            Mr. GREEN demanded the previous question, and, under its operation, the bill sailed
              for a want of a constitutional majority - yeas 49, nays 30. 

          
          

          
            REFORMATORY FOR WOMEN.

             On motion of Mr. Stanton, the House took up the consideration of Mr. McDonald's
              motion to reconsider the vote of the House by which Mr. Stewart of Rush's
              Girls' Reformatory bill [H. R. 176], proposing an appropriation of $50,009 for a
              site, building, etc., was defeated. He urged the motion by various considerations,
                includ ing the moral, the humane and the
              economical. There was already a donatation by Mr. James M. Ray of grounds for a site
              for this Reformatory, near this city, which, with their present improvements were
              worth fourteen or fifteen thousand dollars. Mr. Stroughton Fletcher also has a part in
              this donation. He alleged that the $50,000 proposed by the bill would be all that
              would be required for the State to avail itself of the benefits of the proposed
              institution. He closed by presenting and asking for the reading of the memorial for
              the passage of this bill by the officers of the Association for the Relief of
              Friendless Women.

            [The memorial was printed in the Senate proceedings of yesterday.]

            Mr. VATER stated that the Ray donation to the city of Indianapolis, proposed to be
              given toward this object, is about two miles south of the city.

            The vote rejecting the bill was reconsidered, and the question recurred on the final
              passage thereof.

            Mr. MONROE (by leave) took the floor in favor of the bill, submitting considerations
              for its passage, which, he supposed, could not fail to commend themselves to the
              House.

            Mr. RATLIFF also submitted remarks which would explain the vote he intended to give
              for this bill.

            Mr. KERCHEVAL suggested a call of the House before a full vote shall be taken.

            Mr. BROWN spoke in favor of the passage of the bill.

            Mr. PIERCE, of Porter, proposed an amendment, which was adopted, adding appropriately
              a provision, "That no building shall be erected under this act, at the cost of
              the State, the total cost of which shall exceed the sum [$50,000] hereby
              appropriated."

            Mr. KERCHEVAL submitted a motion, which was adopted, that the Speaker invite Mrs.
              Sarah Smith, Manager of the Association for the Relief of the Friendless Women, now
              present in the Hall, to address the House on this matter; and that for this purpose
              she be invited to a place at the Speaker's table.

            This order having been carried out, and Mrs. Smith having delivered a brief address
              to admonish the House that the proposed reformatory is a question not of local, but of
              general interest, not demanded by the people of Indianapolis more than by the people
              of the State at large, the vote was taken on the final passage of the bill, resulting,
              yeas 62, nays 14, as follows:

            SWAMP LANDS DITCHING CLAIMS.

             On motion of Mr. COFFROTH the special order, viz: the bill [S. 270] providing for
              the payment of claims for ditching swamp lands out of the General Township Land Fund,
              etc., was taken up.

            Mr. COFFROTH said there was a fund in the hands of the Treasurer of State which can
              not be appropriated to any other purpose, and the bill proposed to authorize those
              claims to be paid out of that fund. He desired to put the bill upon its passage under
              a suspension of the restriction, after it shall have been read the second time.

            The bill was ordered to the second reading.

            Mr. WILLIAMS of Knox, desired to submit the following, which was read, for
              information:

            Resolved, (The Senate concurring). That the General Assembly will
              adjourn, sine die, on Monday, the 10th
              instant.

            On motion of Mr. OSBORN, Mr. W.'s motion for leave to offer the resolution, was
              laid on the table,-yeas, 41; nays, 32. 

          
          

          
            THE CALENDAR.

             On motion of Mr. RATLIFF, the House proceeded to the consideration of bills of the
              House on their third and last reading.

            Mr. Osborn's bill [H. R. 209], to define certain offences, and to prescribe
              punishment therefor, and to suppress usurpations of the functions of the Judiciary for
              the punishment of crimes, was taken up.

            Mr. OSBORN said the whole object of the bill was to suppress mobs pretending to take
              the power of Courts into their own hands, it having been suggested by the events which
              took place, not long ago, down here at Seymour.

            Mr. PIERCE, of Porter, and Mr. WILLIAMS, of Knox, taking exceptions to the bill 

          
          

          
            THE PURDUE UNIVERSITY.

             On motion of Mr. COFFROTH, the order of business was suspended, and the House took
              up the bill [S. 156] accepting the donations of
              John Perdue and others, and locating and naming the college contemplate by the act of
              Congress of July 2, 1862, adding a member to the Board of Trustees of the Indiana
              Agricultural College, and changing the corporate name of said Boar of Trustees.

            The bill having been read by the Clerk-

            

             On motion of Mr. COFFROTH, it was ordered to the second reading, and make the
              special order for to-morrow afternoon at 3 o'clock. 

          
          

          
            THE BENEVOLENT INSTITUTIONS.

             On motion of Mr. STANTON, the bill [S. 337]
              to make appropriations for certain purposes on certain conditions(to make Continuous
              appropriations for the benevolent institutions of the State, in cases of failure to
              pass the general bill) was taken up.

            Mr. STANTON said it is identical with the House bill of similar title.

            Mr. VATER proposed to amend by providing so as to remove all necessity for any
              sessions of the Legislature henceforth and forever, which was not entertained.

            The bill having been read the first time-

            On motion of Mr. STANTON, (the constitutional restriction being suspended for the
              purpose) the bill was considered on the second reading, and read by sections.

            Mr. WILLIAMS, of Knox, expressed some apprehension that it might repeal the Treasury
              law, or endanger the officers of the Treasury some way.

            Mr. COFFROTH and Mr. STANTON replied-the former stating the importance of action on
              the bill at once; for, as he thought, we shall have no more legislation after next
              Monday. That was his private opinion publicly expressed.

            After further remarks by Messrs. VATER and SHOAFF-

            The bill was finally passed the House of Representatives-yeas 61, nays 9.

            The House then adjourned. 

          
          
          
          
        
        

        
          IN SENATE.
          
             WEDNESDAY, May 5, 1869.
          

           The Senate met at 9 o'clock A. M.
          

           On motion by Mr. GIFFORD, the reading of the Secretary's minutes of yesterday was
            dispensed with. 

          
            REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.

             Mr. CAVIN, from a majority of the Judiciary Committee, returned
              the bill [H. R. 140] amending certain sections
              of the registry law, recommending the adoption of new matter therefor.

            Mr. HANNA presented a report on the same bill, from the same committee, declaring
              that the minority can not agree with the majority of the committee in recommending the
              adoption of the proposed substitute, and reciting constitutional objections
              thereto.

            On motion by Mr. ROBINSON the bill and the committee reports were laid on the the
              table and made the special order for tomorrow at 10 o'clock A.
                M.

            Mr. STEIN, from the Committee on Fees and Salaries, returned the
              county officers' fee bill [H. R. 78] without amendment.

            Mr. RICE knew the bill needed amendment. By its provisions the best office in his
              county, that of Treasurer, would get some $400 a year increase, while the
              Auditor's office-now scarcely self-sustaining-would be cut down some $700. He
              moved the reference of the bill to a special committee, with a view to amendment in
              that particular.

            Mr. GREEN and Mr. GRAY opposed the motion for the want of time-the latter desiring
              its consideration in the Senate.

            Mr. SCOTT favored the motion to refer. He thought none but men of experience in
              county offices could decide this question as it should be, and he hoped the committee
              would be composed of Senators who have been county officers.

            Mr. CARSON referred to the fact that county officers have not complied as a general
              thing, with the provisions of a law enacted in 1863 or '61, requiring them to
              make an annual report of the fees received by them, arid regarded that fact as an
              evidence that their fees and salaries were entirely too much; and he attributed to the
              latter fact a greater part of the corruptions of the ballot box.

            Mr. JOHNSON, of Spencer, desired the bill pressed to a vote. The people are clamorous
              for its passage, and he hoped its friends would stick close to it.

            Mr. JOHNSTON, of Montgomery, thought the bill had better be made a little more plain,
              and for that reason he favored the motion to recommit.

            Mr. HADLEY, if he understood the bill, declared it would carry poverty into the
              offices of ninety counties in the State in order to reduce the salaries of officers in
              about ten counties, and the result would be that incompetent persons would get
              into-these offices and county records would get into confusion.

            Mr. MORGAN understood the bill to be for the purpose of cutting off the stealings of
              county officers. We would do the State injustice to go home and leave this bill
              without action in such a way as to insure its passage. He feared to refer it to a
              committee would be to have it smothered at the instance of parties here, interested
              and watching for an opportunity to destroy it. From the labor bestowed upon it in the
              House he was inclined to think the bill is as perfect as it can be made under the
              circumstances surrounding us.

            Mr. BELLAMY said: This bill does not make a proper discrimination between small
              counties and large ones, while in the-bill already passed the Senate all that is
              necessary has been provided for. 

            

            Mr. HANNA wanted to know whether the legislation of this country is to be controlled
              by county officers. The bill passed by the Senate only declared how the fees should be
              disposed of; and now when a bill comes in here from the House fixing their salaries,
              we find the hotels and lobbies full of county officers, and see them bulging up here
              in the Senate. He opposed the motion to refer. This is a very important bill, designed
              to remedy a great and crying evil, and it should receive careful consideration.

            Mr. GRAY desired this bill to pass. The one passed by the Senate does not cure the
              defects of the law; and if this bill fails it may please the County officers, but it
              will not please the people. The fees charged by officers of the Court are different in
              almost every County of the 'State; which is a crying evil, and a load the
              Republican party can not carry.

            Mr. SCOTT undertook to say that this bill does riot remedy the evil of over charging
              by County officers.

            Mr. RICE said, this bill has merit in it, and he desired it perfected, because there
              are provisions in it winch are iniquitous and unjust. The fees of the officers in the
              counties of Parke and Vermillion were none too high now.

            Mr. DENBO would like to see the bill referred, for he thought it could be amended
              advantageously in many particulars. It will remedy some of the evils existing, but its
              provisions could be taken advantage of by officers disposed to. He indicated his
              intention to vote for the bill in its present shape, however, for he-regarded it as a
              deserving measure.

            Mr. HUMPHREYS for ten years was in and about a Clerk's office, and was satisfied
              that no bill can be passed that will do justice to all the counties in the State; and
              that the fees are not so enormous as complained of. A bill should be passed to cut otf
              constructive fees; but he was not sufficiently conversant with the provisions of this
              bill to know in what respect it should be amended, if it needs amending at all. No
              officer in any two counties are charging alike. He was favorable to the motion for a
              reference in order that the committee may carefully examine the provisions of this
              bill and suggest amendments if necessary.

            Mr. CARSON declared that it was these very specific fees going into the pockets of
              county officers that created so much trouble, and he favored the passage of this bill
              as the best thing that can be done.

            Mr. STEIN demanded the previous question, which was seconded by the Senate, and under
              the pressure thereof-

            The motion to refer the bill to a select committee was agreed to by yeas 23, nays
              19.

            Accordingly the Lieutenant Governor makes the committee to consist of Messrs. Rice,
              Bradley, Denbo, Elliott, and Case.

            Mr. ARMSTRONG, from a minority the special committee to which was referred the Court
              bill H. R. 11, presented a report objecting to the substitute for said bill reported
              yesterday by the majority of said committee, creating a new circuit - the
              Twenty-second Judicial- and recommending the adoption of a new bill, accompanying this
              report, in lieu of the bill H. R. 11.

            Mr. FISHER stated that the substitute reported by the majority was in accord with the
              wishes and views of all Senator interested except the Senator from Carroll [Mr.
              Armstrong]; and gave other reason why it should be adopted, and then he hoped the
              bill, as amended, would be passed.

            Mr. ARMSTRONG moved the adoption of the minority report instead of the substitute
              reported by the majority of the committee.

            Mr. HOOPER said the fact was that the substitute of the majority was to create a new
              circuit; and believing there was necessity for the creation of another new circuit, he
              hoped the minority report would be concurred in.

            Mr. FISHER said no man could perform the duties required of the Judge of the Eleventh
              Circuit; and thereupon argued that a new circuit was absolutely necessary.

            Mr. LASSALLE submitted considerations which influenced his support of the majority
              report. A new circuit was necessary or we must have a Criminal Court; and, as between
              the two, probably the former plan was the best.

            Mr. ARMSTRONG said the majority report proposed to disrupt the Court relations of a
              district that has been standing for twenty years or more; and he recited facts in the
              case to show that, most certainly, the business of the Court can be done under the
              report of the minority without the expense of creating a new circuit. He advocated the
              adoption of the minority report.

            Mr. BRADLEY favored the substitute reported by the majority of the Committee.

            The question being on the motion to substitute the report of minority- for the
              majority report

            The yeas and nays were demanded, an being ordered and taken resulted-yeas 26, nays
              7.

            No quorum voting-

            The Senate took a recess till 2 o'clock. 

          
          

          
            AFTERNOON SESSION.

             The motion pending at the recess for dinner was agreed to by yeas 32, nays 4.

            The minority substitute was then agreed to.

            

            On motion of Mr. FISHER, the bill [H. R. 11],
              as amended by the substitute proposed by the minority of the committee, was read the
              third time and passed the Senate by yeas 36, nays 2. 

          
            THE STATE UNIVERSITY.

             On motion of Mr. STEIN, Mr. Hughes' bill [S. 298], making an appropriation for
              the support of the State University $10,000 annually in addition to the appropriation
              heretofore made, was read the third time.

            Mr. CARSON thought we were going a little too fast-there may be no money in the
              treasury to meet it.

            Mr. STEIN recited the history of the bill in brief, and trusted that it would be
              passed a peace offering to our Bloomington friends, since they have lost the
              Agricultural College.

            The bill failed to pass by yeas 19, nays 21. 

          
          

          
            REFORMATORY PRISON.

             On motion of Mr. KINLEY, the Reformatory bill [H.
                R. 176] was taken up.

            The yeas and nays were twice taken in vain for a dispensation of the Constitutional
              provision so that the bill may be pressed to final passage-the last time lacking but
              one vote of the requisite two-thirds.

            On Mr. KINLEY'S motion the Senate took up the bill [S. 182] for the same
              purpose. He then moved to substitute the bill H. R.
                176 therefor-one being a transcript of the other.

            This motion was passed by without action, and-

            On motion by Mr. CRAVENS the female Reformatory Prison bill [H. R. 176] was read the first time.

            Mr. CRAVENS stating that Mrs. Sarah Smith, manager of the Association for the relief
              of friendless women, was present, on his motion she had leave to address the Senate on
              the subject-matter of the bill just read.

            This lady having made a few remarks from the President's desk-the Lieutenant
              Governor leaving the chair and taking a seat on the floor -

            On motion by Mr. KINLEY the constitutional restriction was dispensed with and the
              bill read the second time by title only.

            Mr. FISHER moved to strike out all alter the word "institution" in the
              ninth line of section 34.

            Mr. TURNER thought the amendment should be adopted, because should there be any
              deficiency future Legislatures would be sure to supply it. He favored the amendment
              because too much latitude was given by it to the Governor and the managers of this
              institution.

            Mr. FISHER believed that all appropriations of money should be limited, and that was
              the only reason which induced him to offer this amendment. He disliked the phrase
              "a sum sufficient."The amendment was rejected by yeas 20, nays 21.

            Mr. CRAVENS objected to the provision in the bill which allows a portion of the
              $50,000 appropriation to be used for the purchase of a building site, because it was
              understood that seven acres of land has already been offered for that purpose.

            Mr. HANNA objected to the provision that requires female children to be kept in this
              prison until they become 21 years of age.

            Mr. BRADLEY moved to strike out that clause-the 3d division of the 19th section.

            Mr. TURNER also saw many defects in the bill. This clause especially is manifestly
              unjust, and the motion to strike out should be agreed to.

            Mr. ROBINSON of Madison, did not think the amendment necessary, because the Board of
              Managers would not keep anybody there any longer than was advisable, and for the good
              of the party so retained in the institution.

            At the suggestion of Mr. Cravens Mr. Bradley modified this motion by inserting in
              lieu of the third subdivision of section 19, new matter.

            Mr. RICE thought this amendment would keep out of the institution many an honest poor
              girl because her character is not bad enough to gain admittance. He moved to amend by
              striking out "or" and inserting in lieu "and."

            Mr. CRAVENS called attention to the fact that the amendment does not yet obviate the
              objection raised by the Senator from Sullivan (Mr. Hanna). He opposed any form of
              slavery and would vote for no bill that authorized it.

            Mr. STEIN regarded it a fortunate circumstance that the bill was not passed with this
              obnoxious clause in it. The amendment proposes to act upon established facts, riot
              upon mere conjecture, and he hoped the amendment would be adopted.

            Mr. KINLEY was not disposed to interpose any serious objection to the amendment.

            Mr. HANNA could not consent to give the power to commit any one to prison because of
              poverty, or of fear that such person may fall into temptation.

            Mr. MORGAN was convinced that the bill was good enough without amendment.

            Mr. GRAY presented objections to the bill.

            The third subdivision of the nineteenth section was stricken out upon a division of
              the Senate-affirmative 21, negative not counted.

            Mr. BRADLEY withdrew his motion to insert new matter therefor. 

            

            Mr. FISHER moved to strike out "21" and insert "18," as the age
              when the inmates are to be discharged, wherever it occurs in the Reformatory
              Department.

            The motion was agreed to upon a division-affirmative 21, negative not counted.

            On motion by Mr. BRADLEY, the bill was read the third time.

            Mr. HANNA asked and obtained unanimous consent to strike out the clause giving
              criminal jurisdiction to the Board of Managers-the first four and a half lines of
              section 33, which was clearly unconstitutional.

            Mr. STEIN asked and obtained consent for an amendment declaring that commitments to
              the penal department shall be till the person is twenty-one years of age, and to the
              reformatory department till eighteen years of age.

            The bill then passed by yeas 34, nays 10.

            Mr. HADLEY moved to make the Soldiers' Home bill [S. 246] the special order for 9 1/2 o clock
              to-morrow morning.

            The motion was agreed to.

            And then the Senate adjourned. 

          
          
          
          
        
        

        
          HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.

          The House met at 9 o'clock A. M.

          On motion of Mr. UNDERWOOD, the reading of the journal of yesterday was dispensed with. 

          
            THE CRIMINAL COURTS FOR VANDERBURGH AND JEFFERSON.

             Mr. OVERMYER (by consent), from the committee of conference on the disagreeing'
              votes between the two Houses as to the Senate amendment to Mr. Welborn's bill
                [H. R. 90], for a bill for a Criminal Court
              for the county of Vanderburgh-the Senate amendment adding provisions for a Criminal
              Court for the county of Madison, to which the House non-concurred; reported, That the
              House recede from its non-concurrence.

            On motion of Mr. JOHNSTON, of Parke, the report was laid on the table-to await the
              return of Mr. Welborn. 

          
          

          
            REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.

             Mr. DUNN, from the Committee on the Judiciary, returned his court
              system revision bill [H. R. 389] with amendments appropriately inserting these words
              in the first section: "and of the Codes of Practice;" also, in section two,
              striking out "120 days," and inserting "150 days" in lieu.

            He then moved to suspend the order of business, and put the bill on its passage.

            Mr. MITCHELL demanded the yeas and nays thereon, and the motion was rejected-yeas 40,
              nays 44.

            Mr. COFFROTH, from the same Committee, returned the bill [S. 286] to amend the act to incorporate the
              Franklin Insurance Company, recommending its passage.

            Mr. SABIN, from the Committee on Claims, reported for allowance of
              the claims of Peter of Peter McCostar, the Daily Telegraph Company
              and Pierre Costar; which were concurred in.

            He also returned the resolution of the House for allowance of $35 each to the members
              of the Prison Committee, to cover extra expenses incurred by them
              in visiting the prisons, with a recommendation that they be allowed $10 each, which
              was concurred in.

            He also reported for allowance of $100 additional compensation for William B.
              Prather, for services as Clerk of the Morgan Raid Commission, which was concurred
              in-yeas 52, nays 28.

            On motion of Mr. FULLER, the House took up the claim of Mr. Samuel Beatty for $161 50
              expenses incurred by him in the Beatty-Peelle contest for the seat of Representative
              for the counties of Laporte and Starke.

            Mr. NEFF would put Mr. Peelle's claim in the same case.

            On motion of Mr. FULLER, Mr. Peelle's claim was taken up.

            Mr. CARY moved that the whole matter be indefinitely postponed.

            Messrs. WILLIAMS, of Knox, COFFROTH, and others alleged precedents for
              Attorney's fees.

            Mr. RATLIFF desired a division between the allowance of Attorneys fees and other
              expenses.

            Mr. MONROE reports, so as to $100.

            Mr. GORDON offered the amendment thinking that the actual expenses incurred should be
              paid, if anything. The matter of necessary costs should have preference to Attorneys
              fees.

            Mr. GREENE was opposed to paying Attorneys fee and costs. There were undoubted
              precedents for paying per diem and milage to contestants. That had been allowed to
              these gentlemen, and that was sufficient.

            Mr. FULLER demanded the previous question, and under its operation, Mr. Monroe's
              amendment was rejected-yeas 33, nays 48, and the question recurred on the motion to
              indefinitely postpone.

            And then the matter was indefinitely postponed.

            Mr. VATER, from the Committee on Millitary Affairs, returned his
              bill, [H. R. 338] for amending sections 4th, 13th, an 15th of the act of March 11,
              1867, authorizing the Soldiers' and Seamans' Home, and supplimentary
              thereto, with amendments, providing, "that not more than fifty days  service shall be allowed for any one Trustee;" and
              inserting: "with the consent of the parent or parents;" striking out section
              5, and these words in the title: "and supplemental thereto."

            Mr. GORDON submitted a resolution, (which was adopted,) for invitation to General
              M.S. Hascall to privilege within the bar of the House. 

          
          

          
            GRAVEL ROAD LAW.

             0n motion of Mr. FULLER. A special order, viz: Mr. Millikan's gravel road bill,
                [H. R. 50] and other bills on the same
              subject, originating in the two Houses of the General Assembly, were taken up.

            Mr. RUDDELL, (in behalf of the special committee thereon,) proposed an amendment by
              way of substitute, which he said is made up of Mr. Millikin's bill precisely,
              with such additions as have been suggested by the various proposed amendments, and the
              suggestions of gentlemen who have interested themselves in this gravel road
              question.

            The substitute amendment having been read by the Clerk-

            Mr. ODELL proposed to amend the sub-substitute by adding a section to this
              effect:

            Any such company shall have the right to enter upon land adjacent to their road and
              construct ditches and drains, doing no unnecessary damage, and shall have the right to
              take and appropriate timber and dirt, by giving the owner five days notice of their
              intention, etc.

            Mr. RUDDELL accepted the amendment.

            Mr. VATER proposed to amend the first section of the substitute by adding these
              words:

            "Provided, That after the assessment is made, the said company
              shall present to the road Commissioners the written consent of the property holders
              assessed in such assessment."

            He said by the present provisions of the bill money is put against men; the majority
              are thrown upon the mercy of the road company. The majority should have, the right to
              sayafter the survey, whether they want the road or not.

            Mr. RUDDELL opposed the amendment.

            Mr. GORDON supported it.

            Mr. HIGGINS moved to lay Mr. Vater's amendment on the table.

            Mr. VATER demanded the yeas and nays, which resulted-yeas, 41; nays, 43, and
              then-

            Mr. OSBORN proposed to substitute for Mr. Vater's amendment words to this
              effect:

            Add to the first section: Provided that after the assessments shall have been made,
              they shall be submitted to the parties so assessed, and if a majority of them shall
              approve, they shall be collected accordingly: and if the said majority shall not
              approve, then the said assessments shall not be collected.

            The SPEAKER said it would be in the third degree.

            Mr. RUDDELL submitted further considerations against the amendment.

            Mr. RATLIFF indicated a substitute for Mr. Vater's amendment by saying:
              "Upon petition of the owners of one-half of the real estate within a mile and a
              half of the road."

            Mr. STEWART, of Rush, was fearful that the bill would be loaded down too heavily with
              amendments. He could not see how the bill could be any better guarded for the
              protetion of the interests of minorities. It had been considered in committees-in
              large committees-the friends of the bill in all parts of the State had been invited to
              consider it, and it was supposed to be guarded in every point against all conceivable
              objections on the part of the friends of gravel roads all over the State.

            After further debate by Messrs. Ratliff, Shoaff, Stanton, Mitchell, Ruddell, Johnston
              of Parke, and others, the question as to the propriety of a property qualification for
              suffrage on a question of this kind-a road question, affecting the rights of all the
              people-all being in favor of a gravel road bill which shall serve the rights of the
              assessed, and at the same time encourage the spirit of public improvement; and all
              admitting the oppressiveness of the present law-

            Mr. STEPHENSON suggested that its friends vote this amendment down, and supply one
              that would not be objectionable. He demanded the previous question.

            Mr. WILLIAMS, of Marion, proposed a substitute for Mr. Vater's amendment which
              was read for information; to this effect:

            Amend section first so as to provide that the-party assessed shall be entitled to one
              vote for every $25 for which they are assessed, provided that each man assessed shall
              be entitled to at least one vote.

            Mr. GORY submitted the following, which was also read for information.

            Amend section one by adding this proviso. Provided, That in no case shall the County
              Commissioners order the assessment provided for in this section, unless a majority of
              the property owners within the prescribed limits shall petition therefor.

            The previous question was here seconded by the House and thereunder, the vote on Mr.
              Vater's amendment was rejected-yeas 32, nays 52-as follows:

            
              
                
                   YEAS-Messrs. Admire, Britton, Calvert, Carnahan, Cory,
                    Cotton, Davidson, Dittemore, Dunn, Fuller, Gordon, Hutchings, Hyatt, Johnson of
                    Montgomery, Johnson of Marshall, Long, McBride, McDonald, McGregor, Miles,
                    Mitchell, Monree, Neff, Osborn, Overmyer, Pierce of Vigo, Shoaff, Shoemaker,
                    Sleeth, Vater, Williams of Hamilton and Zenor-32.

                  NAYS-Messrs. Addison, Baker, Barnett, Barritt, Beatty,
                    Beeler, Cave. Chittenden, Coffroth, Cox, Davis of Elkhart, Fairchild, Field of
                      Lagrange, Furnas, Gilham, Greene, Hall,
                    Higbee, Higgins, Hutson, Johnson of Parke, Jump, Lawler, Lamborn, Logan, Mason,
                    McFadin, Millekan, Miller, Mock, Montgomery, Odell, Palmer, Fierce of Porter,
                    Ratliff, Buddell, Sabin, Smith, Stnnton, Stephenson, Stewart of Ohio, Stewart of
                    Rush, Sunman,Taber, Underwood, Vardeman, Wile, Wildman, Williams of Knox.
                    Williams of St. Joseph, Williams of Union, Wilson and Mr. Speaker-52.
                
              
            

            Mr. BAKER explaining, said, as the proposed bill repeals all Gravel Road laws, if
              this amendment prevails he would be compelled to vote against the bill.

            And then Mr. Ruddell's substitute was adopted by the following vote-yeas 72,
              nays 15.

            
              
                
                  YEAS-Messrs. Addison, Baker, Barnett, Beatty, Beeler, Bowen,
                    Chittenden, Coffroth, Cory, Cox, Davidson, Davis of Elkhart, Dittemore, Dunn,
                    Fairchild, Field of Lagrange, Fuller, Furnas, Gilham, Gordon, Greene, Hall,
                    Hamilton, Higbee, Higgins, Hutchings, Hutson, Hyatt, Johnson of Parke, Johnson
                    of Marshall, Jump, Lawler, Lamborn, Logan, Long, Mason, McBride, McDonald,
                    McFadin, Millekan, Miller, Mitchell, Mock, Montgomery, Odell, Overmyer, Palmer,
                    Pierce of Porter, Ratliff, Ruddell, Sabin, Shoemaker, Sleeth, Smith, Stanton,
                    Stephenson, Stewart of Ohio, Stewart of Rush, Taber, Tebbs, Underwood, Vardeman,
                    Vater, Wile, Wildman, Williams of Hamilton, Williams of Knox, Williams of St.
                    Joseph, Williams of Union, Wilson, Zenor, Zollars, and Mr. Speaker-72.

                  NAYS-Messrs. Admire, Barritt, Britton, Calvert, Carnahan,
                    Cave, Cotton, Johnson of Montgomery, McGregor, Miles, Monroe, Neff, Osborn,
                    Shoaff, and Sunman-15.
                
              
            

            Messrs. Coffroth, Cox, Dittemore and Mitchell explained their affirmative votes, as
              cast, not because they consider the bill the best that could be devised, but better
              than the existing road law.

            So the substitute, as reported by Mr. Ruddell, was adopted without amendment; and the
              question recurred on the engrossment of the bill as amended.

            Mr. CORY now moved to amend by adding the substance of his proposition, which had
              been read for information, as above given.

            On motion of Mr. STANTON, it was laid on the table-yeas 59, nays 28.

            Mr. OSBORN submitted an amendment to add a section, to declare that the provisions of
              the act shall not apply to land owners in cities and incorporated towns; and

            Mr. JOHNSTON, of Parke, proposed a section to save the vested rights of road
              companies from the effect of the repealing clause of this act; but, it being plead
              that these rights are covered by the bill, the propositions were cut off the previous
              question, demanded by Mr. CHITTENDEN; 80 the bill was ordered to be engrossed.

            And then the House took a recess till 2 o'clock. 

          
          

          
            AFTERNOON SESSION.

             The SPEAKER resumed at 2 o'clock P. M., and announced the
              special order, viz: the several bills of the house to repeal the liquor license law of
              1859.

            Mr. Vardeman's bill [H. R. 279] amend sections 3 and 4; and Mr. Chapman's
              bill [H.R. 288] amending sections 4 and 8 of the liquor law of 1859, were read by the
              clerk-the latter by unanimous consent, being considered first.

            Mr. COFFROTH proposed to indefinitely postpone Mr. Chapman's bill, which
              requires the applicant for license to have his petition signed by a majority of the
              legal voters of the township, ward, or election precinct.

            Mr. STEWART, of Rush, thought this the best bill before the House, because it takes
              this question out of the political field and places it in the hands of the people of
              the locality interested. He rehearsed tho provisions of the bill-the majority on the
              petition-the prohibition against selling to minors-and the making of the vender
              responsible for the acts of his employees. Mr. NEFF gave his reason for supporting the
              pending motion-the existing liquor law is as good as can be attained.

            Mr. CHAPMAN spoke generally to the question of the necessity for this order of
              legislation, as a power, a correcting and restraining influence upon society,
              supporting his affirmative conclusion by the number of petitions of the people in
              every quarter of the State asking for it at the hands of this General Assembly. He
              quoted from judges and statesmen to show the alarming prevalence of crime on account
              of the use of intoxicating beverages. And in view of these startling statistics, he
              urged upon the House the duty of intelligent and instant action for the more effectual
              restraint of the liquor traffic. He regarded the suppression of intoxication as an
              econominal question. And his view of the kind of legislation now required was
              prohibition, or the nearest approach to that which we can attain. If we can not get
              what we should have, let us have the best we can get. He commended the prohibitory law
              of 1855 embracing, search, seizure and confiscation, the credit of which he gave to
              the Democratic party. It worked well until it was Perkinsized, when it gave place to
              titf present law, furnished also by the Demo-Democratic party in 1859. And to this law
              he urged the application of the amendments embraced in his bill, which he recited at
              length, expecting, if it were to become a law, that it would operate as a prohibition
              of the traffic in one-half of the townships, wards and voting precincts in the
              State.

            Mr. BOWEN spoke against the motion, and specifically in favor of the several
              provisions of the bill-contrasting what would be its operation with the evil effects
              of the  existing law. He was especially favorable
              to the bill, because it would lead on wisely and gradually, to the ultimate
              prohibition of the traffic. He gave way, upon the suggestion of the special order for
              the consideration of the Senate's Agricultural College bill.

            Mr. COFFROTH demanded the previous question, but there was no second to the demand,
              whereupon, on his motion, the consideration of the Senate's Agricultural College
              bill was postponed till the present order shall be disposed of.

            Mr. BROWN then resumed his speech, urging numerous considerations for the passage of
              the bill, amongst which he emphasized and illustrated those of humanity and public
              economy, when he concluded.

            Mr. Coffroth's motion for indefinite postponement was rejected - yeas, 35; nays,
              55, and the question recurred on the order for engrossment.

            Mr. Wildman moved a suspension of the Constitutional restriction so as to admit of
              the bill being put upon its passage, which was agreed to - yeas, 76; nays 11.

            On motion of Mr. BAKER, a call of the House was ordered and proceeded.

            On motion of Mr. MITCHELL, it was ordered that the lobbies be cleared, the doors
              closed, and the absentees be summoned to the bar of the House.

            Mr. COTTON moved to reconsider the vote for this order.

            The motion was agreed to on a division - affirmative 43, negative 27; and then-

            On motion of Mr. UNDERWOOD, Mr. Mitchell's motion to clear the lobbies, etc.,
              was laid on the table.

            On motion of Mr. COFFROTH, all further proceedings under this call of the House were
              dispensed with.

            On motion of Mr. WILDMAN, Mr. Chapman's bill [H. R. 288] to amend sections 4 and
              8 of the act of March 5,1859, was considered as engrossed, and put upon the third and
              last reading; the first vote thereon resulting, yeas 50, nays 34, as follows:

            
              
                
                  YEAS - Mesrrs. Baker, Barnett, Beatty, Beeler, Bowen,
                    Britton, Breckinridge, Chapman, Chittenden, Davidson, Davis of Elkhart, Dunn,
                    Fairchild, Field of Lagrange, Gilham, Gordon, Green, Hall, Higbee, Higgins,

                    Joseph, Williams, of Union. - 50.

                  NAYS - Messrs. Admire, Barritt, Bates, Bobo, Calvert,
                    Carnahan, Cave, Coffroth, Cory, Cotton, Cox, Davis of Floyd, Dittemore, Fuller,
                    Hutchings, Johnson of Montgomery, Lawler, Long, McBridge, McDonald, McFadin,

                    Sunman, Wile, Williams of Knox, Wilson, Zenor, and Mr. Speaker. - 34.
                
              
            

            So the bill failed for want of a constitutional majority of 51.

            On motion of Mr. CHAPMAN, Mr. Coffroth's bill [H. R. 101] to rapeal the liquor
              law of 1859, and Mr. Vardeman's temperance bill [H. R. 279] for amending sections
              3 and 4 of the act of 1859, were taken up and indefinitely postponed.

            Mr. STEPHENSON submitted the following, which was read for information:

            Resolved, That we congratulate the city of Logansport on its
              felicitous choice of Mayor: and, as the post of Mayoress is vacant, we earnestly beg
              of the gentleman from Cass to fill the position by appointment without unnecessary
              delay; that without being unduly solicitous in this matter, this House is of the
              opinion that a Mayoress would materially lessen the duties of the Mayor's office,
              add sunshine, &c., to the life of the functionary in question.

            Resolved, 2d. That nothing herein shall be construed to have
              reference to the gentleman from Cass, Mr. McFadin, but to the lonely Mayor elect of
              Logansport. [Laughter.]

            Objection being made, it was not entertained.

            Mr. RUDDELL moved to take up the unfinished order for the consideration of Mr.
              Williams' gravel road bill [H. R. 50.]

            Mr. COFFROTH proposed to amend by substituting a motion for the consideration of the
              special order - the Senate's agricultural college bill [S. 156.]

             Mr. MITCHELL submitted the point, that the order for the consideration of the
              agricultural college bill should be considered now, without motion - the temperance
              bills having been disposed of.

            After debate by Mr. Ruddell, Mr. Gordon and others.

            The SPEAKER (Mr. Davis of Floyd in the Chair) decided that the whole matter will be
              decided by the House; whereupon

            Mr. COFFROTH'S motion prevailed. 

       
          
            PURDUE UNIVERSITY.

             The bill [S. 156] accepting certain donations
              from John Purdue and others, and locating and naming the college contemplated by the
              act of Congress, approved July 2, 1862; providing for its organization and management;
              adding a member to the Trustees of the Indiana Agricultural College, and changing the
              corporate name of said Trustees, and declaring an emergency, was taken up and read the
              second time.

            Mr. BUSKIRK proposed to amend by adding to the second section the following
              words:

            Provided that the Eaid college is hereby located upon the express condition, that the
              State of Indiana shall never appropriate anything for the purpose of endowing said
              college, or make any appropriation for the purpose of extending or improving the
              buildings thereof, or for any other purpose in connection with said college. That if
              the aforesaid donations of John Purdue and others, made for the benefit of the college
              aforesaid, are not secured in a legal manner to the Trustees of said college, within
              thirty days from the day of the location of said college, the said location shall be
              null and void.

            Mr. OSBORN moved that the proposed amendment be laid on the table.

            

            Mr. BUSKIRK, appealing ineffectually against the motion, said he hoped it would not
              prevail, and that the House would admit the propriety and necessity of some such
              amendment.

            The vote on Mr. Osborn's motion resulted-yeas 43, nays 41-as follows:

                    Lamborn, Mason, McFadin, Millekan, Miller, Mitchell, Mock, Neff, Odell, Osborn,

                    Underwood, Vardeman, Wile, Williams of Hamilton, and Wilson-43.

                  NAYS-Messrs. Admire, Barritt, Bates, Beeler, Calvert, Cave,

                    Long, McBride, McGregor, Miles, Monroe, Montgomery, Overmyer, Pierce of Vigo,
                    Ratliff, Ruddell, Shoemaker, Stanton, Stewart of Ohio, Sunman, Vater, Williams
                    of Knox, Williams of St. Joseph, Williams of Union, Zenor and Mr.
                    Speaker-41.
                
              
            

            Mr. COFFROTH moved that the bill be now ordered to the third reading, and made the
              special order for to morrow morning at half-past nine o'clock, and thereupon he
              demanded the previous question?

            Mr. BUSKIRK, (Mr. Davis of Floyd, in the Chair.) Before the demand is seconded he
              desired to submit the following amendment to the bill:

            Strike out "Purdue University," and insert "Indiana Agricultural
              College" in lieu.

            He insisted that until the demand for the previous question is seconded by the House,
              a motion to amend is in order.

            Mr. COFFROTH. The rules of the House would settle that.

            Mr. BUSKIRK made the point of order, that the gentleman can not make three or four
              motions at one time. There was the motion to order the bill to the third reading; then
              the motion to postpone its consideration, and then to make it the special order for
              to-morrow; and after that, there was a demand made for the previous question.

            The SPEAKER (Mr. Davis in the Chair) held, that after the demand for the previous
              question, the only question that can immediately follow is to ascertain whether there
              be a second to the demand. If there is any authority the other way, the Chair will
              willingly take back the ruling. As to the point made by the gentleman from Monroe (Mr.
              Buskirk), if it were an original question, the Chair would say that the gentleman from
              Huntington could not make these motions together at the same time. But the practice of
              the House has been different.

            After further debate, the above ruling being maintained, the demand for the previous
              question was seconded-affirmative vote was taken upon Mr. Coffroth's motion,
              resulting - yeas 58, nays 24.

            Mr. JOHNSTON, of Parke, explaining said he voted in the negative, because he desired
              some such provision in the bill as that proposed by Mr. Buskirt.

            Mr. MCFADIN, explaining, desired to urge the passage of the bill, to settle the vexed
              question of the location of the College, this being the first time in these five years
              that the General Assembly could come to the vote for a location.

            Mr. BUSKIRK, correcting the statement, said: Four years ago this institution was
              located at Bloomington by five majority, but by skillfull fillibustering it was
              defeated.

            Mr. PIERCE of Vigo voted aye, believing that this motion will not carry the bill
              beyond discussion on its merits to-morrow.

            Mr. RATLIFF voted no, regarding this as an unusual procedure, for the discussion had
              not reached the question of location, but it was desired simply to perfect the
              bill.

            Mr. BUSKIRK, when "Mr. Speaker" was called, said: I wish to explain my
              vote. I have not had an opportunity of discussing the amendment which I proposed, and
              for that reason, if for no other, I should vote No on this motion. I would like to
              have tested the sincerity of these gentlemen who stand up here in favor of this
              location is Tippecanoe county, to see if they meant what they said when they told the
              people of the State if they got this location, this college should never cost the
              State one dollar. But, sir, it might be seen by this manoevering, that they have not
              made their proposions in good faith, and it will be but two years when they will come
              back here for an appropriation of two or three hundred thousand dollars for this
              college.

            Mr. OSBORN interposed the point of order, that the gentleman can not debate on leave
              for an explanation.

            The SPEAKER. The gentleman will proceed in brief.

            Mr. BUSKIRK continued. He had expected interruption before this time. But in this
              proposition he saw that the State of Indiana is to be fleeced (as in the case of the
              Normal school) by appropriations for the purpose of keeping up this institution. And
              it was for the purpose of estopping this that he had proposed his amendment, and for
              the purpose of compelling these men to put their donations in legal shape so that the
              State may certainly have the benefit of them.

            So the bill was ordered to be engrossed and made the special order for to-morrow.

            On motion of Mr. RUDDELL, Mr. Milliken's Gravel Road bill [H. R. 50] was now taken up on the third and last
              reading, and finally passed the House - yeas 70, nays 9. 

            

            Mr. ODELL filed his motion to reconsider the vote by which Mr. Buskirt's
              amendment to the Purdue University bill was laid on the table.

            The House then adjourned. 

          
          
          
          
        
        

        
          IN SENATE
          
             THURSDAY, May 6, 1869.
          

          The Senate met at 9 o'clock A.M.

          The Secretary's journal of yesterday was being read, when-

          On motion of Mr. HADLEY, the further reading thereof was dispensed with.

          Mr. CARSON filed his motion to reconsider the vote of yesterday by which the Female
            Reformatory Prison bill [H. R. 176] passed the
            third and last reading in the Senate.

          Mr. JOHNSTON, of Montgomery, reported adversely to the claim of Dr. Wright for services
            rendered in the arrest of a murderer in Tippecanoe county.

          Mr. STEIN regarded this as a meritorious claim, and resisted the Committee's
            report.

          Mr. JOHNSTON, of Montgomery, insisted that the counties should pay such claims and not
            the State.

          Mr. STEIN took the contrary view.

          Mr. RICE offered a resolution which was adopted, directing the purchase of fifty-one
            copies of Wilson's Digest of Parliamentary Law, one for the President of the Senate
            and each Senator. 

          
            THE SOLDIERS' HOME.

             Mr. HOOPER offered the following:

            
              
                
                  Be it revolved by the Senate of Indiana (the House of
                    Representatives concurring therein), That the Trustees and officers of the
                    Soldiers' Home are hereby instructed and directed to transfer, at the
                    earliest practical time that it can be done, by voluntary consent of the
                    inmates, the soldiers and seamen now in the Home at Knightstown, to the National
                    Homes at Dayton, Ohio, or Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and as fast as transferred, to
                    fill their places by orphans of soldiers or seamen and that said Trustees shall
                    not admit any more soldiers or seamen in the Home at Knightstown, except in
                    extreme cases; and report to the Governor semi-annually the transfers made.
                
              
            

            The resolution was adopted.

            The Soldiers' Home bill [S. 240] was then taken up, it being the special order
              for this hour.

            Mr. HADLEY offered an amendment, which was adopted, designating the fund from which
              the appropriations shall be drawn, &c. He also spoke at length in favor of the
              bill; explaining that it proposes to increase the weekly allowance for each inmate of
              the Home from $1 50 to $2 50 per week, and to give power to the Trustees to indenture
              the children as fast as they find good homes for them. 

            Mr. SHERROD opposed the billion principle. He refrained from detailing the facts in
              connection with this Soldiers' Home coming from our disabled soldiers who have
              been inmates of that institution, because he did not want said facts to go to the
              public.

            Mr. HAMILTON spoke of the advantages enjoyed by the children of the Soldiers'
              Home over those sent to county penthouses, and he urged the passage of this bill.

            Mr. HANNA regarded it as bad policy to congregate children together and attempt, to
              raise them under such circumstances; and he objected to singling out a class of
              inhabitants and conferring upon that class special privileges above others.

            Mr. CHURCH did not want to perpetuate this thing, but to get rid of it as soon as we
              can. These children are there, and the institution is there; and the probabilities are
              that we will have to keep it up for two years to come. Believing Senators had talked
              all they wanted to about this matter, he demanded the previous question.

            The demand for the previous question was seconded by the Senate, and under its
              pressure the bill passed by yeas 30, nays 10.

            Mr. JOHNSON of Spencer, objecting to some of the provisions. But the clause directing
              the Manager to hunt up houses for these orphans determined his affirmative vote.

            Mr. MORGAN, explaining, knew not of a soldiers orphan from his county going to
              Knightstown - the county he represents taking care of its own. At this Home, on a
              recent visit, he saw many able to earn their own living, and as there are some people
              so fond of ease as not to provide for children of their own, it looks as though we
              were calling upon counties at a distance to provide for the orphans of the immediate
              vicinity of this institution. He believed his people were willing not only to support
              their own, but willing also to help support the orphans in tile counties near this
              Home, and should therefore vote "aye."

            Mr. TURNER, explaining, would never deny protection to the helpless; therefore he
              voted "aye," upon the ground that almost general consent has been given here
              by Senators that at no distant time this institution is to be closed, and be no longer
              a leech on the State.

            So the bill passed the Senate. 

          
          

          
            THE ELECTION LAW.

             The bill [H. R. 140] repealing certain
              sections of the registry law, being the special order for this hour, was taken up, and
              the amendments reported by a majority of the Committee on the
                Judiciary - making it obligatory upon the Inspector to number the ballots
              as he puts them in the ballot box, etc., were read.

            Mr. CAVIN offered amendments to the committee amendments, so as to make the  bill applicable to municipal elections; and they
              were agreed to.

            Mr. JAQUESS offered an amendment, which was adopted, prohibiting any person who has a
              bet on the result of the election from sitting on the Election Board.

            The amendments proposed by the majority of the committee were agreed to by yeas 20,
              nays 20.

            Mr. ARMSTRONG moved to amend by requiring the voter to give in his residence and
              where he last voted.

            On motion of Mr. SHERROD the amendment was laid on the table.

            On motion by Mr. ROBINSON, of Madison, the bill was ordered to be read the third
              time.

            Mr. RICE demanded the previous question. The demand was seconded by 28 Senators; and,
              thereupon-

            Under the operations of the previous question-

            The bill passed the Senate by yeas 26, nays 16-as follows:

            
              
                
                   YEAS-Messrs. Andrews, Armstrong, Beardsley, Bellamy, Case,
                    Caven, Church, Cravens, Eliott, Fisher, Fosdick, Gray, Green, Hadley, Hamilton,
                    Hess, Hooper, Jaquess, Johnson of Spencer, Kinley, Rice, Reynolds, Robinson of
                    Madison, Robinson of Decatur, Scott, and Wolcott-26.

                  NAYS-Messrs. Bird, Bradley, Carson, Denbo, Gifford,
                    Henderson, Huey, Humphreys, Johnson, of Montgomery, Laselle, Lee, Montgomery,
                    Morgan, Stein, Taggart and Turner-61.
                
              
            

            Mr. CARSON, explaining that he desired an amendment requiring every elected officer,
              previous to qualifying, to take an oath that he used no unlawful means to secure his
              office. The man who secures the illegal vote is the man that has acted unlawfully.

            Mr. LASSELLE, in explanation of his vote, said this bill was contradictory to the
              spirit of the Constitution, and ought not to be adopted.

            Mr. MORGAN, in explanation, remarked that he feared this bill would but open up new
              ways for fraud in elections, and consequently should vote against it.

            Mr. RICE, explaining his vote, said that when a citizen does not wish to let a
              neighbor know how he votes he should have that right. He desired an amendment, so that
              the ballot box should be sealed after the votes are counted, and not be opened again
              except it be necessary to expose fraud, and for that purpose alone. He voted
              "aye" for the purpose of moving a reconsideration.

            So the bill passed with an amendment of title.

            And then came the recess till two o'clock. 

          
          

          
            AFTERNOON SESSION.

             On motion by Mr. JOHNSON of Spencer, the bill [H.
                R. 53] to regulate the mileage of Sheriffs for conveying convicts the State
              prisons, was taken up.

            Mr. JOHNSON of Spencer moved suspend the Constitutional restriction th this bill may
              be passed now.

            The motion was agreed to and the bill was read by title only.

            Mr. FISHER said there were many imperfections in the bill, and he pointed out several
              of them.

            Mr. SCOTT moved to amend the bill by striking out "108" for Martin county,
              an; inserting "125" in lieu.

            Mr. HANNA hoped the bill would not be amended unless there is something important
              that should be changed, because business between the two Houses is in sue confusion
              that it would endanger the passage of the bill to have it sent back to the House with
              amendments. 

            The amendment was rejected.

            Mr. GREEN moved to amend by allowing Tipton 126 miles.

            Mr. JOHNSTON, of Montgomery, regarded the amendment so trifling that he moved to lay
              it on the table. The motion was agreed to.

            Mr. FISHER moved to amend by striking out "115" miles for Miami county and
              inserting "91" in lieu.

            On motion by Mr. JOHNSTON, of Montgomery, this amendment was also laid On the
              table.

            The bill was read the third time and failed to pass-yeas 23, nays 22-Several Senators
              stating that their negative votes were cast on account of the many imperfections in
              the bill-the omission of Decatur county, &c., &c.

            On motion by Mr. ROBINSON, of Decatur, the bill was committed to a special Committee,
              with instructions to correct errors; the vote ordering the bill to be read the third
              time, having been reconsidered on motion by Mr. Jaquess. 


          
            THE PUBLIC PRINTING.

             The special order-being the bill [S. 158] to provide for the public printing,
              &c., was called up by Mr. Hooper.

            The Committee amendment to section 7, providing that the Commissioners shall not be
              interested in any way in the public printing, was agreed to.

            Mr. HANNA thought this no time to raise prices. The bill increases the prices for
              composition from forty-five to sixty cents per thousand ems.

            Mr. HOOPER explained that the sixty cents included rule and figure as well as plain
              composition; which about equalized the price. He had a written proposition from one of
              the best printers in the city do the work, under this bill, for 10 per cent. less than
              the prices fixed therein. 

            

            FISHER stated the object of the Committee was to reduce the cost of the public
              printing, and at the same time leave a handsome profit to the State Printer.

            Mr. CHURCH regarded this bill as striking out in a new field that he did not
              understand, and consequently he should vote against the bill.

            Mr. HOOPER said the bill did not branch out in a new field. The only thing in this
              bill is that it regulates the prices to be paid for printing and binding. An important
              feature in the bill is the provision for a commission of two practical printers and a
              binder to examine and audit all work done. He believed all its provisions to be wise
              and that they would be of great benefit to the State.

            Mr. RICE could not see that the State would be making anything by the passage of this
              bill; and should vote against it on general principles.

            Mr. TURNER thought there was no economy in passing this bill and was inclined to vote
              against it. He referred to a bill for $145 for printing which came before the
                Finance Committee to which he objected on account of the big
              price charged, and on investigating it the committee cut it down to $100. He would
              willingly vote for a bill that would remedy the evils complained of or inaugurate a
              system of retrenchment in any matter, but could not see any advantage in that
              direction by the passage of this measure.

            Mr. GREEN demanded the previous question-and there being a second-

            Under the operations of the previous question-

            The bill failed for want of a constitutional majority-yeas 21, nays 20.

            On motion by Mr. STEIN, the House amendments to his Savings Bank bill [S. 161] were taken up and concurred in.

            Mr. STEIN moved to reconsider the vote by which the Female Reformatory Prison bill
                [H. R. 176] was passed yesterday. He desired
              to strike from the bill the clause retaining inmates in the penal department no longer
              than till they are 21 years of age the courts might sentence for a term extending
              beyond the time when the inmate would reach that age.

            Mr. FISHER opposed the motion. If that be an error needing correction, the next
              Legislature can change the bill in particular.

            The yeas and nays were demanded and ordered, but before the result was announced Mr.
              STEIN withdrew his motion.

            Mr. CARSON renewed it.

            Mr. ROBINSON, of Madison, moved to lay the motion to reconsider on the table.

            The latter motion was agreed to by yeas 23, nays 20. 

          
          

          
            COURT BILLS.

            Mr. Bellamy's bill [S. 308] to create the first Judicial Circuit was taken up,
              and he submitted a substitute therefor, which was adopted by unanimous consent.

            The bill was read the third time, and passed by yeas 33, nays 2.

            The Marshall county Circuit Court bill [H. R.
                205] was then taken up, and, on motion of Mr. BRADLEY, the bill was pressed to
              the final reading under a dispensation, and passed the Senate by yeas 38, nays 0.

            The Laporte and Marshall Common Pleas bill [H. R.
                225] was taken up, and, on motion by Mr. BRADLEY, it was also pressed to the
              third reading, and finally passed by yeas 36, nays 1.

            The bill [H. R. 334] amending the act creating
              Criminal Courts-validating those courts, etc. coming up, on motion by Mr. CAVIN, the
              constitutional restriction was dispensed with, and the bill was read by title.

            Mr. BELLAMY moved to amend so that the salaries of Judges and Prosecutors.; shall be
              paid by the Court Districts; $2,000 per annum for Judges, and $500 for Attorneys.

            Mr. MORGAN made an ineffectual motion to lay the amendment on the table.

            Mr. KINLEY regarded the amendment, as unfair.

            Mr. CARSON saw no reason why this amendment should be adopted. Crime is not local.
              And this system of local taxation is what is ruining the State.

            Mr. ROBINSON, of Madison, demanded the previous question, and it was seconded by
              twenty-two Senators.

            The amendment was agreed to by yeas 27, nays 3.

            Mr. FISHER explaining his negative vote by announcing his willingness to favor such a
              provision in a proper place. This being a bill legalizing these courts it was not a
              proper place for such an amendment.

            Mr. CAVIN offered an amendment which was adopted, striking out the preamble to the
              bill.

            The bill was passed by yeas 32, nays 3, with an amendment of title.

            A similar bill [S. 324] was laid on the table on motion of Mr. Fisher.

            The Sixth Judicial Circuit Court bill, [H. R. 203,] coming up-

            Mr. HANNA offered an amendment, which was adopted, changing the times or terms of the
              Courts in Clay and Putnam counties.

            On motion of Mr. HENDERSON the constitutional restriction was suspended, the bill
              pressed to the final reading and passed the Senate by, yeas 34, nays 1. 

          
          

          

          
            NEW PROPOSITIONS.

             Mr. ARMSTRONG, by leave, introduced a bill, [S. 352,] to fix the times of holding
              the Common Pleas Courts in the 15th Common Pleas District, It was read the first
              time.

            Mr. CARSON, by leave, introduced a bill, [S. 353] repealing all laws in relation to
              Criminal Circuit Courts in the State of Indiana, which was passed to the second
              reading.

            And then the Senate adjourned.

            CORRECTION.-The report from the Committee on Fees and
                Salaries, made in the Senate early yesterday morning, on the County
              officers' Fee bill [H. R. 78] is erroneously attributed to Mr. Stein. It was Mr.
              Green who presented the report. 

          
                
          
          
        
        

        
          HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.

           The House met at 9 o'clock A. M.

          On motion of Mr. RATLIFF, the reading of the journal was dispensed with. 

          
            MORGAN RAID CLAIMS.

            Mr. DAVIS, of Floyd, from the select (committee thereon, consisting of one from each
              Congressional District, returned Mr. Hatchings' bill [H. R. 119] making
              appropriations (amounting to $413,599 08) for relief of sufferers on account of the
              Morgan raid, and submitted a report in writing thereon, reciting the history of the
              events of said raid in the State, and the legislative action had in connection
              therewith, embracing the report of the commissioner ; appointed by the Governor to
              investigate said claims. The report recommends the allowance of said claims, believing
              that the State will be reimbursed by the General Government, and returns the bill with
              an amendment-a clause declaring an emergency.

            Mr. DAVIS moved for unanimous consent to take up the consideration of the bill.

            Mr. McFADIN urged the adoption of the motion, considering the nature of the
              claims-the sheer justice of them, and the favorable consideration of them by all who
              have investigated them, and the recommendation for their favorable consideration here
              by the Governor.

            Mr. STANTON, though not having signed the report, had no objection to the bill going
              to the second reading and engrossment. He dissented only from the opinion expressed in
              the report that the State would be remembered by the General Government. The House
              would of course do as it pleased. He offered no distinct opposition.

            Mr. DAVIS suggested that there was no question of concurrence on the reasoning of the
              report, but only on the amendment submitted.

            Mr. GORDON had not agreed to the report in Committee because he was opposed to the
              allowance. The amendment was concurred in, and the bill was made the special order for
              tomorrow at 2 1/2 o'clock. 

          
          

          
            PURDUE UNIVERSITY.

            On motion of Mr. BRECKINRIDGE the House now took up the special order, viz. the bill
                [S. 156] for the location, &c., of th
              Agricultural College, and changing the style thereof to that of the Purdue
              University.

            Mr. BUSKIRK stated that having done what he might for the location of the College
              with the Indiana University Bloomington, he would withdraw further opposition to this
              bill, and he requested that Mr. Odell's motion to reconsider the vote on his
              amendment be withdrawn.

            On motion of Mr. JOHNSTON of it was ordered that Mr. Odell's motion to
              reconsider the vote of yesterday, tabling Mr. Ratliff's amendment, be laid on th
              table.

            The bill [S. 156] was then passed the final
              reading in the House, without amendment yeas 76, nays 19 as follows:

            Mr. COFFROTH moved to reconsider the vote just taken and to lay that motion on the
              table.

            The latter motion was agreed to.

            Mr. McFADIN returned his acknowlegments to the supporters of this bill, and be
              mentioned with special satisfaction the withdrawal of the opposition of the gentleman
              from Monroe (Mr. Speaker Buskirk). He desired to make this mention because by the
              partialities of his fellow-citizens at home, electing to serve them in any way he
              would be obliged to leave his place in the House in a few days, and taking leave of
              the members, one and all, in the best feelings, he desired to tender to them the
              hospitalities of his city, whenever it might be convenient for them, or any of them,
              to visit Logansport. 

          
          

          
            THE OWEN CABINET.

            Mr. FURNAS, from the special committee appointed
              to investigate the geological mineralogical cabinet of the late Dr. David Dale Owen,
              with a view to the purchase of the same for the benefit of the State, reported, that
              the collection is complete, embracing about 84,000 specimens, etc., recommending the
              passage of the following:

            
              
                
                  Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate
                    concurring), That the Committee on Ways and Means be and are
                    hereby authorized to report appropriation of $20,000 for the purchase of the
                    geological and mineralogical cabinet of the late Dr. David Dale Owen, and
                    shipping the same to the city of Indianapolis.

                  Resolved, 2d. That the Governor is hereby authorized to
                    appoint a judicious person to act in conjunction with the State Geologist, who
                    together shall proceed to negotiate for said cabinet, and if the purchase can be
                    effected on such terms as that the whole collection can be delivered in
                    Indianapolis, in such building as the Governor may designate for that purpose,
                    for a sum not to exceed $20,000-the Geologist and such person so designated by
                    the Governor shall proceed to contract for said cabinet, and forthwith box and
                    ship the same to Indianapolis to the care of the Governor.

                  Resolved, 3d. That the collection so purchased shall be under
                    the immediate care and supervision of such person as the Governor may designate
                    for that purpose until further provided by law.
                
              
            

            After some explanations of the report submitted by Mr. Breckinridge and Mr.
              Carnahan-

            The resolutions were adopted. 

          
          

          
            RAILROAD AID BY COUNTIES AND TOWNSHIPS.

            The bill [S. 215] giving counties and
              townships the right to issue bonds and subscribe for the stock of railroads was taken
              up it being the special order for this hour.

            On motion of Mr. FULLER (under a suspension of the constitutional restriction for the
              purpose), the bill was twice read.

            Mr. WELBORN recited and defended its provisions, and submitted a plea for its
              passage. It restricts the power of county and township taxation for this purpose to
              two per cent, in any one year, and to one per cent. at any one time.

            Mr. MITCHELL demanded the previous question, and under its pressure the bill was
              finally passed the House of Representatives without amendment yeas 68, nays 17. 

          
          

          
            THE CALENDAR.

            Mr. Osborn's bill [H. R. 209] to define certain offences therein mentioned, and
              prescribing punishment therefore, and to suppress the usurpations of the functions of
              the judiciary in the punishment of real or pretended offences (making its infraction
              punishable with imprisonment of not more than 14 years), was taken up.

            Mr. WILLIAMS, of Knox, proposed a clerical amendment which was adopted by unanimous
              consent.

            Mr. OSBORN proposed (and obtained unanimous consent) to amend by filling a blank,
              authorizing the Governor to offer detection rewards in any sum not exceeding
              $1,000.

            And so the bill was finally passed the House-yeas 65, nays 11. 

          
          

          
            THE CHAPMAN LIQUOR BILL.

            Mr. CHAPMAN (under a question of privilege) called up his bill [H. R. 288] to amend
              sections four and eight of the Liquor License law of March 5, 1859, which failed
              yesterday for lack of a Constitutional majority, and thereupon he demanded a call of
              the House, which resulted in 90 members answering; and then further proceedings
              thereunder were dispensed with.

            The bill was then finally passed the House-yeas 57, nays 36-as follows:

            Mr. KERCHEVAL explaining, said, in this morning's Sentinel Mr.
              Stanton and himself were charged with having dodged, vanished or bolted to avoid the
              vote on this bill; to which he replied that he neither vanished, dodged or bolted, but
              now voted for the bill for the same reason that certain Democratic members here bolted
              last March-to give, this question to the people. 

          
          

          
            TAX SALE LEINS.

            On motion of Mr. SHOEMAKER his bill [H. R. 136] to create a lein on real estate sold
              for taxes by the County Treasurer, in favor of the purchaser thereof, for all
              subsequent taxes paid-the same having before failed for want of a constitutional
              majority-was taken up and put again upon upon its passage. The bill was finally passed
              the House-yeas 73, nays 9. 

          
          

          
            SHERIFF TITLE TO REAL ESTATE.

            Mr. Willson's bill [H. R. 80] declaring what evidence shall be sufficient
                prima facie to establish title to real
              estate under a sheriff sale on execution; and providing, etc., was taken up on the
              third reading.

            Mr. WILLSON explained its provisions the record of judgment and sheriff's deed
              to be sufficient, without record of the 
              complaint. He regarded it as a very important bill in its bearing upon the title to
              real estate.

            Mr. GORDON suggested objections to which Mr. Willson replied.

            The bill was then finally passed the House-yeas 49, nays 13. 

          
          

          
            REVISION OF THE COURT SYSTEM AND ITS CODE.

            On motion of Mr. DUNN the House took up the consideration of his bill [H. R. 389] for
              a Commission (of three men) to revise the Judicial system of the State, with the
              amendments reported from the Committee on the Judiciary.

            Mr. DUNN said the amendments propose to include the revision of the Code of Practice,
              as well as the revision of the Court system, in the duties, of the Commission, and to
              extend the term of their sessions from 120 to 150 days.

            Mr. DAVIS of Floyd, felt himself authorized to say that this bill will be a fair
              commission-that the men to serve upon it will be selected with reference to their
              fitess to do this work as it ought to be done one of the gentlemen that will be
              appointed on this commission, (if the bill pass) he was authorized to say, would be of
              the Democratic persuasion. And he desired to state his belief that more money would be
              saved to the State by this commission, m this one item, than by any other bill of the
              session.

            Mr. DUNN spoke at length for the passage of the bill, disclaiming the surmise of
              some, that he had brought forward this proposition with the purpose or hope of
              securing a place for himself on the proposed committee. He had offered this bill,
              because an experience of four years at the bar had taught him, that our State
              Courts-our whole justicial system-is but a farce-a burlesque. Under its present
              operations men might be seen sent to the Penitentiary for years for stealing a sheep
              skin, while murderres go abroad as free as the most honest citizen; and there was no
              justice in an Indiana court where a man can come into it with money enough to buy a
              verdict. Affidavits for continuance must be taken by the judge, although he may know
              they are false; and under your justice, murder is made a bailable offense. He
              submitted these and other similar considerations as demanding a revision of the
              Judicial System and of the Code of Practice and Procedure. He stated in conclusion,
              that he offered this bill, not as a remedy, but as an experiment; and he would have
              the men who are to serve on this commission selected for their intelligence,
              capability and honesty, and not with respect to their politics or standing in that
              connection.

            Mr. McFADIN spoke against the passage of the bill. It proposed an expensive
              commission to sit one hundred and fifty days, to do the work of the Standing Comittee
              here on the organization of courts which work that Committee could perform any time in
              one week. When he had concluded-

            Mr. STEWART of Rush obtaind leave to record his vote in the affirmative on the final
              passage of the Chapman Temperance bill, and on the passage of the gravel road
              bill.

            The House then took the recess till two o'clock. 

          
          

          
            AFTERNOON SESSION.

            The SPEAKER resumed at 2 o'clock and announced the consideration of Mr
              Dunns' judicial commission bill [H. R. 389]the question being on the engrossment
              and final passage thereof.

            Mr. COTTON proposed to amend, by striking out and inserting a clause allowing the
              commission to sit one hundred days in stead of one hundred and fifty days, which was
              adopted by consent.

            Mr. DAVIS, of Floyd, took the floor and spoke briefly for the passage of the bill,
              and by way of reply to the objections submitted.

            Mr. VATER proposed to amend by inserting a provision requiring that one of these
              commissioners shall not be a lawyer, which was laid on the table.

            Mr. WILLSON spoke of the difficulties in which the judicial system of the State is
              involved, as calling loudly for the work of this commission.

            Mr. JOHNSTON, of Parke, demanded the previous question, and under its pressure the
              bill (being considered as engrossed,and having been read the third time as amended)
              was finally passed the House of Representatives-yeas 51, nays 30, with an amendment to
              the title so as to include the words, "and the Code of Practice." 

            
            THE CALENDAR.

            Mr. Johnston, of Parke's, bill [H. R. 234] declaratory of the meaning of
              sections 14 and 16 of the Landlord's and Tenants act of March 20, 1852, and to
              authorize and give a right of action by one joint tenant, tenant in common or tenant
              in coparcenary, and to recover rents for use and occupation of land for such tenant in
              possession, etc., coming up-

            Mr. JOHNSTON explained that it provides where two persons own land jointly, and one
              has sole control and use, he shall be responsible to the other for his share of the
              profits. 

            The bill was finally passed the House-yeas 65, nays 14.

            Mr. Vater's bill [H. R. 219] to amend the 
              bank shares tax act of March 5, 1867, so as make such shares taxable for municipal
              purposes, was taken up and laid on the table as matter superceded by the passage of a
              Senate bill. 

          
          

          
            LAFAYETTE INSURANCE COMPANY.

            Mr. Breckinridge's bill [H. R. 145] to amend sections 1, 6 and 9 of the charter
              of the Lafayette Insurance Company, was taken up arid finally passed the House -yeas
              73, nays 6-Mr. Breckinridge explaining that it merely provides for extending the time
              of the charter, for raising the capital stock to $200,000extending to them the same
              privileges heretofore granted the New Albany and Evansville Insurance Companies, which
              were organized under the same act. 

          
          

          
            INDIANA BATTLE FLAGS.

            Mr. Neff's bill [H. R. 268] for the preservation of Indiana battle flags,
              military trophies and relics, was taken up and finally passed the House-yeas 61, nays
              30. 

          
          

          
            DIRECTOR F. M. MEREDITH.

            On motion of Mr. RUDDELL, the House took up the special order, viz: the consideration
              of the report of the special joint committee, appointed to investigate the Southern
              Prison, and especially Mr. McBride's joint resolution [H. R. No. 16] for the
              removal by address of the General Assembly of F. M. Meredith, from the office of
              Director of the State Prison South(he having resigned that position.)

            Mr. RUDDELL complained of the effort in the House to embarrass proceedings in
              connection with this report, the committee felt that they had before them the single
              duty to present the facts as they found them in the management of the Southern prison.
              They were surprised to find the House reluctant to act upon their report, and still
              further were they surprised to hear their motives and their acts impugned. He
              proceeded to review the testimony which [hey gathered and recorded touching alleged
              corruptions on the part of F. M. Meredith in the management of the prison south;
              setting forth facts and circumstances corroborating the testimony of the witness
              Merriwether" against the said Meredith: his receiving money for retaining prison
              official J.B. Merriwether, and his corrupt "connection with the prisoner
              Matthews, serving as an attorney for money to procure a pardon for Matthews. He
              reflected so upon Meredith's agency in obstructing material portions of the
              testimony that should have been printed in the report. 

            Mr. JOHNSTON of Parke, took the floor, the and objected at length to the credibility
              of the witness Merriwether, as unfit to be used in this prosecution of Meredith. When
              he had concluded-

            Mr. VATER demanded the previous question, but there was no second to the demand.

            Mr. RUDDELL now presented copies of certain letters of Meredith, Commons and the
              Governor with regard to Meredith's application for the pardon of Matthews.

            Mr. PIERCE of Vigo spoke as a neighbor and friend of Mr. Meredith, to whose character
              no stain like this has ever attached before. He looked at the testimony and the course
              pursued in this prosecution, and manner of it, which forced upon his mind the-
              conclusion that there is an undue exhibition of personal feeling in this prosecution.
              He impeached the testimony relied on in the report, and suggested the
              unwarrantablenesss of the conclusions derived therefrom. When he had concluded

            Mr. WILLIAMS, of Knox. proposed to amend the joint resolution by adding the
              following:

            And to authorize the Attorney General to commence suit against all parties connected
              with said prison who may have been guilty of fraud against the State, if, in his
              opinion, the evidence is sufficient to convict.

            Mr. COFFROTH made the point that this proposition can not be germane to a joint
              resolution for removal of an officer by address, which it required a majority of
              two-thirds to pass.

            The SPEAKER sustained the point, and the proposition was ruled out of order. 

            Mr. CORY suggested that it was a little singular that this special committee,
              composed of 5 Republicans and 3 Democrats, should get up a groundless charge of
              corruption against a Republican official, of whose previous character the committee
              were wholly uninformed. And he proceeded to set forth the straitforwardness of their
              proceedings and the justness of their conclusions, in a careful review of the
              testimony, the printed as well as the suppressed.

            Mr. LAMBORN followed in a general speech, justifying the report of the committee, and
              supporting the passage of the joint resoluiton; from his knowledge of the confusion
              and self-stultification of Director F. M. Meredith before the Governor. When he had
              concluded-

            Mr. OVERMYER demanded the previous quastion, and under its pressure the joint
              resolution was passed the third and last reading in the House-yeas, 79; nays
              7-two-thirds voting in the affirmative.

            The House then adjourned. 

          
          

          

            AN ACT to enable incorporated towns to lay out, open, grade and improve streets and
              alleys and make public improvements therein,and to make surveys and adopt plats whepe
              the same have been lost or destroyed, and prescribing the du ties of the Board of Trustees, and providing for the mode
              of working and improving streets and alleys, and declaring an emergency.

            SECTION 1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of
                the State of Indiana, That the Board of Trustees of incorporated towns of this
              State shall have exclusive power over the streets, alleys, highways and bridges within
              the corporate limits of such town, and may prescribe the hight and manner of
              construction of all such bridges, and lay out, survey and open new streets and alleys
              and straighten, narrow, widen, grade and gravel and otherwise alter and improve those
              already laid out, or that may be hereafter laid out, and make repairs thereto as
              hereinafter provided. They may cause buildings, structures and other things in the way
              of any streets or other public improvement to be taken down, removed and appropriated
              upon the payment of damages, as hereinafter provided; and no person residing in said
              town shall be compelled to work on any road or highway without the corporate limits of
              said town, and the Board of Trustees may exercise all the powers given to Township
              Trustees in regard to highways in their respective towns, and the Marshal, under
              direction of the Board of Trustees, may perform all the duties and exercise all the
              powers of Road Supervisors in reference to a road labor tax, not to exceed two days in
              each year by each person liable to work on roads in townships, and shall be governed

              of $1 50 per diem, provided that the Board of Trustees may, by general ordinance,
              prescribe the time within which and the manner in which such labor shall be
              performed.

            SEC. 2. When, upon petition signed by twelve free holders,
              residents of any town, the Board of Trustees of such town may be of the opinion that
              public convenience requires the opening of a new street or alley, or widening or
              narrowing of a street or alley already opened, the Board of Trustees shall appoint
              three commissioners, residents of said town, who shall be disinterested free holders,
              to appraise and assess the damages and benefits accruing to the owner of any land or
              lot through which any street or alley is proposed to be constructed, or any building
              or structure thereon appropriated as provided in the preceding section, such
              commissioners shall, before they proceed to perform their duties as appraisers, take
              and subscribe an oath or affirmation faithfully to perform their dutes as such
              appraisers, which shall be endorsed or attached to their appointment and filed with
              the Clerk of the Board. Twenty days notice shall be given such commissioners by the
              Board of Trustees, through the town clerk, of the appraisement to be made, giving a
              complete description of the premises to be viewed. A like notice shall be given by
              personal service or by leaving the same with some person of suitable age at their
              reputed place of abode, to each of the owners or agents thereof, of lots or lands upon
              or through which the public improvement or street or alley is proposed to be made. If
              the owners are unknown or non-residents, publication of the same in one ar more
              newspapers of the town or by posting up written notices in six public places in the
              town, if there be no newspaper published therein, for three weeks, shall be deemed
              equivalent to such personal service.

            SEC. 3. Such Commissioners, or a majority of them, shall, at the
              place and time indicated in such notice, proceed to an examination of the real estate
              proposed to be appropriated as aforesaid,and shall then and there estimate : First.
              The value of the land or other property to be appropriated for such improvement.
              Second. What real estate, if any, would be benefitted by the improvement, specifying
              the same in parcels, with the name of the owner, if known, and the proportion of
              benefits each named receives, and the proportion of damages each would sustain.They
              shall view the premises and receive a evidence touching the question before them, and
              may, for that purpose, administer oaths to witnesses examined in relation thereto.
              They shall report on each of the specifications above indicated, and within ten days
              thereafter file the same with the Clerk of the Board of Trustees.

            SEC. 4. When such report is filed, as in the preceding section
              required, the Board of Trustees, if it accept the terms of the same, shall direct the
              Treasurer of the town to tender the owner or owners of such real estate, or their
              heirs or representatives, the damages awarded by such Commissioners, deducting the
              amount of benefits assessed to such owner or owners, or if not found within the town,
              or the award is not accepted, then the sum shall be kept by the Treasurer as a special
              deposit, subject to the order of such owner or his heirs or representatives.

            SEC. 5. If the Board of Trustees, within twenty days after the
              filing of said report, by a vote of a majority of the members, determine to make the
              appropriation of real estate for such improvement, it shall cause an assessment list
              to be made by transcribing so much of the report as aforesaid as describes the parcels
              of real estate to be benefitted by the opening or improvement, with the name of the
              owner, if known, and the amount of benefit which each would receive, thereby directing
              such amount to be assessed upon such parcels of real estate respectively, which
              assessment shall be a lien on such real estate. The Board of Trustees may immediately
              after making such assessment, by suit in any court of competent jurisdiction in the
              name of such corporation, recover against the owner of such parcels of real estate the
              amount of such assessment, and upon execution against the property of said defendant
              upon such judgement, the same shall be sold for cash without regard to valuation or
              appraisement laws of this State.

            SEC. 6. The Board of Trustees shall, within twenty days from the
              filing of said report, either accept or reject the terms of the same, and any owner of
              land or representative thereof, aggrieved by such report, may appeal therefrom at any
              time within thirty days after the filing thereof, to any Court having jurisdiction of
              the same, upon filing the usual bond with the Clerk of said town for the payment of
              cost; but no such appeal shall prevent any such town from proceeding with said
              appropriation and improvement as if no appeal had been taken. No other question shall
              be determined than the regularity of the proceeding in the suit, and the amount of
              damages sustained.

            SEC. 7. When the owner of any such land or building appropriate as
              aforesaid shall be an infant or of unsound mind, no proceeding shall be had affecting
              the rights of such persons until a guardian therefor shall be appointed by the Court
              having probate jurisdiction, and such guardian shall have given security to the
              satisfaction of such Court for the faithful performance of the trust, but any
              proceeding affecting such rights shall only be void to that extent.

            SEC. 8. Whenever a majority of all the resident owners of any lots
              or parcels of land or any street or alley not less than one square, to be estimated by
              numbers or by measuring the front lines of such lots or parcels of land bordering
              thereon, shall petition the Board of Trustees of such town to grade, pave, gravel or
              macadamize, or for either kind of said improvements, the Board of Trustees may cause
              the same to be done according to the specifications by them to be adopted by contracts
              given to the best bidder after advertising to receive proposal therefor: Provided, That the said Board of Trustees may order the improvement as
              aforesaid of any street around the public square in such town without the filing of
              such petition, and when the county in which such town is situate owns or controls real
              estate bordering on such public square, it shall be subject to the same rules and
              regulations as to payment for said improvements as the citizens of said town are
              subjected.

            SEC. 9. In all contracts specified in the last  preceding section the cost of any such improvement shall
              be estimated according to the whole length of such street alley, or the part thereof
              to be improved, per running foot, and the town shall be liable for so much thereof
              only as is occupied by public grounds of said town bordering theron, and the crossings
              of the streets and alleys, and the owners of lots or parcels of land bordering on such
              street or alley or the part to be improved shall be liable to the constractors for
              their proportion of the cost of such improvement in the ratio of the first line of
              lots or parcels of land owned by them to the whole improved line: Provided, That when
              the owner of any lot or parcel of land shall have made any improvement in front of his
              lot or parcel of land in accordance with the general plan for the improvement of such
              street or alley, and under the direction of the Board of Trustees, he shall be
              entitled to a reasonable allowance therefor upon his proportion of the cost of such
              improvement, which reasonable allowance shall be determined by said Board Trustees:
              Provided, That every such owner of lot or parcel of land improved as aforesaid, shall
              be entitled to a credit for his road tax and road labor tax that may accrue for the
              year in which improvement is made.

            SEC. 10. When any such contract shall be made, or shall have been
              heretofore made, and shall have been fulfilled or in progress of fulfillment, the
              Board of Trustees shall have power to cause estimates to be made from time to time of
              the amount of work done by contractors, and to require such amount to be paid to him,
              deducting a reasonable per centage to secure the completion of the contract, until the
              whole shall be finished, and to prescribe the time in which the whole shall be
              completed, and such estimates shall be a lien upon the ground upon which they are
              assessed in favor or said contractors. In case any of the owners of lots or parcels of
              land on which such assessments have been made shall fail or refuse for the space of
              ten days after the day of the estimate to pay the amount thereof due by such person to
              such contractors, such contractors may immediately by a suit in any ourCt of competent
              jurisdiction recover against such owners of lots or parcels of land the amount of such
              estimate, and upon execution against the property of said defendant upon such
              judgment, the same shall be sold for cash without regard to valuation or appraisement
              laws of this State: Provided, That in such suits on estimates no
              question of fact shall be tried which may arise prior to the making of the contract
              for said improvement. Under the order of the Board of Trustees, when any contract for
              the improvement of any street or alley has been heretofore made and wholly or
              partially unpaid for, such contractors may collect the same under the provision of
              this act: Provided, The requirements of this act have been followed
              by the Board of Trustees in letting such contract.

            SEC. 11. When the original survey and plat of any incorporated
              town of this State have been, or may hereafter be lost or destroyed, the Board of
              Trustees of such town may order a survey and plat of said town to be made, and when
              such survey and plat is made and adopted by a majority of said Board of Trustees, the
              same shall be presented to the Board of Commissioners of said county, with an
              affidavit that the original survey and plat is lost, whereupon the said Board of
              Commissioners shall order the same to be recorded by the Recorder of said county as
              the survey and plat of such town.

            SEC. 12. Whereas an emergency exists for the immediate taking
              effect of this act, it is hereby declared that the same shall take effect from and
              after its passage and publication in the Indianapolis Daily Journal
              and Sentinel.

                Received and approved April 27, 1869.
              
               CONRAD BAKER, Governor. STATE OF
              INDIANA,  OFFICE OF SECRETARY OF STATE,} SS:
          
          

          
             I, M. F. A. HOFFMANN, Secretary of State for the State of
              Indiana, do hereby certify that the foregoing is a full, true and complete copy of the
              enrolled act from which the same was taken, now on file in the office of Secretary of
              State for the State of Indiana.  [SEAL.] 

            In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and affixed the Seal of the State
              of Indiana, at the City of Indianapolis, this 5th of May, A. D.,
              1869.
            
              M. F. A. HOFFMANN, Secretary of
                  State.
              
            
          
          
          
          
        
        

        
          IN SENATE.
          
            FRIDAY, May 7, 1869.
          

          The Senate met at 9 o'clock A. M.
          

          On motion by Mr. CARSON the reading of the Secretary's minutes of yesterday was
            dispensed with.

          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR laid before the Senate a message from the Governor,
            transmitting a supplemental report from the Commissioners of the House of Refuge, which
            was referred to the Committee on the House of Refuge.

          On motion of Mr. ARMSTRONG his 15th Common Pleas Court bill [S. 352] introduced late
            yesterday afternoon, was pressed to its final reading under a dispensation of the
            Constitutional restriction, and passed the Senate by yeas 43, nays, none. 

          
            SPECIFIC APPROPRIATION BILL.

            Mr. WALCOTT, from the Finance Committee, returned the Specific
              Appropriation bill [H. R. 211] with amendments.

            Mr. KINLEY offered an additional amendment appropriating $5,000 for repairs of the
              State Prison South.

            Mr. CARSON moved that the bill and amendments lie on the table, that one 100 copies
              be printed and that it be made the special order for 2 1/2 o'clock Monday
              afternoon in Committee of the Whole.

            The motion was agreed to. 

          
          

          
            SHERIFFS' MILEAGE.

            Mr. CARSON, from the Select Committee thereon, returned the Sheriffs' mileage
              bill [H. R. 53,] recommending its passage with
              amendments.

            The amendments were agreed to, and the bill having, on a former day, been read the
              third time-

            It passed the Senate by yeas 44, nays 0. 

          
          

          
            WITNESS FEES.

            On motion, by Mr. LEE, the bill [H. R. 83] to amend sections 16, 17 and 18 of the
              officers' fee bill of March 2, 1865, was read the second time.

            Mr. LEE moved to strike out of the bill all except what refers to the pay of
              witnesses. The bill increases their pay, and, as the pay of Judges, Attorneys and
              Jurors have been increased by bills passed this session, it is  but fair and just that this measure should pass.

            The amendment was agreed to.

            On the further motion of Mr. LEE, the constitutional restriction was dispensed with
              and the bill was ordered to be read the third time.

            Mr. CARSON moved to amend so that fees shall not be paid to witnesses who reside in
              the incorporated town or city where the court is held.

            Mr. HANNA opposed the amendment as conflicting with the Constitutional provision
              prohibiting class legislation.

            Mr. BRADLEY desired to amend by allowing witnesses $2 a day and mileage, no matter
              whether they live in town or country.

            Mr. LEE favored $2 a day for witnesses. The bulk of fees in small litigated cases now
              consists of witness fees, and he desired them as small as they could consistently be
              made.

            Mr. RICE regarded the amendment as unconstitutional.

            Mr. CARSON insisted that argument would lie as well against the bill in any aspect
              you may look at it. He thought it a bad bill anyhow, but he wanted to make it as good
              as he could.

            Mr. LASALLE thought the rates fixed in this bill about right. The amendment proposes
              to make unjust discrimination between classes of citizens, and therefore is clearly
              unconstitutional.

            The amendment was rejected.

            Mr. BRADLEY moved to amend the bill by increasing the fees to $2 a day.

            Mr. JOHNSON, of Spencer, insomuch as we have a bill embodying the same provision,
              moved to lay the amendment on the table.

            The motion was rejected upon a division-affirmative 15, negative 18.

            Mr. LASALLE demanded the previous question, and there being a second-

            The amendment was rejected-yeas 12, nays 27.

            The order to read the bill the third time being now executed-

            It failed to pass for want of a constitutional majority-yeas 21, nays 18. 

          
          

          
            BILLS ON THE SECOND READING.

            On motion by Mr. HOOPER, bills on the second reading were taken up for consideration
              by the Senate.

            Mr. Montgomery's bill [S. 304] to amend an amendment of section 2 of an act of
              December 2, 1865, so as to authorize the service by Constable or Sheriff of a warrant
              throughout the State, being read the second time, with a committee amendment
              thereto-

            Mr. CAVIN understood that the change proposed would allow the service of a warrant
              issued in one county by the Constables of other counties in the State. The bill was
              passed to the third reading.

            Mr. Hooper's bill [S. 235] to render taxation for common school purposes uniform
              without regard to race or color, and to extend the benefits of the common schools to
              colored children, was being read, when -

            On motion of Mr. FISHER(its provisions having been so often discussed here and it
              being evident that it can not pass - the bill was laid on the table.

            Mr. Hamilton's bill [S. 339] to amend the 3d section of the act of May 22, 1852,
              incorporating manufacturing, mining and building companies, was read the second time
              and passed to the third reading. 

          
          

          
            MUNICIPAL BANK SHARES TAXATION.

            On motion by Mr. MORGAN, the bill [H. R. 170] to tax the shares of bank stocks for
              municipal purposes, was taken up, after several dilatory motions, and read second time
              by title only.

            Mr. MORGAN moved that the bill be made the special order for to-morrow at 10
              o'clock.

            Mr. RICE moved to amend by referring the bill to the Judiciary
                Committee.

            Mr. TURNER regarded the success of such a motion as a death blow to the bill.

            Mr. RICE denied that the motion was made for the purpose of killing the bill.

            After a long conversational debate as tithe order that should be taken the motion to
              postpone the further consideration tit to-morrow taking precedence under the
              rules-

            Mr. GREEN declared the object of this filibustering to be the defeat of the bill,
              and

            Mr. GRAY'S demand for the previous question being sustained by the Senate-

            Under the pressure thereof, the motion to make this bill the special order for ten
              o'clock to-morrow was rejected by yeas 18, nays 24.

            Mr. RICE moved to refer the bill to the Judiciary Committee.

            Mr. GRAY moved instructions that the committee report the bill back by Tuesday next
              at 2 o'clock P. M.

            Pending which-

            Came the recess for dinner. 

          
          

          
            AFTERNOON SESSION.

             Mr. SHERROD, by leave, introduced a bill [S. 354] to authorize the purchase of a
              residence for the Executive of the State and appropriating $75,000 therefore provides
              for the purchase of the A property, corner of Pennsylvania and Ohio streets,] which
              was read the first time and passed to the second reading. 

          
            LIMITATION OF SPEECHES.

            Mr. BELLAMY, by leave, introduced a  resolution
              restricting debate to five minute speeches.

            Mr. FISHER moved to amend by striking out "five" and inserting
              "fifteen."

            Mr. CHURCH moved to amend the amendment by inserting "ten" instead of
              "fifteen," which was agreed to.

            The amendment as amended was agreed to.

            The resolution, as amended, was adopted. 

          
          

          
            MUNICIPAL TAXATION OF BANK SHARES.

            The Senate returned to the consideration of the municipal-bank-shares-taxation bill
              [H. R. 170], the question being on the motion to refer the bill to the
                Judiciary Committee.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR decided the pending motion to instruct the committee out of
              order at this stage, (from which decision Mr. STEIN gave notice that he should
              appeal.)

            Mr. CARSON moved to refer the bill to a select committee of one from each
              Concessional District,The motion to commit having precedence was agreed to by yeas 24,
              nays 18.

            Mr. GRAY now desired to renew his motion pending at the time of taking the recess for
              dinner.

            Mr. CARSON moved to suspend the rules that he might offer a resolution to the game
              effect.

            The motion was agreed to.

            Mr. CARSON then offered his resolution requiring the Judiciary
                Committee to report this bill back to the Senate with or without amendment
              by Tuesday at 2 o'clock P. M.

            The resolution was adopted by yeas 23, nays 19.

            Mr. STEIN now submitted his appeal from the decision of the Chair ruling out of order
              the amendment pending at the time of the noon recess.

            The question being: Shall the decision of the Chair stand as the judgment of the
              Senate?-

            On motion by Mr. BELLAMY, the appeal was laid on the table. 

          
          

          
            PROTECTION AGAINST EMPIRICISM.

            On motion by Mr. ANDREWS, the bill [H. R. 24] to regulate the standing of the Medical
              Profession, declaring who may Practice medicine in its various departments, and
              providing penalties for its violation, was taken up, and under a dispensation of the
              Constitutional restriction, Pressed to its final reading.

            Mr. BRADLEY asked, but failed to obtain, unanimous consent to strike from the first
              section the words "continuous," "continually'' and
              "consecutively."

            Mr. GIFFORD was not prepared to vote upon the bill, not having had an opportunity to
              examine it.

            Mr. WOLCOTT regarded this bill as an improper one to pass this body. There being no
              medical college in the State, it compels a party to seek education outside of the
              State before he can practice medicine in it. The bill is unjust and prescriptive in
              its character.

            Mr. HUMPHREYS, a physician himself, hoped the bill would not pass.

            Mr. CARSON was prepared to vote for the bill if it suits the medical fraternity.

            Mr. MORGAN recited the provisions o the bill, and defended it from objections. He
              thought there was nothing wrong in the bill, but, on the contrary, that it would
              stimulate young men desiring to adopt that profession to study.

            Mr. GIFFORD moved to refer the bill to the special Committee on Medical Legislation,
              with instructions to strike out the provision requiring an examination by a State
              Board at Indianapolis to the exclusion of the County Medical Boards.

            Mr. SHERROD favored the bill, declaring that it was not for the benefit of the
              medical profession so much as a measure of justice to the people.

            Mr. HANNA indicated his opposition to the bill.

            Mr. HAMILTON also was opposed to the whole thing from beginning to end.

            Mr. GRAY understood this bill to be similar to the Ohio law on this subject. He saw
              nothing objectionable in it.

            Mr. WOLCOTT made an ineffectual motion to indefinitely postpone the bill.

            The motion to refer to a special committee was then rejected.

            The bill failed to pass by yeas 19, nays 24.

            Mr. GREEN offered a resolution, which was adopted, granting the privileges of the
              floor to Hon. John Purdue, and thereupon-

            Mr. STEIN said: Mr. President. In behalf of Mr. Purdue, I tender his thanks for the
              honorable privilege accorded to him by the vote just taken. I recognize the event as a
              testimonial suggested by his connection with the legislative event of yesterday; and,
              I am authorized to add his pledge that the enterprise which through the generous act
              of the General Assembly has obtained the sanction of law, shall, so far as his efforts
              can carry it, realize all the expectations of those whose interest has been enlisted
              in the great educational project inaugurated by the Congress of our common country.
              [Applause.]

            All the Senate bills on the second reading remaining on the calendar were read by
              title only and referred to appropriate committees. 

            

            Mr. Wolcott's bill [S. 241] to amend the act of January 15, 1844, incorporating
              the University of Notre. Dame Du Lac, at South Bend, was read and laid on the table as
              superceded matter.

            Mr. Hanna's bill [S. 321] supplemental to an act creating the Twenty-fourth
              Judicial Circuit, was read the third time and laid on the table as superceded

              pass by yeas 10, nays 32.

            Mr. FOSDICK explained his opposing vote by stating that the bill would oppress poor
              people if enacted into a law.

            Mr. Hughes' omnibus bill [S. 197] to provide for an extended system of

            Mr. Wolcott's bill [S. 249] to provide for the construction and maintenance of
              fish ladders, being read the third time-

            Mr. WOLCOTT explained that fish ladders was a new invention, costing but little, and
              used in Europe and our Eastern States with great success. It is really a bill to
              cheapen an important article of food.

            The bill passed by yeas 30, nays 10.

            The bill [S. 277] regulating the employment of persons under sixteen years of age in
              cotton or woollen factories in this State [not more than eleven hours in one day]
              being read the third time-

            Mr. JOHNSON, of Spencer, moved to lay the bill on the table.

            Mr. FISHER hoped that motion would not prevail, for he was sure there were merits in
              the bill.

            The motion to lay on the table was agreed to by yeas 22, nays 15.

            Mr. Laselle's bill [S. 254], declatory of the meaning of the twenty-seventh
              section of the act of May 14, 1832, regulating descents, coming up-was laid on the
              table in the absence of the author, after being read the third time.

            Mr. Hooper's bill [S. 262], requiring certain pleadings in actions upon bills of
              exchange, &c., to be verified by affidavits, coming up-it was laid on the table
              for the game reason, after being read the third time.

            Mr. Church's bill [S. 276], for the relief of the heirs of Patrick Donovan,
              deceased, being read the third time-

            It was passed by yeas 35, nays 3.

            On motion by Mr. HOOPER, his bill [S. 262] laid on the table a few minutes since, was
              taken up. He explained its provisions. It was to save costs in courts and remedy
              abuses which have grown up in the present practice.

            Mr. BRADLEY opposed the bill, and submitted the reasons which influenced his
              opposition.

            Mr. HANNA regarded this as a of class legislation, and would, vote against the
              bill.

            The bill failed-yeas 18, nays 22.

            On motion by Mr. DENBO the bill [H. R. 119] making an appropriation of $413,599 48 to

              time.

            And then the Senate adjourned. 

          
          
          
          
        
        

        
          HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.

          The House met at 9 o'clock A. M.

          On motion of Mr. WILDMAN, Mr. Pierce, of Porter, was called to the Chair.

          On motion of Mr. DAVIDSON, the reading of the journal of yesterday was dispensed with. 

          
            HOUSE OF REFUGE.

            The SPEAKER pro tem., laid before the House
              a message from the Governor, communicating a supplimentary report from the
              Commissioners of the House of Refuge setting forth the money account, the present
              condition, and wants of the institution. It requires $1,900 a month to support the
              House of Refuge; and on that basis, the appropriation will fall short some
              $10,000.

            It was referred to the Committee on Scientific and Benevolent
                Institutions.

            Messrs. DAVIS, of Elkhart, and TEBBS presented petitions; the latter, being read, is

            REPORTS FROM COMMITTEESRESIGNATIONS

            Mr. DUNN, from a majority of the Committee on the Judiciary,
              returned his bill [H. R. 337] to amend section 50 of the act in relation to
              commissions, certificates and resignations of office, recommending the passage thereof
              without amendment.

            Mr. COFFROTH, from the minority of said committee, submitted a report that said bill
              be indefinitely postponed.

            Mr. COFFROTH. This bill is one ft prevent resignations. The present law provides that
              the resignation of members of the General Assembly shall be presented to the Governor.
              This bill provides that they shall be presented to their respective Houses, and that
              they shall not be valid till they are ratified or accepted by the proper House and the
              Governor is notified The report of the minority, recommending the indefinite
              postponement of the bill, requires the action of the House. The minority have made
              their report in contemplation of the right of every man, (when he desires to do so,)
              to resign or divest himself of office, and that just as soon as his resignation is
              made out and placed in the hands of the party having the right to receive it, his
              official existence ceases. He moved that the House concur in the report of the
              minority. 

            

            Mr. DUNN. If there be any question as he propriety of the passage of this bill it is
              a constitutional question. And he held that there is no provision in the Constitution
              prescribing as to when or in what manner resignations shall be effected. For example.
              If it is competent for the Legislature to say that resignations of its members shall
              be sent to the Governor, is it not competent for the Legislature to say that their
              resignations shall be submitted to their respective Houses? And you have said by law
              that all resignations of members of the funeral Assembly shall be sent to the
              Governor. Where did the Legislature get that right? Not from the Constitution. Then
              because the Constitution is silent on he subject, if it is competent for the
              Legislature to say that these resignations shall be sent to the Governor, it is
              equally competent for it to say that they shall be sent to the proper House; and be
              ratified before they are binding. Now what was the necessity for the passage of a bill
              of this kind? Gentlemen might say, that there are party tactics in it. But he called
              attention to the fact, that it ties the hands of both parties alike. If it ties the
              hands of a Democratic minority, it also ties the hands of a Republican minority. Its
              object is simply to provide, that members, after they have qualified here shall not
              destroy the legislation of the State, by resignation. It simply requires of members to
              stay here and do that which they have sworn to do. It ties the hands of John Doe as
              well as Richard Roe, the black man as well as the white man, (and if a black man ever
              comes here as a member, he expected that he would come as a Democrat.) It ties the
              hands of all parties alike. And he assured the House that the people of the State are
              asking that this manner of defeating legislation, shall be stopped at once and fur all
              time.

            Mr. BARRITT, interrupting. This I say : That I will never stay in my place here, and
              see such a bill as that pass.

            Mr. DUNN continuing. It was just because that spirit is here, that he insisted that
              this bill ought to be passed. And if the gentleman from Bartholomew can go before the
              people, upon that issue, and say we, the minority, are proper judges whether rt is
              proper that such and such legislation shall be had or not, he, for one, was willing
              that the gentleman should go; and he felt the assurance, and he assured the gentleman
              from Bartholomew that upon such an issue, he would never represent his own or any
              other county again.

            Mr. BARRITT. I have been sustained once; and, as I have been so instructed, I will
              try it again.

            Mr. DUNN continued, and closed by alleging that the only question here is, Will the
              people indorse the doctrine that minorities shall be judges of the expediency of
              subjects of legislation?

            Mr. COFFROTH demanded the yeas and nays on the question of concurrence in the
              minority report, and the vote resulted-yeas 43, nays 48 as follows:-

            Mr. GREENE explained his affirmative vote by the consideration which he took, that to
              press this bill now would be violative of a pledge that was given to the minority in
              this House.

            Mr. UNDERWOOD voted affirmatively, not so much because he regarded this bill as
              unconstitutional, as that he regarded it as in direct violation of that pledge to the
              minority here; as to which (though he had no part in it,) he was no more inclined to
              assist others to break their pledges than to break his own.

            So the minority report was rejected, and the bill passed to the files, with the
              report of the majority.

            Mr. OSBORN, from the majority of the Judiciary Committee, returned
              his bill [H. R. 336] defining certain misdemeanors and prescribing punishment
              therefor, recommending its passage.

            Mr. COFFROTH, from the minority of the same Committee, returned the same bill
              recommending that it be indefinitely postponed. He said this bill provides, in the
              first section, that any person elected a member of the General Assembly, and refusing
              to qualify, shall be fined $1,000.

            Mr. OSBORN. Refusing-for the purpose of preventing a quorum.

            Mr. COFFROTH accepted the explanation, they shall be fined at least one thousand
              dollars, and as much more as the court and jury see proper. The second section
              provides that, if members resign for a like object, they shall be treated in like
              manner. He moved that the report of the minority be concurred in, and thereupon
              demanded the yeas and nays.

            Mr. OSBORN. This bill has been offered in good faith. It is for the purpose of
                securing legislation proposed by the majority.
              There being barely time to pass the pressing bills, he gave notice that some time
              today he would move to take up these bills this and that of the gentleman from
              Lawrence and consider them. He hoped the minority report would riot be concurred in.
              The vote was then taken and it resulted as follows: yeas 54, nays 38.

            Mr. GORDON, explaining, said he voted to concur in the report, to secure the
              consideration of Mr. Dunn's bill, [H. R. 337.]

            Mr. MONROE voted affirmatively, because of the indefiniteness of the bill.

            Mr. WILLSON explaining. We have a great deal of important legislation yet to do; and
              it would be impossible to pass this bill in its regular order; and we might consume
              the balance of the session in discussions of such propositions; and believing that we
              have the same power to perform any act of legislation without the minority that we
              have with them; he voted aye.

            So the report of the minority was concurred in, and the bill was indefinitely
              postponed.

            Mr. COFFROTH moved to reconsider this vote arid to lay the motion on the table; the
              latter motion was agreed to.

            EVANSVILLE AND MADISON CRIMINAL COURTS.

            On motion of Mr. WELBORN, the House took up the report of the Committee of
                Conference on the disagreeing votes of the Two Houses as to the Senate
              amendment to his bill [H. R. 90] for a Criminal
              Court at Evansville, providing for a Criminal Court at Evansville, providing for a
              Criminal Circuit Court for Madison, in Jefferson county, recommending that the House
              recede from its non-concurrence.

            The report of the Conference Committee was concurred in, and the
              House receeded from its non-concurrence in the Senate amendment.

            Mr. McBRIDE called atention to an error in these reports yesterday, in the
              description of his joint resolution for removal of Director F.M. Meredith by address.
              These words: "He having resigned," should read "W. Ghee having
              resigned."

            The House then took up the consideration of Senate bills in the Calendar, and those
              numbered 45, 75, 191, 220, 258, 261, 118, 148, 149, 162, 166, 172, 173, 122, 167, 230,
              285, 181, 188, 194, 205, 210, 223, and 120,
              were severally read through and passed either to appropriate committees or to their
              places in the Calendar. And the bill [S. 184] was laid on the table. 

          
          

          
            AFTERNOON SESSION.

            The SPEAKER resumed at 2 o'clock P. M.

            Mr. ODELL submitted an order (which was adopted by consent) for one copy of the
              Adjutant General's Report to be furnished Irwin Dickinson, and such other
              soldiers, employes of the House, as have not received a copy of the same.

            Mr. UNDERWOOD submitted a resolution to order from the publishers a copy of
              Wilson's Digest of Parliamentary Law to each member of the House of
              Representatives.

            Mr. STEPHENSON proposed to add - "Jaynes' Almanac"; and Mr. COFFROTH
              proposed - "the New England Primer;" and then -

            On motion of Mr. CORY, the resolution and amendments were laid on the table.

            Mr. WILLIAMS, of Knox, entered his motien to reconsider the vote of yesterday for
              removal of F.M. Meredith from the Directorship of the Southern Prison. 
       
          
            THE MORGAN RAID BILL.

            The SPEAKER announced the special order, viz: the consideration of Mr.
              Hutching's Morgan raid appropriation bill, [H. R. 119,] the question being on the
              engrossment.

            Mr. DUNN proposed to amend by adding a section to provide that none of the claims and
              accounts, the payment of which are provided for, shall be assignable, etc,; and
              declaring that before the Auditor shall issue his warrant for any such payment, the
              claimant shall file his affidavit, stating that he has not assigned, or sold, or in
              any manner disposed of, his claim or any part of it, etc.

            Mr. DAVIS, of Floyd, as a friend of the bill, said that he would offer no opposition
              to the amendment; and it was adopted by unanimous consent.

            Mr. GORDON opposed the bill. His chief objection was, that when the State of Indiana
              shall once open the door for the allowance of these claims, there will be no end to
              the claims that will come up for allowances of this character. The State of Ohio had
              allowed but half the amount of these claims in that State; and so far as he saw, the
              claims for losses by loyal persons in all the Southern States were just as good as
              these as against the State of Indiana. He spoke at some length, alleging the
              -disloyalty of some of these claimants.

            Mr. PIERCE, of Porter, supported the bill, and therein he believed that he
              represented the feeling of the people of the northern part of the State. He regarded
              the bill as simply a measure of justice.

            Mr. DAVIS, of Floyd, replied to the objections submitted by Mr. Gordon. As to the
              allegation that some were disloyal in the southern part of the State, that was no good
              objection to the bill; for we were cursed with bad men in all parts of the State. The
              loyal people have a right to the He referred to 
              the commission authorized by the Legislature to investigate these claims; its
              impartial and intelligent character; its favorable recommendation, and the Executive
              recommendations for the allowance of these claims. He suggested, also, the fact that
              many of these claimants were utterly despoiled and ruined by the raiding enemy; and
              that they had already waited too long for the State's indemnification. With
              reference to the reimbursement of the State by the General Government for what she may
              do in this direction, he stated that the State of Ohio has been reimbursed for the
              part of these claims which she has paid. He believed that the State would be
              reimbursed, but, whether or not, the justice of the claims remained, and in his mind
              the case rested on the question of justice alone. Most of these claimants were in the
              field, in the front of the strife, when they sustained their losses, and many of them
              are the heirs of those who fell. When he had concluded-

            Mr. OVERMYER proposed to amend further, by adding a provision requiring the claimant
              to takfe a test oath of antecedent and future loyalty (commonly called "the
              ironclad") which was rejected.

            The question recurring on ordering the engrossment and third reading of the bill-

            Mr. DAVIS, of Floyd, demanded the previous question, and thereunder, the bill was
              ordered to be engrossed-yeas 70, nays 16.

            The bill was then read the third time, and the vote on the final reading
              resulted-yeas 52, nays 41-as follows:

                    the claim of the State of Indiana against the General Government, before the
                    Government Commission, now in session at Indianapolis, for the amount assumed by
                    her in paying the losses to the citizens of the State by reason of the Morgan
                    raid, and to use all proper means to secure its early allowance and adjustment
                    by said Commission. 
                
              
            

          
          

          
            THE GENERAL ELECTION BILL.

            On motion of Mr. PIERCE of Vigo House took up the Senate's amendments to the
              bill reported from the Committee on Elections, on the third of February last, [H. R. 140] repealing certain sections of the
              Registry Act of March 11, 1867. And the Senate amendments having been read -

            Mr. PIERCE, of Vigo, proposed to concur in the Senate amendments, with an additional
              section:

            "That all laws and parts of laws coming in conflict with this act are hereby
              repealed."

            Mr. COFFROTH had no objection to that amendment. It was of no consequence, for, of
              course, the latest act repeals conflicting laws. He did not propose to discuss this
              matter again. This election bill as it passed the House merely repealing the registry
              law, except the first section, which require a residence, was well enough, but the
              Senate had added a fifth section, which requires the inspector of elections to place a
              number on each ballotcorresponding with the number of the voters name. He had objected
              to that proposition at the time it was brought forward in the House because it
              destroys the secrecy of the ballot-being tantamount to a viva voce election. This he
              regarded as an infringement upon the spirit of the Constitution, if not a violation of
              its very letter. But the bill comes back from the Senate with this amendment. It was
              simply on this account that he could not vote for the bill. He asked for the yeas and
              nays.

            Mr. PIERCE, of Porter, suggested that perhaps it would be best not to hurry this vote
              as he understood there is now pending in the Senate a motion to reconsider this
              amendment.

            The vote on concurrence was then taken, resulting yeas 53, nays 39-as follows:

            So the Senate amendments were concurred in. 

          
          

          

          
            THE COUNTY SEAT BILL.

            On motion of Mr. BOBO, his County Seat bill [H. R. 325] was taken up - the question
              being on the third and last reading thereof.

            It proposes that where two-thirds of the tax-payers and legal voters shall petition,
              procure two and one-fourth acres of ground for a site, etc., the commissioners may
              locate, etc.

            Mr. BOBO said the change from the existing law was from "legal voters" to
              "tax-payers," from "fifty-five per cent" to "sixty-six per
              cent." With regard to what the petitioners shall do for a new site, what the
              Auditor and the Commissioners shall do, this bill was copied from the old law.

            The bill was finally passed the House - yeas 67, nays 15. 

          
          

          
            GIRLS' REFORMATORY.

            On motion of Mr. STEWART, of Rush, the Senate amendments to Mr. Stewart's
              Girls' Reformatory bill, H. R. 176,] were
              taken up and concurred in. 

          
          

          
            RIGHT OF APPEAL FROM THE COMMON PLEAS.

            Mr. PIERCE, of Vigo, now obtained leave to report back from the minority of the
                Committee on the Judiciary, Mr. Dittemore's bill, [H. R.
              255,] to save pending will cases affected by the laws of 1865,-stating that as it is
              only to affect a single case, etc,; the minority of said Committee recommended that it
              be indefinitely postponed.

            Mr. DUNN opposed concurrence in the minority report, and showed that the passage of
              this bill is expedient to correct an act of 1865, which forbids the appeal of will
              cases from the Common Pleas to the Circuit-to destroy special legislation by special
              legislation. He took a wide range into the mazes of facts and arguments involved.

             Mr. STEPHENSON took a similar view.

            Mr. PIERCE, of Vigo, alleging his familiarity with the case on which the bill is
              founded, traced the history of the gradual withdrawal of legal authority to appeal
              cases from the Common Pleas to the Circuit, and stated what is undeniable-that it
              works general satisfaction. He then took up and traced the facts in the will case of
              John Burton and others against Tabitha Burton, alleging and showing that this case was
              never properly filed in the Circuit Court as appealed from the Terre Haute Common
              Pleas, and therefore it could not be affected by this bill or the act of 1865. He
              spoke at length in reply to Mr. Dunn, exhonerating the attorneys of the Burton
              children from any interested connection with the passage of the act of 1865, etc. When
              he had concluded -

            The House adjourned. 

          
          
          
          
        
        

        
          IN SENATE.
          
             SATURDAY, May 8,1869.
          

          The Senate met at 9 o'clock A. M.

          On motion of Mr. CRAVENS the reading of the Secretary's minutes of yesterday was
            dispensed with. 

          
            MORGAN RAID CLAIMS.

            Mr. CRAVENS moved that the $413,599 48 Morgan raid claims bill [H. R. 119] be taken
              up and read the second time for the purpose of reference to a Committee.

            The motion was agreed to by yeas 26, nays 13.

            Mr. BRADLEY, without desiring to indicate opposition to the bill voted
              "no."

            Mr. CARSON voted "no" because of his opposition to hasty legislation.

            Mr. CHURCH voted "aye" solely with a view to having the bill referred to a
              committee.

            Mr. GREEN voted "aye" because it is better to suspend the rules than to
              have a controversy over the question now.

            So the rules were suspended, and the bill [H. R. 119] appropriating $413,599 48, to
              pay the claims of sufferers by the Morgan raid, was read the second time.

            Mr. CRAEVNS moved to refer the bill to a special committee of five.

            Mr. WOLCOTT moved that the bill be referred to the Standing Committee on
                Claims.

            Mr. CRAVENS objected to this motion. To be frank, his object was to send the bill
              into the hands of its friends. There is nothing to be investigated in this matter-we
              know the facts-they are patent to the whole country.

            Mr. GREEN took a similar view. The bill ought to have a fair chance, and should be
              placed in charge of its friends.

            Mr. WOLCOTT thought a bill like this-ought not to have any special friends. It
              appropriates nearly half a million of dollars, and it should go to a fair, impartial,
              uninterested Committee. The Committee on Claims has shown itself to
              be an impartial and fair Committee; that is the proper Committe to consider claims
              presented to this body, and why should Senators object so strenuously to the pending
              motion?

            Mr. FISHER said the strongest argument in favor of this bill is that if the State
              pays these claims it will be reimbursed by the general government, and that similar
              claims have been reimbursed to Ohio. This he regarded as a mistake. The general
              government reimbursed Ohio only for money paid for property destroyed by United States
              troops. The property destroyed by the Union forces only will be reimbursed by the
              general government, and; that amounts to only about $50,000 of this $413,599 48. This
              is a serious question.  And then if this claim is
              to be paid by the State, the Treasury will be bankrupt, and additional taxes will have
              to levied to meet deficiencies.

            Mr. BELLAMY favored the reference to a special committee. A similar bill was in the
              hands of a standing committee of the Senate last session, and was kept by them five
              weeks without being reported back.

            Mr. FISHER and Mr. KINLEY explained how the delay occurred.

            Mr. HOOPER entered his protest against referring a bill of this character to its
              friends. Bills proposing to make large appropriations from the treasury should be
              referred to a regular standing committee. A bill such as this, monstrous in its
              proportions - proposing to drain the treasury and bankrupt the State, should be
              referred not to its friends, but to a regular standing committee, appointed with
              especial reference to the consideration of just such subjects as the one embodied in
              the pending proposition.

            Mr. TURNER regarded this matter of reference as a question of but little
              importance.

            Mr. HANNA made the point of order that the question to refer to a select committee
              takes precedence under the Senate rules.

            Mr. SCOTT inquired if the claims are to to be allowed on the faith of the Morgan Raid
              Commission, why refer this bill at all? It is too late in the session now for a
              committee to investigate the truth of the report of the Commission.

            Mr. CARSON remembered a report from a committee of the Senate last session which
              showed that there was no liability on the part of the State for these claims.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR said the rule did not require the precedence of motions, in
              the order in which the committees are named in the Senate rule referred to, and
              therefore, it does not conflict with general parliamentary law. He preferred that this
              claim should be presented to the United State Commission appointed to adjust such
              claims, now in session in this city, as provided for in a House concurrent resolution
              just reported here, that we might have the opinion of that Commission as to how much
              of this claim the General Government would allow.

            Mr. BELLAMY moved to lay the motion to refer to a standing committee on the
              table.

            The motion was agreed to, upon division, affirmative 23, negative not counted.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR remarking that the vote of the Senate clearly indicated a
              desire that the Morgan raid claims bill should be sent to a committee of its friends,
              made that committee to consist of Messrs. Cravens, Huffman, Bellamy, Denbo and Rice. 

          
          

          
            REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.

            Mr. RICE from the Committee on Corporations, returned the railroad
              transportation bill [H.R. 105] recommending that it lie on the table.

            Mr. CRAVENS, from the select committee appointed last session on the question of
              courtesy between the two Houses on the transmission of messages, reported that the
              cause of complaint on the part of the House was not on account of the action of the
              Secretary of the Senate, &c., and that he was not deserving the censure or
              punishment suggested by the House of Representatives.

            The report was concurred in.

            On motion by Mr. ROBINSON, of Madison, the House amendments to the election bill
                (H. R. 140) was read and concurred in.

            Mr. WOLCOTT moved to take up the concurrent resolution from the House of
              Representatives, providing for a presentation of the Morgan raid claims to the United
              States Commission, now in session in this city, that we may have their opinion on the
              validity of the claim.

            The motion was agreed to, and the resolution having been read - 

            Mr. HANNA suggested that the State has no claim against the United States; and
              thereupon -

            Mr. WOLCOTT, not knowing the language of the resolution till he heard it read,
              withdrew his motion.

            A majority of the Committee on Fees and Salaries reported against
              allowing extra compensation - mileage - to the members of the Committee on the State
              Prison for visiting said prison.

            Mr. GREEN stated that he would not present a minority report, though he thought the
              members of that committee should be allowed something for mileage.

            On motion by Mr. GIFFORD, the report was referred to a select committee of three.A
              committee report, recommending that the bill [S. 344] to encourage the destruction of
              foxes lie on the table, was made and concurred in. 

          
          

          
            SENATE BILLS ON THE FINAL READING.

            On motion of Mr. JOHNSTON, of Montgomery, the Senate proceeded to the consideration
              of Senate bills on the third reading;

            

            Mr Bellamy's bill [S. 244] to amend section 5 of the Common School law, coming
              up-

            Before the reading was finished, it was laid on the table. 

          
          

          
            THE XVTH CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTUNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE.

            Mr. FISHER, noticing a good deal of nervousness on the part of our Democratic fiends,
              in order to quiet it asked and obtained leave to offer the following:

            WHEREAS, At an early day in the present session of the Senate, it
              was ordered that the question of the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment to the
              Constitution of the United States be postponed to and made the special order for
              Tuesday, and the 11th day of May;

            AND WHEREAS, Other important legislation is
              still pressing upon the Senate; therefore, be it 

            Resolved, That the consideration of said amendment be further postponed until Friday,
              the 14th day of May, at half-past two o'clock P.M., and made the special order
              for that hour.

            The PRESIDENT pro tem. [Hon. John R.
              Cravens.] I would say that the resolution is clearly out of order. The Senate, in the
              first clays of the session, agreed to postpone the consideration of the Constitutional
              amendment till the llth of May. Such a resolution passed. Then a motion was made to
              reconsider and that motion was laid on the table. It was clinched on both sides. The
              only way this thing can be reached is to pass a resolution that when the llth of May
              arrives you will take up the amendment, and again postpone its consideration.

            Mr. HANNA. I suppose by unanimous consent we might stay the order.

            The PRESIAENT pro tem. I don't see
              how, unless the Senate retraces its steps, and I don't see how you can get over
              the operations of parliamentary law at any rate. It would be competent for the Senate
              now to pass a resolution saying that on the llth of May they would again postpone the
              consideration of that measure.

            Mr. HANNA. Well, shape it in that form.

             Mr. GRAY. I have no doubt but that the decision of the chair is right; that question
              is tied up, but the Senator from Wabash [Mr. Fisher] can amend his resolution as
              suggested by the chair.

            Mr. FISHER. Will the chair indicate the character of the amendment again? 

            The PRESIDENT pro tem. I did not intend to
              suggest it for the purpose of having anything done upon my suggestion. And only thing
              competent to be done now would be to pass a resolution pledging ourselves, if you want
              to pledge, that on that day we would postpone the further consideration of the
              amendment till a day certain. I am not making any ruling with special reference to
              action on this matter. I know what the general wish is, and as far as I could make a
              ruling consistent with it, I would. 

          
          

          
            SENATE BILLS ON THE FINAL READING.

            The Senate resumed the consideration of Senate bills on the third reading.

            Mr. Beardsley's bill [S. 22] to regulate interest on judgments and decrees,
              coming up, it was laid on the table as superceded matter.

            Mr. Hadley's bill [S. 61] providing for amendment of pleadings and papers in the
              courts of this State, coming up, was laid on the table in the absence of the
              author.

            Mr. Laselle's bill to repeal section 18 of the act regulating descents, coming
              up-

            It failed to pass by yeas 8, nays 29.

            The bill [S. 343] to secure a just valuation and taxation of railroad property in
              this State, being now reported from the Committee on Corporations
              with a favorable recommendation-

            Mr. CARSON entered his protest against such a hasty consideration of this bill by the
              committee. 

          
          

          
            THE XVTH CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT AGAIN.

            Mr. FISHER now obtained leave to offer the following:


            
              
                
                  Resolved, That the special order for the llth day of May, viz
                    : the fifteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States, when taken
                    up on that day shall be further postponed to Friday, the 14th day of May, at
                    half past two o'clock, and made the special order for that hour.
                
              
            

            Mr. CARSON opposed the resolution. We have had that order fixed, and it was
              distinctly understood what the action of both parties would be on that occasion. The
              session was limited to the llth day of May, and he wanted it to stop there, and he had
              intended to resign on the 10th. He wanted the Senate to stand upon what they said when
              they fixed that order.

            The yeas and nays being demanded, ordered and taken resulted-yeas 30, nays 10, as
              follows:

            
              
                
                  YEAS-Messrs. Andrews, Bradley, Case, Caven, Church, Denbo,
                    Eliott, Fisher, Fosdick, Gifford, Gray, Green, Hamilton, Hanna, Henderson, Hess,
                    Huey, Huffman, Humphreys, Jaquess, Johnson of Spencer, Johnson of Montgomery,
                    Morgan, Rice, Robinson of Madison, Scott, Sherrod, Taggart Turner, Wood-30.

                  NAYS-Messrs. Beardsley, Bird, Carson, Cravens, Hooper,
                    Kinley, Montgomery, Reynolds. Smith, Wolcott.-10. 
                
              
            

          
          

          
            SENATE BILLS ON THE FINAL READING.

            The Senate returned to the order of business, viz: the final reading of Senate
              bills.

            Mr. Kinleys's bill, (S. 150,) denning the common school system of the State
              being read the third time.

            Mr. CARSON indicated his opposition.

            Mr. KINLEY said the object of the bill was simply to establish a graded common school
              system in the State, by which pupils can graduate from the primary school  up to the State University, Normal School or Agricultural
              College.

            Mr. JOHNSTON, of Montgomery, made an ineffectual motion to lay the bill on the
              table.

            Mr. BRADLEY could see no good purpose in the bill.

            Mr. GRAY could see no necessity for it and should have to vote against the bill.

            It failed to pass-yeas 16, nays 18.

            Mr. CHURCH offered an amendment which was adopted, that when the Senate adjourn it be
              till 10 o'clock Monday morning.

            Mr. Hanna's bill [S. 278] concerning appeals in cases of contempt -having
              reference to newspaper publications-being read the third time-

            The bill passed by yeas 35, nays 1.

            Mr. Sherrod's bill [S. 284] to provide
              for the erection and repairs of bridges on streams forming the boundary line between
              two counties, being read the third time-

            The bill passed by yeas 34, nays 1.

            Mr. Caven's bill (S. 293) to amend section 25 of the Felony act of June 10, 1852
              being read the third time-

            Mr. CAVEN explained that the bill extends the liability for signing blanks by
              officers to be afterwards filled up.

            On motion by Mr. BRADLEY-no Senator objecting-the bill was amended by adding in the
              proper place these words: "with intent to defraud any one."

            The bill passed by yeas 33, nays 1.

            And then the Senate adjourned till Monday morning at 10 o'clock. 

          
          

          

            CORRECTION.-Early in the proceedings of yesterday, at the end of
              the first line in Mr. Carson's motion to amend the witness fee bill these words
              are omitted : "the increase of". 

          
          

        
        

        
          HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.

          
            PERSONAL-A CORRECTION.

            Mr. OVERMYER rose to a question of privilege. There was an error, he said, in these
              reports of yesterday's (Friday's) proceedings on the final passage of the
              Morgan Raid bill, which does injustice to his (Mr. O's) position to that bill. He
              did not move to amend so "that the claimant should take the iron-clad oath,"
              as understood by the reporter. What he did was to send to the Clerk's desk and
              cause to be read the proof of loyalty which, was required of every claimant to be give
              before the Morgan Raid Commission. This was done to answer an objection raised by Mr.
              Gordon, to the effect that many of the claimants were disloyal men. That which was
              read by the Clerk shows that the claimants, where they came before the commission, had
              to take "the iron-clad" themselves, and prove their loyalty by other
              witnesses besides.

            The SPEAKER announced the order the unfinished business of yesterday-the
              consideration of Mr. Dittemore's bill [H. R. 255] to save pending will cases
              affected by the law of 1865 the Burton Will Case bill.

            Mr. GORDON (by leave) returned the, bill in relation to the compensation of Judges of
              the Criminal Courts," etc., recommending its passage. 

            Mr. McGREGOR asked for leave to change his vote yesterday on the final passage of the
              Morgain Raid bill-from yes to no. 

            The SPEAKER. It could not be done without unanimous consent, The Chair hears
              objections.

            Mr. PIERCE, of Porter, moved to suspend the order of business for the consideration
              of the Drainage bill [S. 134]. 

            The SPEARER ruled against the motion. When there is an order for the consideration of
              a bill or any special proposition, the Chair will hold that pending the consideration
              of that bill or proposition, it is not in order to move to suspend that 'order
              for something else. We are now acting under the order of the House for the
              consideration of the Burton Will case.

            Mr. DAVIS, of Floyd, rose to a question of privilege, and entered his motion to
              reconsider the vote of yesterday for the indefinite postponement of a certain Swamp
              Land bill he had fargotten the number-but had a request from Judge Stanfield as to
              that matter, which he desired to present. 

          
          

          
            THE WILL CASE BILL.

            Mr. Dittemore's Will case bill [H. R. 235] was then taken up.

            Mr. PIERCE of Vigo took the floor with an apology for the time this case has
              consumed, and with justification for the range of debate which he had taken, because
              of the reference of the gentleman from Lawrence (Mr. Dunn) to a certain printed brief
              called the Burton Will Case, and because, as he believed, the passage of this bill
              would not be urged now, but for the pendency of this will case. For this bill was
              specially designed to allow these parties to come in again with their action for this
              property, the right to which has been settled for four years. He submitted whether we
              have any right to pass a law which will livest these children of their vested rights;
              and he insisted that we have no such right, and that if passed the act must be
              nugatory. He suggested the difficulties about the fairness and justice of a new trial
              of this case now that it is impossible to recover he facts and witnesses in the case.
              He contended also that there was nothing on the part of those parties desiring to
              re-open his case, that could justly demand this legislation.

            

            Mr. JOHNSTON, of Parke, took the floor in reply to Mr. Pierce and in explanation and
              justification of the vote he intended to case for the passage of the bill. He stated
              the object of the bill - to secure and save to those parties the vested rights of
              which they are divested by the act of 1865. Gentlemen who are not lawyers might be
              deceived by the argument of the gentleman from Vigo to show that this case was
              dismissed because the transcript was not filed. He showed that in the act of 1865
              there was no saving clause for parties to cases then pending. Every lawyer knows that
              at time the trial of a case before the Common Pleas was with the right of appeal to
              the Circuit Court, and for that reason parties would not be careful to plead
              exceptions to the rulings of the court in the case, the instructions to the jury,
              &c. And if he could go out of the case, he could assign other reasons for voting
              for this bill. There was no proposition in the bill to repeal the act denying appeals
              from the Common Pleas to the Circuit Court, but simply a provision to allow these
              parties to this case, pending when the act of 1865 was passed, to go into the Circuit
              Court for trial. He went more at length into the argument, insisting that the pending
              bill is founded on the simplest appreciation of common sense and common justice in
              this case - to restore to parties the rights which the Legislature have taken away
              from them.

            Mr. WILLIAMS of Hamilton, demanded the previous question; but no quorum voting on the
              question for a second to the demand, a call of the House was ordered, and then the
              House refused to second the demand for the previous question.

            Mr. COFFROTH then took the floor for the passage of the bill, considering questions
              of law involved, and answering objections urged by gentlemen opposing the toll. He
              showed that the right of appeal from the Common Pleas to the Circuit Court, which
              existed at the time of the passage of the act of 1865, would certainly lend to laxity
              in attending to any case on such trial, and it was simply a question of the right of
              parties to a restoration of their rights taken away by the act of 1865. To the
              suggestion of Mr. Pierce that witnesses are dead, and that it would be impossible to
              have a fair trial now, he replied that witnesses are dead on both sides, and there was
              the recourse to their written testimony. By way of replying further to Mr. Pierce he
              recounted the story of the life and thrift of John Burton and his wife; the widow
              being largely entitled to the property, because of her efficiency in procuring it,
              under the hard working of the law is excluded from it in her heirs - her children
              before her intermarriage with Burton: and her children would have been thus entitled
              under the will of John Burton. Was not that a good and proper will? He must say that
              the jury that could set it aside, must have been misled. The justice of this case was
              all in favor of the child of John Burton's widow. He then spoke to the objection,
              that the Burton will case was not pending in 1865, when the act passed. If that were
              so, then this bill would not affect the Burton case. Would any man say, if the act of
              1865 were now pending-now on its passage here-that it would not be right to save
              pending suits? To save pending suits and vested rights was a common thing in
              Legislation. True, he voted for the act of 1765-just as others do frequently, in the
              stress of business, and when no question is raised. He did not know under what
              influences the act of 1865 came here and was passed. It was true that it was drawn by
              one of the attorneys-the principal attorney, Colonel J. Baird-and brought here by him
              just after this case was tried, but, of course, with no purpose to affect this case.
              With reference to the objection that this Burton case was not opened in the Circuit
              Court on occount of the act of 1865, but on account of some discrepancy in the papers,
              he said this difficulty with reference to the papers could have beer avoided simply by
              a ruling-an order of the Court. But the fact was, the case was not brought by appeal
              to the Circuit Court, because it was forbidden by the act of 1865.

            Mr. WELBORN discussed the merits of the bill, without reference to the Burton
              case-the only question being: Should we pass a bill to give new trials to parties with
              casses pending in the Common Pleas when the act of 1865 was passed. He showed, that
              if, in this Burton case, the appeal had been perfected at the time of the passage of
              that act of 1865, the trial could not by that act, have been prevented in the Circuit
              Court. It was but special pleading to say, that parties having the right to appeal do
              not attend to their business. The fact that the members of the Legislature of 1865
              knew nothing of the Burton will case, should weigh against the passage of this bill.
              To vote for this bill was to vote for a law suit-a big one-involving $75,000-and for
              the accommodation of interested lawyers. He urged that the House should not, by the
              passage of this bill, invite numerous and expensive law suits all over the State.

            Mr. KERCHEVAL demanded the previous question, arid under its operation the House
              House refused to concur in the report of the minority of the committee, without a
              division, and the question recurred:

            Shall the bill be ordered to the second reading.

            Mr. OSBORN moved to amend, by providing to this effect: That in any case affected by this bill, where the witnesses at the
              first trial can not be had, and where the testimony at the original trial was taken
              and preserved, such testimony shall be competent on the new trial.

            Mr. COFFROTH said, the law is plain and ample on that subject. It is competent
              to-prove what was testified on the former trial.

            Mr. OSBORN. It had been said, that this bill was not offered here because of the
              decease of witnesses. And if this Burton case is to be put back where it was before,
              it ought to be put as nearly as possible in the same condition that it stood
              originally. It was known r that before this bill was offered here, important witnesses
              in this case had died. The gentleman from Huntington says it is competent to prove
              what was testified. Still he desired to place in the hands of parties the same
              testimony that was originally introduced, and let it be adduced on the new trial. It
              is no more in the interest of one party than the other. He understood that this
              testimony on the original trial was taken down by a disinterested party, and that it
              has been preserved; and the object of this amendment is to obtain to perpetuate the
              testimony of such witnesses as cannot be produced. Then, if this is a cause of justice
              and equity, what harm can be done by the amendment. It is pretended that this bill is
              not offered to gain anything by the death of witnesses. But, were these witnesses now
              living he did not believe this bill would have been brought in here. This testimony is
              to perpetuate the testimony on both sides which was adduced on the first trial.

            Mr. COFFROTH insisted that the law is ample in its provisions for such cases. But
              this amendment proposes to go further, and introduce to the jury the notes taken by
              the lawyer in the case-unattested, unsworn to. He did think that such a rule would be
              a dangerous one.

            Mr. OSBORN. Of course, the person that took the notes would have to swear that they
              are correct.

            Mr. COFFROTH. It did not make it any better than the, existing provisions of the law.
              And on his motion the amendment was laid on the table. He then moved to suspend the
              constitutional restriction, that the bill may be now put upon its final passage-and
              the vote resulted-yeas 64, nays 21.

            The SPEAKER held that the constitutional restriction can not be suspended without the
              concurrence of of 67 members - two-thirds of the members elect - the House in the
              meaning of the Constitution.

            Mr. COFFROTH said the constant ruling here had been, that two-thirds of a quorum is
              sufficient to- suspend.

            Subsequently-after debate on this of order-a reconsideration and re-vote the motion
              to suspend resulted-yeas 65 nays 24.

            On motion of Mr. COFFROTH, the bill was then read the second time, and passed to the
              third reading to-morrow.

            Mr. PIERCE, of Vigo, proposed to amend by a provision, that this act shall not affect
              nor apply to any case which was not pending in the circuit court at the time of the
              passage of the act of 1865, nor to any case in which the law had not'been
              complied with, and the appeal fully perfected.

            Mr. COFFROTH. Is not that the bill now?

            Mr. PIERCE. It goes further than the fact that it was pending. There may have been
              certain things neglected which parties should have done to perfect their appeal. It is
              to provide that this act shall not apply to any case where the appeal was not
              perfected.

            On motion of Mr. COFFROTH, the amendment was laid on the table, and on his further
              motion the bill was made the special order for Monday morning at 9 o'clock.

            Mr. RUDDELL desired to advance on the calendar his bill [H. R. 4] to enable cities to
              aid railroads, which had been modified and almost destroyed by the committee, and was
              now numbered 132; but enough of the original proposition remained to make it desirable
              to have it pass. But there was objection. 

          
          

          
            THE SWAMP LAND BILL.

            Pursuant to a previous order, moved by Mr. PIERCE, of Porter, the House took up the
              bill [S. 134] to authorize the construction of
              levees, dykes and drains and the reclamation of wet and overflowed lands by
              incorporated associations, and to repeal, etc.

            The SPEAKER. The bill has been read twice. It is open to amendment.

            Mr. PALMER proposed to amend by striking out the word "estimate" and
              inserting the word "assessment" In lieu: and to strike out sections 15 and
              17.

            On motion of Mr. JOHNSON, of Marshall, it was laid on the table.

            Mr. COFFROTH proposed to amend by adding at the end of section 17 a provision, to
              this effect: That nothing in this act shall be held or construed to modify or repeal
              in whole or in part the act to entitle the owners of wet lands to drain the same
              without affecting the rights of others, approved March 11, 1807. He understood that it
              is not the intention of the friends of this DI > to repeal the private ditching,
              law.

            The amendment was adopted.

            On motion of Mr. RATLIFF, the first amendment above proposed by Mr. Palmer, was
              adopted.

            

            Mr. COFFROTH said: The 16th section provides that, after the appraisement is made,
              the schedule filed, &c., any person aggrieved thereby may appeal within thirty
              days, but the provision does not include persons under legal disabilities. He proposed
              an amendment, to give such persons the distinct right of appeal, etc.

            The amendment was adopted.

            The bill was then read the third time as amended.

            Mr. LAMBORN would undertake to say that this bill is a scheme for plunder; that its
              enforcement would rob perhaps hundreds of poor men of the State of their homesteads.
              It is well known that in the swamp land districts there are many occupants of small
              farms who have secured places which they call their homes; and it is well known that
              many of these have small debts hanging over them; and, if this bill becomes a law and
              gives those companies power to assess these small farmers for their drainages, they
              will not be able to pay, and their homes will be swept away from them. He asserted
              again that this bill was a scheme for capitalists to absorb the lands of the people;
              that all such legislation is wrong and repugnant to the instincts of a republican
              people, and that the operation of this bill will certainly work great hardship against
              the poorer class of the people of the State. It should be the policy of the State and
              nation to preserve the land for homes for laborers. He considered that since we have
              got rid of the infernal system of slavery, the next important consideration is to
              protect the poor men of the country in their right to acquire homes for their
              families; for, take away their power to get homes and what will become of them? The
              moment you deprive a man of that right, instead of being a friend he becomes an enemy
              to you, and I give him credit for it. I say the tendency of such legislation is to
              make enemies.

            Mr. OSBORN interposing. How does it make them enemies?

            Mr. LAMBORN. It gives the power to a few capitalists to drain the lands of poormen
              who are not asking them to do so, and to absorb their lands and take them away from
              them, because they may not be able to pay their assessments. That is what has been
              done, and is by this bill to be done again; and I declare here, once for all my
              eternal hostility to this kind of legislation. It is the duty of the people of the
              State and the country to so shape their legislation that the wants and desires of the
              poor shall be respected. And it is the desire of every man who lives upon the bosom of
              this green earth to get himself a home. It is the great longing of this life. And the
              moment the State introduces a system of legislation which takes away this
              privilege-the gratification of this longing in a greater or less degree-that moment it
              destroys patriotism in the hearts of the people-the love of country, the vitality of
              the State, is gone. What is it that makes our country strong-stronger than any other
              country? It is because our territory, our broad and rich domain, invites every man to
              secure to himself a home. If our territory were not more extensive than that of Great
              Britain, our system of legislation would not be a whit better than theirs for the
              securing of the happiness of the people. We ought to live with some regard to the
              future-to the welfare of those are to be after us. It may be a long time before this
              country will be filled with population as England and France and portions of New
              England; but the time must come, and will come, when these broad acres will all be
              needed for the comfort, happiness, homes of the people.

            Mr. PIERCE, of Porter. Certainly if there is any such thing designed in the bill as
              the gentleman from White and Benton has indicated, it ought to be defeated; but this
              bill has been carefully examined. It passed the Senate after having passed the
              scrutiny of the Judiciary Committee of that body, and I understand
              that it has the endorsement of the Judges of the Supreme Court. If the bill succeeds,
              it will assist in the development of a large amount of swamp land that is now
              valueless. I have no interest in the bill except this: I have some constituents who
              are interested in it, and they have asked me to look after it. Impelled by their
              interest-not mine-I have looked into the bill, and I now say that it admits of no
              possible chance for fraud.

            Mr. OSBORN interposed. Any person affected by the bill becomes a member of the
              company.

            Mr. PIERCE. Certainly. It does not give the power of organization to capitalists
              exclusively, but to any and all persons. A number of my constituents, supposing that
              there was the possibility of injustice in this bill, sent down a man to examine it;
              and that man, who is an able and trusted citizen, after making his examination,
              assurred me that there is nothing wrong in it. I think, then, that every man who will
              examine the bill will be satisfied of its fairness. The gentlemen from Benton and
              White asks what it is that makes this Government strong? It certainly is not the wet
              lands that have made the country strong-except in the effluvia-that indeed may have
              made some of the people of the country a little shaky. [Laughter.] It has been thought
              that the straightening of the Kankakee River would bring into cultivation a large
              tract of country.

            

            Mr. PIERCE, of Vigo. I would like to ask the gentleman, if our Swamp Land legislation
              has not made some Swamp Land Commissioners pretty strong?

            Mr. PIERCE, of Porter. I suppose it has. But that is no reason that every bill that
              has the words "swamp lands" in it should be defeated. We want the swamp
              lands reclaimed. Their reclamation will increase the taxes of the State. Such an
              examination as I have given of this bill would, I think, secure the vote of any man.
              It provides for appeals by aggrieved parties, and appraisers appointed by the court.
              It provides for assessments of damages as well as for benefits which shall be paid;
              and it secures time to pay assessments; and if there is any injustice in it, I
              can't see it.

            Mr. WILE spoke briefly in favor of the bill before it was brought to the final vote,
              which resulted yeas 59, nays 15 as follows:

             So the bill passed the House of Representatives.

            The House then took a recess till two o'clock. 

          
          

          
            AFTERNOON SESSION.

             The SPEAKER resumed at 2 o'clock P. M.
            

            On motion of Mr. UNDERWOOD, Mr. Stephenson's Insurance bill [H. R. 376] was
              taken up, made the special order for Monday at 3 o'clock P. M.
            
         
          
            SOLDIERS' AND SEAMEN'S HOME.

            On motion of Mr. KERCHEVAL, the bill [S. 246]
              to amend sections 4, 13 and 15 of the act of March 17, 1867, to establish the
              Soldiers' Home, and supplementary to said act, was taken up.

            Mr. JOHNSON, of Marshall, stated that the changes from the act of 1867 were to
              propose to raise the allowance to $2 50 a week for each child in the institution, and
              to give the trustees power to bind out those over fourteen years of age.

            The bill was read the second time and ordered to the engrossment. 

          
          

          
            BURIAL PLACES.

            The bill [S. 64] authorizing voluntary
              associations under the act of February 1855, to acquire title to lands heretofore used
              for burial places, was taken up and read the second time with the committee amendments
              thereto, viz: adding:

            "That in addition thereto such reason quantity of land as the public convenience
              of the neighborhood may require for burial purposes."

            The amendment was concurred in.

            On motion of Mr. ZOLLERS, the bill [S. 286]
              supplementary to the act incorporating the Franklin Insurance Company, approved
              February 13, 1861, authoring said Company to change its place of business crease its
              capital stock and contract for and receive the rate of interest established by law,
              was taken up and read the second time.

            On motion of Mr. ZOLLARS, the constitutional restriction was removed for the passage
              of the above recited bills and three others-yeas 70, nays 0.

            Mr. MITCHELL desired to enter hrs motion to reconsider the vote of Thursday by which
              the Chapman Temperance bill was passed the House, and the entry was ordered
              accordingly. 

          
          

          
            SOLDIERS AND SEAMENS HOME.

            The bill [S. 246] to amend the Soldiers Home
              act of 1867 was taken up under the above suspension.

            Mr. PIERCE, of Porter, proposed to amend by inserting the words, "and shall also
              elect a Steward and Matron."

            Mr. BARRITT proposed to amend the amendment by striking from the bill "$2
              50" for weekly allowance for the orphans, and inserting "$2 00" in
              lieu.

            Mr. PIERCE, of Porter, moved ineffectually to lay Mr. Barritt's amendment on the
              table-yeas 22, nays 48.

            Mr. MONROE, explaining, that $2 00 a week ought to be sufficient.

            Mr. GREENE showed, by comparison with the similar allowances in Michigan and
              Pennsylvania, that $2 50 can not be too much.

            Mr. BARRITT insisted that $2 00 a week for each child would be sufficient.

            Mr. STEWART, of Rush, had thought $2 50 was not too much; but he was now willing to
              compromise on $2 00.

            Mr. MONROE would not be understood as opposed to the interests of the Home. He would
              support it; and opposed only what he regarded as an extravagance.

            Mr. COX thought gentlemen had suddenly become morbidly economical-higgling over a
              half dollar a week for the support of soldiers' children! Two dollars a week to
              feed, clothe and educate the children of our soldiers that fell in battle! It was a
              very meagre allowence. He represented a constituency willing to provide  for the widows and children of our fallen soldiers.

            Mr. PIERCE, of Porter. If we are going to economize in anything, it certainly should
              not be in this. He did not think it wise to stint those worthy persons in whose care
              we have placed this Home.

            Mr. BRECKINRIDGE hoped the House would be satisfied with this amendment. He supposed
              that half the laboring men in his region earn not more than $10 per week for the
              support of their families - which was not more than this average of $2 a week apiece
              for these children.

            Mr. JOHNSON, of Marshall, said this bill had the careful consideration and
              recommondation of the committee, and he would not be satisfied with a reduction of
              this allowance below $2 50.

            Mr. STANTON suggested that the terms of the bill require, not that this $2 50 per
              hall be expended, but only so much of it as may be necessary.

            Mr. SHOAFF sustained the amendment, satisfied that it would be sufficient. It was
              more than $12 a week to a family of six persons.

            Mr. WELBORN demanded the previous question, and under its pressure, Mr. Baretts
              amendment was adopted - yeas 47, nays 70.

            The amendment as amended, was then ordered to be engrossed, and the will was read the
              third time as ammended, and finally passed the House of Representatives - yeas 52,
              nays 30. 

          
          

          
            BURIAL PLACES.

            The bill, (S. 64) authorizing voluntary
              associations organized, etc., to acquire title to lands that have heretofore been used
              as burial places, was taken up under the foregoing dispensation of the constitutional
              restriction, the amendments just adopted were ordered to be engrossed, and the bill,
              as amended, was read the third time and finally passed the House of Representatives -
              yeas 68, nays 0. 

          
          

          
            FRANKLIN INSURANCE COMPANY.

            The bill [S. 286] supplementary to the charter
              of the Franklin insurance company, approved February 13, 1841, authorizing said
              company to change its place of business, to increase its capital stock, and to
              contract for and receive the rate of interest established by law, was taken up, under
              the aforesaid suspension, read the third time, and finally passed the House of
              Representatives - yeas 68, nays 0. 

          
          

          
            RAILROAD DIRECTORS.

            The bill [S. 239] authorizing the
              classification of the boards of directors of railroad companies (to go out one or so
              every year), was taken up under the aforesaid suspension, read the second time by
              title, and the third time by sections, and finally passed the House of Representatives
              - yeas 68, nays 1. 

          
          

          
            PARTITION.

            The bill [S. 51] to amend section 9 and repeal
              part of section 16 of the act concerning the partition of real estate, approved May
              20, 1852, was taken up under the same suspension.

            Mr. LONG explained that it merely gives the Court the right to order sale without
              appointing commissioners to sit and report upon partition where the proof is
              sufficient that the land can not be divided.

            The bill was twice read, and finally passed the House - yeas 67, nays 1.

            Mr. Ruddell's bill [H. R. 274] to authorize the issuance of arms and equipments
              to regularly organized military companies was taken up under the same suspension, read
              the third time, and failled in the House of Representatives-yeas 44, nays 25for lack
              of a Constitutional majority of fifty-one.

            Mr. DAVIS, of Elkhart, moved, ineffectually, for a suspension of the constitutional
              restriction to admit of the final consideration of the bills [S. 249, 352] and [H. R.
              380, 355].

            Mr. TEBBS explained that his bill [H. R. 380] relates to the condemning of land for
              sites for school houses. 

          
          

          
            THE FISH LADDER BILL.

            Mr. DAVIS, of Elkhart, said: The bill [S. 249] proposes to construct and keep up at
              every dam across the streams of water in the State fish ladders, or bridges, by means
              of which fish can enter our streams. Fish ladders are constructed in this country and
              in Europe. They are known as salmon ladders. We have spent a great deal of time in
              fish legislation, and it is no new thing to legislate for the protection of fish. But
              how much cheaper would it be to open to our great fish reservoirs a line by which fish
              would come to us in such numbers that they would need no protection. Such a thing is
              practicable. And the expense of of erecting these dam-brides or ladders (whatever they
              may be termed) is but trifling-vaaying from $5 to $25-in proportion to the volume of
              water and the hight of the dam; and it works no risk to the dam. It is simply an easy,
              cheap way of making a road from our great fish reservoirs up to the highest lakes and
              springs of the land; and it will supply the whole country with fish-

            But the House refused to suspend for the consideration of these bills.

            On motion of Mr. MITCHELL, the Senate amendments to Mr. Dittemore's Court bill
              [H. R. 302] were taken up and concurred in.

            On motion by Mr. COFFROTH, the  Senate
              amendments to Mr. Smith's Court bill [H. R.
                11] were taken up and concurred in, with an amendment of title: "To fix
              the time of holding courts in the llth Judicial Circuit," etc.

            On motion of Mr. DAVIS, of Elkhart, the fish ladder bill was [S. 249] was taken up
              and passed to the second reading.

            On motion of Mr. Lamborn, the Common Pleas Court bill [S. 352] was passed to the
              second reading.

            Mr. Stephenson's Supreme Court Clerk index bill (H. R. 392) was ordered to the
              engrossment.

            Mr. Hall's Side-walks bill (H. R. 355) was ordered to be engrossed.

            On motion of Mr. WILLIAMS, of Knox, the bills ( S.
                146, 202 and 203) were advanced one step in the calendar and referred.

            Mr. RUDDELL asked and obtained unanimous consent to introduce a bill (H. R. 394) to
              enable cities to aid in the construction of railroads-terminating in or running
              through such cities, and to all railroads that may connect or consolidate with them
              subject to the limitations and restrictions of the general city corporation act of
              March 14, 1867.

            It was referred to the Committee on Railroads.

            The House then adjourned till Monday morning 9 o'clock. 

          
          


          

            Mr. CRAVENS submitted the following report: (which should appear on page 186.)

            Report of the Special Committee of the Senate on the Question of Privilege between
              the two Houses, concerning the reception of Messages from the Senate, on the part of
              the House.

            MR. PRESIDENT - The Special Committee to which
              was referred the response of the House of Representatives to the resolution of the
              Senate on the subject of the reception or exchange of message, has had the same under
              consideration, and directs me to make the following report.

            Your committee beg leave to say that the resolution of the Senate, based as it was
              upon the communication of the Principal Secretary, that "The Speaker of the House
              having given direction to the Doorkeeper of the House not to announce message from the
              Senate while a member of the House has the floor for debate and in the reception of
              reports," though decided in its character and positive in its terms, could only
              be regarded as the expression of the Senate that the instruction of the Speaker was an
              infraction of the parliamentary rule in relation to the reception of messages, and an
              invitation to the House to return to the established usage in regard to this high and
              ancient privilege.

            Assuming the communication to be true, and the Senate could not otherwise treat a
              plain statement by its confidential officer, the resolution adopted and communicated
              to the House was a request to the House to adhere to a well-known custom, or to inform
              the Senate if any attempt had been made to modify such usage. 

            To this resolution the House of Representatives responded "that the
              communication of Mr. O. M. Wilson, Secretary of the Senate, to that honorable body,
              and upon which said proceedings were had, is wholly untrue.

            "The House, through its committee, further says:"

            Your committee find that the Speak gave no such directions; but that, after the
              secretary of the Senate had, on several occasions, interrupted members of the House
              while engaged in brief debate, in order to present messages of the Senate, and after
              complaint and remonstrance had been ma against such interruptions, the Speaker of House directed the Doorkeeper that, when it was evident to him that a
                member engaged in debate would only occupy the floor for a minute or two of time, he
                should not be interrupted, but that if it was evident that any considerable time
                would be occupied by the member in addressing the House, the Doorkeeper should
                promptly announce the message from the Senate."The House, through its
              committee, adds: "Your committee are of the opinion that the said direction of
              the Speaker was extending to the Senate, in the prompt reception of its messages, a
              greater and more respectful courtesy than parliamentary law and usage
              prescribe."

            Your committee made several ineffectual efforts to have a meeting, with a view in
              inquire into the question of the "frequent interruptions of the House by the
              Secretary of the Senate to present messages." Failing in securing a meeting and
              the attendance of witnesses, your committee conversed freely with officers and members
              of the House, and find that the charge of interruption, as stated, was not such as to
              warrant the severe reflection on the Secretary as expressed by the House Committee
              report. It was not intended, as your committee is informed by those who had an agency
              in giving expression to the House report, to affirm that the Secretary at any time
              delivered a Senate message without being first anounced by the proper officer of the
              House. Hence the cause of complaint, if any exist, was not with the Secretary of the
              Senate, but with the proper officer or usher of the House. But your committee does not
              censure that officer, and only alludes to the fact in vindication of the messenger of
              this body. On the contrary, with the evidence before them, it is the opinion of your
              committee that the Doorkeeper of the House only discharged a duty imposed upon him by
              the office he held. Whether the manner in which he discharged that duty was in
              accordance with the views of propriety entertained by the House, your committee will
              not undertake to decide. Why the House should remonstrate and complain when the
              Secretary only presented his messages after he had been announced by the proper
              officer your committee will not undertake to determine, but fail to appreciate the
              logic by which the censure is imposed. 

            

            In support of the propriety of the instructions given by the Speaker of the House to
              the Doorkeeper of that body, the House committee cites a paragraph from
              "Cushing's Law of Legislative Assemblies," as follows: "But in the
              House to which a message is sent, it is the practice to suspend or discontinue the
              business in hand as soon as may be after the message is announced, so as not
              unnecessarily to detain the messenger. But if a member happens to be speaking at the
              time the messengers attend, it is not usual to receive them until the member has
              resumed his seat; but as this in some cases might amount to a very long detention, it
              is competent for the Speaker to interrupt the member speaking, or to interrupt a
              member in presenting a petition, to receive a message." But all of this authority
              and discretion the Speaker seems to have transferred to the Doorkeeper, with
              limitations upon its exercise. But the House Committee cautiously omitted the
              following sentence, which in the authority quoted as above, occurs between the
              sentences so quoted: "Where the House is in a Committee of the Whole, when a
              message is sent to it, the Committee rises and the House is resumed for the purpose of
              receiving the message; so, when the House is engaged in debate, the business is
              suspended, without formal adjournment of the debate, and the message is
              received."

            To refuse to receive a messenger; to interrupt him in the discharge of his duties;
              unnecessarily to detain him and the message of which he is the bearer; or to confer
              upon a subordinate officer of either House the discretion to determine when or in what
              manner a message should be received, have been pronounced by standard authority
              (Husband's Collections) "a high breach of the privileges of
              Parliament." May, in his work entitled "Law privileges and proceedings of
              Parliament," attaches great importance to message between the Houses as a high
              privilege," and says: "A question is also liable to casual interruption and
              postponement from various causes, and among those a message from the other
              House." John Hatsell, in his celebrated work, "Precedents of proceedings in
              the House of Commons," publihsed in 1785, says, page 26 vol. 3: "The
              admission of messengers from the House of Lords is so much a matter of course that we
              find, on the 15th of February, 1743, they were received in the middle of a debate, and
              the Speaker reported the message and an answer was sent to the Lords" and all
              this without a formal adjournment of the debate." In a note to this paragraph,
              the same author adds, "It would be for the mutual convenience of both Houses, if
              this proceeding was adopted, and the messages from either House to the other were
              admitted at all times; it is a civility due to each other, and would be no
              interruption to public business." The prompt reception of messages, and at all
              times, has been so much a matter of course, that any interruption or qualification of
              it is esteemed a breach of privilege and an infraction of the civilities that should
              characterize the necessary intercourse between the Houses. So highly is the observance
              of this courtesy regarded that the Senate of the United Statea long since adopted, and
              still pursues, the following note, No. 46:" Messengers maybe introduced in any
              state of business, except while a question is putting, while the yeas and nays are
              calling, or while the ballots are counting." So in the House of Representatives
              of the United States. It is the practice of the House to receive messages promptly
              upon the appearance of the messenger, and without regard to the business in hand, and
              a call of the yeas and nays is not unfrequently suspended for the same purpose."
              (Barclay's Digest, page 128.) Other authorities might be adduced in support of
              the view herein expressed, but their multiplication would be unnecessary to maintain a
              proposition now so universally recognized. The necessity for rigid adherence to the
              established usage, is noticed in the fact that legislation is more extensively and
              more rapidly transacted than in former times, and hence the communications from one
              house to the other necessarily grow more frequent. The House committee refers to the
              action of the Senate in 1865 on this subject as more "stringent than the rule
              contemplated by the House." The action referred to has not been repeated or
              adopted by any subsequent session of the Senate, and can only be regarded by your
              committee as an infraction of the well established law on this subject. Whether the
              Senate resolution requesting the House to receive messages of the Senate according to
              the usages of Parliamentary law, was expressed in language sufficiently courteous or
              not, founded as it was upon the statement of the Secretary, the House committee has
              relieved your committee from all embarrassment in deciding; for that committee frankly
              admits that the Speaker directed the door-keeper of the House, substantially, as
              stated by the Secretary. Being true, as stated, and the Senate could presume nothing
              else, the request made of the House can not be deemed "discourteous" or
              "disrespectful." Neither would your committee recommend a concurrence in the
              resolution of the House that the Senate will mete out to said subordinate officer such
              punishment as may be proper in the premises, for, from the admissions of the House
              committee, that the Speaker instructed the Doorkeeper, as reported to the Senate by
              the Secretary, your committee is of the opinion that the Secretary of the Senate has
              not been guilty of any offense, and is, therefore, not deserving of any censure or
              punishment.

            
              JOHN K. CRAVENS, Chairman T. N. RICE, THOS.
                GIFFORD, Committee. 
            

          
          
          
          
        
        

        
          IN SENATE.
          
             MONDAY, May 10, 1869.
          

          The Senate met at 10 o'clock A. M., President pro tem John R. Cravens in the chair.

          

          On motion of Mr. JAQUESS the reading of the Secretary's minutes of Saturday was
            dispensed with.

          On motion of Mr. KINLEY the Senate proceeded to the consideration of House bills on the
            first reading; and, accordingly, the following described bills were read the first time
            and severally passed to the second reading:

          On motion by Mr. GREEN, the Constitutional restriction was suspended, the bill was read
            by title only and referred to the Committee on Corporations.

          On motion by Mr. JAQUESS the House amendments the Soldiers' Home bill [S. 246] were concurred in. 

          
            OWEN'S GEOLOGICAL CABINET

            The House concurrent resolution concerning the appropriation of $20,000 for the
              purchase of Dr. D.D. Owen's geological cabinet being read -

            Mr. WOLCOTT moved to amend by reducing the appropriation to $10,000, for the reason
              that such cabinets have very little market value, though collected at great expense of
              time and labor. The Senator from Monroe stated last session that it had been offered
              to the State University for $10,000, and the present State Geologist knew of its
              having been offered for $16,000. Then a sister State has paid but $3,000 for one
              probably as good.

            Mr. FISHER said that the widow of Dr. Owen would rather sell it for $16,000 and have
              it retained in the State than to sell it for $20,000 and have it removed out of the
              State, and that she had been offered the latter sum from parties outside of the
              State.

            Mr. JAQUESS understood that this cabinet could be bought for $16,666, but thought it
              better to pass the resolution as it is it embracing the items of expense incident to
              the removal of this cabinet.

            Mr. CARSON said the appropriation of such a large sum was a proper subject for the
              consideration of a committee, and he moved to refer the resolution and Amendment to
              the Committee on Finance.

            Mr. FISHER thought the reference unnecessary; that committee knows nothing about this
              cabinet, except from rumor.

            Mr. CARSON said the committee should consider the ability of the State to make this
              appropriation, the necessity of it, and its propriety.

            Mr. MORGAN regarded this as one of the most valuable cabinets in the country,
              embracing some 84,000 collections. He saw no necessity of sending this resolution to a
              committee, and was very much in favor of the appropriation.

            Mr. WOOD suggested that there was no place about the State buildings in which to put
              this cabinet, and gave that as one additional subject for the consideration of the
              committee.

            Mr. WOLCOTT noticed that there is no mention made in the resolution about the
              furniture of the cabinet the scales, drawers, cases, etc. He had no doubt this is a
              very valuable cabinet, but knew from general observation that geological cabinets are
              not valuable property. Looking at such a purchase, however, in a favorable light, he
              would consent to an advance on his own proposition of $6,000; and so proposed to amend
              it.

            Mr. Carson's motion was agreed to, and the resolution and amendments were accordingly referred to the Committee on
                Finance.

            The bill [H. R. 80] declaring what evidence shall be sufficient to establish title,
                prima facie, under a Sheriff's sale
              on execution, was read the first time and passed to a second reading. 

          
          

          
            TAX TITLES.

            The bill [H.R. 136] to create a lien on real estate sold for taxes by the County
              Treasurer, in favor of the purchaser, being read the first time -

            On motion by Mr. FISHER, the Constitutional restriction was suspended, and the bill
              was read by title, so that it might be referred to the Committee on County
                and Township Business.

            Mr. BRADLEY moved to instruct the Committee to strike out the "fifty" per
              cent. penalty, and insert in lieu thereof "twelve."

            Mr. FISHER resisted the motion. Men who are borrowing money, frequently refuse to pay
              taxes because, at the end of two years, they can bring on suit and recover their land
              by paying the purchaser only six per cent. interest on the money paid at the tax sale;
              consequently we have such large delinquent lists all over the State. In order to
              remedy this evil he desired to see the bill passed.

            Mr. GREEN regarded this as a very important bill, intended to remedy a great evil,
              and he opposed the instructions submitted by Mr. Bradley.

            Mr. CARSON did not wish to see this bill passed, because its effect would be to put
              the poor men of the State in the hands of the money sharks. Necessity alone compels
              the poor man to let his land go delinquent.

            Mr. BRADLEY was not opposed to any law that would facilitate the collection of taxes,
              but would much prefer a statue of limitation - say three, four or even six years.

            Mr. BIRD opposed the passage of the bill. The present law is plenty good enough, if
              properly enforced. The only thing that might be done would probably be to extend the
              time for the collection of delinquent taxes. You want to give the collector time
              enough, and the present law is good enough.

            Mr. GREEN insisted that this bill was only driving at the technicalities of the law
              unjustly taken advantage of by those who purposely allow their lands to be sold for
              delinquent taxes.

            Then came the recess till 2 o'clock. 

          
          

          
            AFTERNOON SESSION.

            Mr. WOLCOTT called up the special order for this hour - being the consideration of
              the specific appropriation bill [H. R. 311] in
                Committee of the Whole; and, thereupon, the Senate resolved
              itself into a Committee of the Whole, Mr. GIFFORD in the Chair.

            On motion by Mr. CARSON, it was ordered that the bill be read and adopted by
              sections.

            Sections 1, 2, 3 and 4 having been adopted, and section 5 having been read Mr. FISHER
              said the committee saw no justice in erecting a monument to Governors Wiliard and
              Jeimings and General P. A. Hackleman, and not to Governors Wright, Noble, Whitcomb and
              others. He therefore moved to concur in the Committee amendment striking out this
              section.

            Mr. RICE paid a feeling compliment to the memory of Governor Wright, a former citizen
              of his county. As the present Governor has recommended such an appropriation, he felt
              that he would like to see the I section amended so as to provide for a life-sized
              portrait of all our Ex-Governors to be placed in the State Library. 

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR hoped the Senate would leave the appropriation for a monument
              to General Hackleman stand. That soldier died poor, and this I would be a fitting
              tribute. Mr. HANNA suggested that a monument be erected in the Governor's Circle
              on I which maybe inscribed the names of the ex-Governors. He inquired why General
              Hackleman was singled out from among our departed heroes?

            Mr. FISHER said it was because he was | the only general officer who fell in the
              field.

            The committee amendment was agreed to.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR moved to insert a section appropriating $1,000 for the
              erection of a monument to the late P. A. Hackleman, in lieu of the section stricken
              out.

            Mr. HANNA could riot see why this soldier-though a relative of his-should be singled
              out in this way, and he could not vote for the amendment. He moved to amend by adding
              an additional thousand dollars for a monument to the late Colonel Neff of Sullivan
              county.

            Mr. BRADLEY moved to further amend by adding $1,000 for a monument to Colonel Gilbert
              Hathaway of Laporte county.

            Mr. CARSON moved to add $5,000 for the erection of a monument to General Anthony
              Wayne on the old fort grounds in the city of Fort Wayne. 

            Mr. BELLAMY objected to these amendments proposing appropriations for monuments to
              colonels.

            Mr. RICE offered a substitute authorizing life-like portraits of all Ex-Governors to
              be placed in the State Library-appropriating not exceeding $200 for each. The memory
              of these brave military leaders are  embalmed in
              the heart of every man that lives and moves and has a patriotic heart. Every man of
              Indiana, for all time, will like to look upon the portraits of the men who have
              governed the destinies of this State every four years, and he hoped his substitute
              would be adopted.

            Mr. LASALLE moved to amend by adding the words "and Territory" after the
              word "State."

            Mr. RICE accepted this amendment.

            The substitute was adopted.

            Section 10, appropriating $57 75 for taking care of horses for the General Government
              in 1863, being read-

            Mr. BRADLEY moved to strike it out it being a claim against the General
              Government.

            Mr. FISHER regarded it as a similar claim to many that have been allowed by the
              State.

            Mr. HANNA insisted that we should not allow claims against the General
              Government.

            Mr. CRAVENS knew the claimant to be a reputable citizen of his county.

            The motion to strike out was agreed to.

            Section 19 being read-

            The committee amendment reducing the sum of $32 for a Registry book, to $23 04 was
              agreed to.

            Section 20 being read-

            The Committee amendment substituting $16 92 for $23 for printing 750 yeas and nays,
              was agreed to.

            Section 21 being read-

            The Committee amendment striking out $24 and inserting $17 28 for a book Register of
              bills, having been read-

            Mr. TURNER said the Committee was satisfied that all these bills were 30 per cent,
              too high, and ordered their clerk to make the reduction.

            The amendment was agreed to.

            Section 22 being read-

            The Committee amendment striking out $36 25 and inserting $26 10 in lieu, was agreed
              to.

            Section 23 reimbursing $1,200 to the contingent fund was stricken from the bill on
              motion by Mr. BRADLEY.

            Section 26 allowing the State Printer $7,455 13 for extra work done on the Adjutant
              General's Report, being read-

            Mr. HOOPER moved to strike it out. This work was printed under a contract, and he saw
              no good foundation for this claim.

            Mr. CARSON thought we should not allow contractors to come in here in this way and
              claim extra pay. Especially in this work the Legislature was entirely over
              reached.

            Mr. GRAY and Mr. BELLAMY explained that in order to avoid making fifteen or twenty
              volumes the type was changed from large to smaller, which made composition.

            Mr. HANNA had taken the look into this matter and explained the change from brevier
              to nonpariel type. Several volumes contained an excess of number of pages required by
              the contract, and this claim is for the excess.

            Mr. HUMPHYEYS moved to reduce this amount 30 per cent.-the same reduction that has
              been made in the Printer's other bills.

             Mr. FISHER said if the original contract had been lived up to strictly we would have
              had sixteen volumes instead of eight and the State would have had to pay $70 000 or
              $80,000 more for this work. He though-the amount should be allowed. 

            Mr. CHURCH and Mr. GREEN were satisfied that the claim should be paid m Mr. HOOPER
              still believed that the section should be struck out.

             Mr. TURNER favored Mr. Huffman's amendment allowing $5,220 instead of $7,455,
              because he thought the 30 per cent deduction was about right for all bills coming from
              that printing establishment.

            Mr. SHERROD could not believe that the public printer would make so large a charge
              erroneously, and hoped the amendment would be withdrawn. Let the section be
              adopted.

            Mr. GRAY understanding that the work was done under an open contract, and that the
              House Committee had cut down the claim about 30 per cent(from upwards of $9,000)he
              thought this claim about fair.

            Mr. FOSDICK had heard no one complain of the injustice of this claim, and if it be
              just it should be allowed.

            Mr. HUMPHREYS recited the history of the order for the printing of this report, which
              has already cost the State about $80,000. He could not tell whether this claim is just
              or not, but it certainly should be examined very closely before allowed.

            Mr. HAMILTON thought the State had been saved some $60,000 by the change talked of,
              and acknowledged here to have been made. 

            On motion by Mr. WOLCOTT, the amendment was rejected.

            The motion to strike out the section was also rejected.

            The section was then adopted.

            Section 27, allowing $2,000 to Jonathan S. Harvey, late Treasurer of State service,
              being read-

            Mr. CARSON moved to strike it out.

            Mr. WOLCOTT read from Mr. Harvey's itemized account, and explained its
              correctness.

            Mr. CARSON regarded this as a claim belonging not to the State of Indiana, opposed
              its allowance.

            

            Mr. ROBINSON, of Madison, presented papers to prove the justness of the claim. 

            The motion to strike out was rejected.

            The section was adopted.

            Section 59 being read, allowing $843 42 the city of Indianapolis for constructing a
              sidewalk around the Governor's Circle -

            Mr. CARSON made an ineffectual motion to strike it out.

            The section recommended by the Committee on Finance, allowing
              Talbott & Costigan $7,501.34 for articles used in building the State Prison North,
              being read-

            Mr. FISHER moved to strike it out, and he showed that these contractors should not be
              allowed this claim-reciting many facts concerning their connection with the
              construction of the Northern Prison.

            Mr. BRADLEY knew nothing of the matter of fraud referred to by the Senator from
              Wabash (Mr. Fisher). He read papers signed by members of former Legislatures, and made
              statements founded on undisputed authority, to convince Senators that the claim is
              just and ought to be allowed.

            Mr. HOOPER stated that no minority report from the Committee on
                Claims was presented on this claim because he did not notice when the
              majority report was made-although he watched for it.

            Mr. WOLCOTT and Mr. FISHER said, although this amendment appears as coming from the
                Committee on Finance, that Committee does not endorse it. It was
              referred to that Committee by the Committee on Claims, with
              instructions to report it in this bill, and that accounts for its appearance here in
              this connection.

            After further remarks by Mr. ROBINSON, of Madison, Mr. BRADLEY, and Mr. CRAVENS-

            The motion to strike out was rejected.

            The section was adopted. And then, on motion by Mr. BRADLEY, the Committee rose,
              reported progress, and asked leave to sit again.

            The Chairman reported as directed, and the report was concurred in.

            Mr. CRAVENS, from the special committee thereon, returned the Morgan Raids Raids bill
              [H. R. 119], recommending its passage in a written report, reciting at length reasons
              why the bill should become a law.

            Mr. HOOPER moved that the Senate adjourn.

            The motion was rejected by yeas 20, nays 25.

            Mr. FISHER opposed the passage of the bill. He read authorities to prove the
              correctness of his statement made the other day, that the General Government had
              reimbursed the State of Ohio only for damages done by the United States troops: - for
              expenses incurred in repelling the raid. He was unwilling that a deception should be
              practised here in order to secure the passage of this bill. He defied any Senator to
              produce an instance in the world's history where a government has paid for
              damages done to private property by a common enemy.

            Mr. HOOPER regretted that there is a disposition manifested to pass through a measure
              of so much importance as this in such haste. This bill proposes to appropriate
              $413,000a sum that will certainly reach the bottom of the Treasury unless a further
              levy is made on the people of the State in the shape of taxes. He could not see why
              claims against the General Government should be fastened on the State; and, so far as
              the other classes of claims are concerned, they have no right in justice or in law to
              demand payment by the State. And whenever you depart from this and go outside of law
              to allow claims you enter upon dangerous ground.

            Mr. HANNA argued that the failure of the State authorities to protect the property of
              these claimants laid the whole people of the State liable to bear the burdens to pay
              for its destruction-because when the people of the State put those in authority who
              failed to discharge their duty the whole people of the State are responsible for the
              failure.

            Mr. GRAY, while extending his sympathy to the claimants, did not think this a just
              claim against the State of Indiana. He regarded reflection against the State
              authorities in this connection as having no foundation in fact.

            Mr. CARSON made an ineffectual motion to adjourn.

            Mr. TURNER demanded the previous question.

            The demand was sustained by the Senate-upon a division-affirmative 24, negative
              17-and-

            Under its pressure the report of the Committee was rejected, by yeas 23, nays
              24-follows:

            
              
                
                  YEAS-Messrs. Andrews, Bellamy, Bird, Bradley, Church,
                    Cravens, Denbo, Grifford, Green, Hanna, Henderson, Howk, Huey, Huffman,
                    Humphreys, Laselle, Lee, Montgomery, Bice, Robinson of Madison, Sherrod, Taggart
                    and Turner-23.

                  NAYS-Messrs. Beardsley, Carson, Case, Caren, Eliott, Fisher,
                    Fosdick, dray, Hadley, Hamilton, Hess, Hooper, Jaquess, Johnson of Spencer,
                    Kinley, Morgan, Reynolds, Robinson of Decatur, Scott, Smith, Stein, Wolcott,
                    Wood, and the Lieutenant Governor-24.
                
              
            

            Pending the roll-call-

            Mr. CARSON, when his name was called, said that this report was untrue in law, and
              false in fact.

            Mr. CRAVENS, in explanation, disclaimed any personal or party allusion in his
              report,it was but the simple announcement of a general proposition. 

            

            Mr. FISHER spoke knowingly when he declared that there was an organised regiment of
              men in every border county at the time of this raid, but the difficulty was they had
              no horses, and therefore could not catch Morgan.

            Mr. GREEN did not like the language of the report very well.

            Mr. HAMILTON was not prepared to endorse the language of the report.

            Mr. HUMPHREYS, by his vote would not commit himself for the bill.

            Mr. RICE disclaimed any intention in the report to strike at the officials of the
              State at the time of this raid.

            Mr. ROBINSON, of Madison, thought the bill should not be passed without some
              amendment, and consequently regretted that the demand for the previous question had
              been seconded.

            Mr. STEIN had been resting under the delusion that the State of Ohio had been
              reimbursed by the General Government for claims similar to these, but under the light
              thrown upon that question this afternoon he would not take the risk of voting for this
              bill.

            Mr. WOLCOTT believed this report to be untrue in law and false in its deductions of
              facts.

            Mr. WOOD voted "no" without indicating how he should vote on the bill.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR, in explanation of his vote, said: If the Chair should be
              called upon to vote on the bill I should vote "aye," for I believe the bill
              is right; but I do not believe the statements in this report are true; and I can not
              give my vote to concur in a report that casts censure upon the Governor of the State,
              I therefore vote "no."

            So the report was rejected

            And then the Senate adjourned. 

          
          

        
        

        
          HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.

          The House met at 9 o'clock A. M., and the reading of the
            journal of yesterday having been dispensed with- 

          
            THE WILL CASE BILL.

            On motion of Mr. COFFROTH, the House took up the special order, viz.: the
              consideration of the bill [S. 255] to save
              pending cases affected by the act of 1865 to repeal sections 43 and 44 of the act of
              1852, (similar to Mr. Dittemore's Will Case bill [H. R. 235],) the same being on
              the third and last reading; and on his farther motion, the special order was postponed
              till 11 o'clock, A. M.
            

          
          

          
            THE CALENDAR.

            On motion of Mr. WELBORN, it was ordered that the House proceed to the consideration
              of bills on the third reading. 

          
          

          
            ROAD LAW.

            Mr. Dunn's bill [H. R. 125] to amend A act to amend the forty-fifth section of
              the road act of March 5, 1857, was read the third time.

            Mr. DUNN explained, that by the law 1865, any person might come before the County
              Commissioners and show road has been used for twenty years a I obtain an order to open
              it. This bill proposes that the party shall first give notice to parties interested
              along the road.

            The bill was finally passed the House-yeas 64, nays 4: 

          
          

          
            DRAFTS ON COUNTY TREASURERS.

            Mr. Mitchell's bill [H. R. 159], to amend section 16 of the act to authorize and
              limit allowances made by courts, and drafts on County Treasurers, approved May
              27,1852, was read the third time, and finally passed the House of Representatives-yeas
              67, nays 0.

            The House then took up the consideration of bills from the Senate on the first
              reading, and the bills [S. 253] to enable Criminal Courts to try certain forfeited
              recognizances, the bill [S. 253] to authorize Criminal Courts for the counties of
              Laporte and St. Joseph, the bill [S. 348] to provide that towns with a vacant public
              lot of ground may donate the same to public common school purposes, were severally
              read the first time and referred. 

          
          

          
            SOLDIERS AND SEAMEN'S HOME.

            The Senate concurrent resolution to authorize the Trustees and officers of the
              Soldiers' Home to transfer the inmates (by their voluntary consent) to the
              National Home at Dayton, Ohio, or Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and to receive no more except
              in extreme cases, was taken up.

            Mr. DAVIS of Elkhart proposed to add "the Home at Augusta, Maine."

            Mr. WILLIAMS of Knox proposed to amend further by striking out the words "by
              their voluntary consent."

            Mr. DAVIS of Elkhart moved to lay Mr. Williams' motion on the table, which was
              not agreed to-yeas 30, nays 32, Mr. Davis of Elkhart explaining that in his
              judging-these soldiers had been marching under orders long enough; they should be free
              to go or stay, and Mr. Kercheval said if this amendment were adopted he would vote
              against the resolution.

            The question recurring on the adoption of Mr. Williams' amendment-

            Mr. GREENE said there were now in the "Home" some half-a-dozen soldiers the
              last days of consumption, and could not be removed with safety. They should be
              permitted to die in their own State, whose defense has cost them so dearly.

            

            Mr. COFFROTH and Mr. DAVIS suggested that the resolution might be amended, so as to
              make exception for the sick. 

            Mr. OSBORN spoke against the proposed amendment, as a proposition to treat these
              fabled soldiers, not as the wards, but as the prisoners of the State. Having placed
              these men there, as their home, we are Stopped from the right to take them away
              without their consent. We should not treat them as soldiers under orders the time
              having passed for them to obey orders. He was not willing to say to them, you shall
              go, or shall do this or that.

            Mr. NEFF said, those National Homes for disabled soldiers have been constructed since
              the Indiana Home was instituted; and he described the munificent arrangements for the
              purpose at Dayton he having been on the committee appointed to visit that institution.
              He could not think it unworthy of the State to send these soldiers where they can have
              superior accommodations, and at a place as much their home, as the Home at
              Knightstown, which the State wants now to convert into an orphan asylum to make
              provision for those orphans of the soldiers who are not provided for by the Government
              of the United States. He recapitulated the superior facilities for solace, employment
              and comfort at the Soldiers' National Home at Dayton.

            Mr. WILLIAMS, of Knox, proposed further to amend by providing an exception for those
              soldiers whose life or health would be endangered by removal.

            Mr. STEWART, of Rush, hoped that the House would not vote to expatriate those
              soldiers from "their Home" and from the State they have defended, and take
              them to another State without their consent expatriate those noble men, without
              imputation of crime, from their Home and the State where they have their wives and
              children about them. He appealed to the sense of honor and humanity against this.

            Mr KERCHEVAL spoke of an understanding with the soldiers at Knightstown, that they
              should not be removed against their consent, and denounced the amendment as a breach
              of faith towards those men, and it was an attempt, he said, to do something which is
              beyond the power of the State Legislature.

            Mr. DAVIS, of Elkhart, explained that he was in favor of the passage of the
              resolution if it be stript of this amendment, which proposed to give it a mandatory
              character. He would have these men free to go or stay. He felt that the property of
              the State is pledged for the support of those disabled men, who stood as a wall of
              fire against an invasion of the life of the nation. They can be moved without the
              mandatory order.

            Mr. WILLIAMS, of Knox, now obtained leave to withdraw the amendment. And then the
              resolution was adopted. 

          
          

          
            BOARDS OF EQUALIZATION.

            Mr. STANTON obtained leave to introduce a bill [H. R. 395] to extend the time of the
              meeting of the County Boards of Equalization (to the first Monday in July), and fixing
              the time for the Auditors to present the abstracts of appraisaments of real
              estate.

            The bills [S. 276, 308, 278, 284 and 293] were
              read the first time and passed to the second reading.

            Mr. OSBORN entered his motion to reconsider the vote of Saturday for the final
              passage of the court bill [H. R. 203.] 

          
          

          
            THE WILL CASE BILL.

            The House then took up the special order, viz: the Will Case bill [S. 255] to save pending cases affected by the act
              of 1865, to repeal sections 43 and 44 of the act of 1852, and it was passed the final
              reading in the House of Representatives-yeas 60, nays 17. Mr. Kercheval voted aye,
              being unwilling to close the Courts of the country to the humblest citizen; and Mr.
              Shoaff voted affirmatively, to right any wrong that is claimed to have been done to
              parties by his vote for the act of 1865. 

          
          

          
            SUPREME COURT INDEX BILL.

            On motion, Mr. Stephenson's bill [H. R. 382], authorising the Clerk of the
              Supreme Court to index the court books, etc., was taken up.

            Mr. STEPHENSON explained its propriety and necessity, and that it would involve but
              little expense to the State.

            Mr. NEFF alleged his opposition to the bill, and the inconsistency of the champion of
              retrenchment in introducing it.

            Mr. STEPHENSON was willing to go before his own and the constituents of the gentleman
              from Putnam on the issue made by that gentleman.

            The bill was rejected-yeas, 33; nays, 44. 

          
          

          
            ORDER FOR THE FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT.

            Mr. UNDERWOOD obtained leave to submit the following:

            
              Resolved, That the consideration of the Fifteenth Amendment to the
              Constitution of the United States, which was made the special order for Tuesday, May
              11, when taken up on that day shall be further postponed till Friday, May 14th, at 2
              1/2 o'clock, and made the special order for that hour.

            Mr. COFFROTH proposed to amend by striking out all after the word "be," and
              insert these words in lieu, "indefinitely postponed."

            Mr. OVERMEYER moved to lay the proposed amendment on the table.

            Mr. COFFROTH demanded the yeas and nays, which resulted-yeas 48, nays 53as
              follows:

                    Cave, Coffroth, Cory, Cotton, Davis of Floyd, Dittemore, Fuller, Hutchings,

             So the amendment was laid on the table, and the question recurred on the adoption of
              the resolution.

            Mr. UNDERWOOD demanded the previous question on the adoption of the resolution, and
              under its operation the vote was taken, resulting-yeas 53, nays 29-as follows:

            
              
                
                  YEAS-Messrs. Admire, Bates, Beeler, Bobo, Breckinridge,
                    Carnahan, Cave, Chapman, Cory, Cunningham, Davidson, Davis of Elkhart, Davis of

                    Tebbs, Underwood, Wile, Williams of Hamilton, Williams of Knox, Williams of
                    Union, Wilson, and Mr. Speaker.-53.

                  NAYS-Messrs. Baker, Beatty, Britton, Calvert, Coffroth,
                    Dunn, Gordon, Johnson of Marshall, Lamborn, Logan, Miller, Miner, Mock, Monroe,
                    Neff, Osborn, Pierce of Porter, Pierce of Vigo, Shoemaker, Stanton, Stewart of
                    Ohio, Vater, Welborn, Wildman, Williams of St. Joseph, and Zollars29.
                
              
            

            Mr. CHAPMAN explaining, said he voted aye for the postponement, because his
              temperance bill was not yet passed.

            Mr. COFFROTH explaining. I am unwilling to give any vote to consider this
              Constitutional amendment till the people of the State shall have first passed upon it.
              I vote no.

            Mr. DAVIS of Floyd, explained. I, too, desire that the Constitutional amendment shall
              not be considered here till the people shall have had an opportunity to pass upon it;
              but, as this resolution does not require us to consider it on Friday, and, as there is
              yet some little business to do, I vote aye.

            Mr. GORDON explaining. I hold that no man has a right to ask me to vote to postpone
              any proposition to a day certain. I am ready to vote on any proposition coming;
              properly before the House now, or when the vote is called-whether I vote for
              or-against it is nobody's business, therefore I vote no.

            Mr. MITCHELL, explaning. I have determined within myself to do everything in my power
              to prevent the 46th General Assembly from passing upon the question of the XVth
              amendment; but for the purpose of prosecuting our business and passing the necessary
              bills of the session I vote "aye."

            Mr. OSBORNE, explaining. I do not believe, sir, that the question as to whether the
              Legislature should consider that Constitutional Amendment ought to interfere with our
              legislation; though I believe we ought to pass that amendment to-morrow and I believe
              the Democratic member' ought to stay and see it done. Therefore I vote
              "no." 

            Mr. PIERCE of Vigo, explaining, referred to the fact that at the close of the last
              session, when the House was composed of the same members, with one exception and when
              this proposition was up; it would be remembered with what remarkable unanimity we of
              the Republican party voted against postponing the consideration of the Constitutional
              Amendment; and, though voting against the postponement himself; he then doubted the
              propriety of refusing to postpone. But now he did not propose to stultify his record
              here by voting further to postpone this question. He voted "no."

            Mr. RUDDELL explaining said: We have had an exhibition of Democratic feeling on this
              subject, and may be well enough satisfied as to how determined they are upon it; and
              we know that by urging this question we shall stop the business o: the session.
              Therefore, I vote "aye."

            Mr. SABIN explaining for the first time. I feel instructed to vote in favor of this
              postponement. My personal feelings are against it. I vote "aye."

            Mr. ZOLLARS explaining for the first time said, he voted "no" on this
              proposition for two very obvious reasons. In the first place, as remarked by the
              gentleman from Marion [Mr. Ruddell] as to the Democratic determination on this floor,
              he considered that hitherto we have been entirely consistent on this question. We
              first proposed to submit it to the people; we next proposed to postpone; and these
              having been refused the rest is told. Individually he had made every effort for night
              sessions, and to pursue business in the regular order; and he had been in favor of all
              questions by which we might have got along with business. For consistency now he voted
              "no."

            So the resolution was adopted.

            Mr. Pierce, of Porter, obtained I present a petition numerously signed by his
              constituents, requesting him to vote and use his influence for the ratification of the
              Constitutional amendment.

            The House then took a recess until 2 o'clock. 

          
          

          

          
            AFTERNOON SESSION.

            On motion of Mr. CARNAHAN (in the absence of the Speaker) Mr. Williams, of Knox, was
              called to the chair.

            Mr. STEWART, of Rush, and Mr. SABIN asked, but could not obtain consent to make
              reports from their Committees. But subsequently the order of business was suspended
              for reports from the Committees generally.

              recommending their passage.

              passage.

            Mr. FAIRCHILD, from the Committee on County and Township Business,
              returned the drainage bill [S. 89] to amend act of 1867, and the substitute therefor,
              recommending the passage of the substitute.

            Mr. MASON returned and recommended the indefinite postponement of the Township Bridge

            The report was concurred in.

              amend the act regulating the fees of officers, etc., recommending its passage.

            Mr. LAMBORN, from the special committee thereon, returned the bills [H. R. 360 and
              363] in relation to divorces, (introduced by Mr. Lamborn and Mr. McGregor)
              recommending their indefinite postponement. The report was concurred in. 
          
            
          
            APPROPRIATION FOR THE SUPREME COURT BUILDING.

            Mr. STANTON, from the special committee thereon, returned the bill [S. 194] making an appropriation for the payment to
              the Sinking Fund of money advanced for the erection of the building for the Supreme
              Court and the State offices, recommending its passage.

            On his further motion (the Constitutional restriction being suspended for the
              purpose) the bill was put upon its final passage.

            It proposes to appropriate $52,101 55 and $4,388 interest.

            The bill was finally passed the House of Representative-yeas 58, nays 17. 

          
          

          
            SPECIFIC BILL FOR THE EXTRA SESSION.

            Mr. STANTON, from the Committee on Ways and Means, (by consent) reported a bill [H.
              R, 396] making specific appropriations for the year 1869; which was recommitted, with
              instructions to insert claims, &c., heretofore adopted by the House, and -
              referred to said committee.

            Mr. STEWART, of Rush, submitted a resolution (which was adopted) directing the
                Committee on Ways and Means to incorporate in the specific bill
              an allowance of $8 each to the members of the Special Committee appointed to visit the
              National. Soldiers' Home at Dayton, Ohio, for extra expenses so incurred by them. 

          
          

          
            THE UNDERWOOD LIFE INSURANCE BILL.

            On motion of Mr. UNDERWOOD, the constitutional restriction was suspended for the
              final consideration of Mr, Stephenson's Insurance bill [H. R. 376], Mr.
              Zollar's County Asylum bill [H. R. 315], and the bill [S. 230] to cut down the
              Governor's rent allowance from $5,000 to $2,500 per annum.

            Mr. Stephenson's bill [H. R. 376] to incorporate Life Insurance Companies, to
              make certain provisions concerning contracts for life insurance with the agents of
              Life Insurance Companies in this State, etc., was taken up and read the second
              time.

            Mr. UNDERWOOD explained its provisions-it was to take the place of his Insurance bill
              [H. R. 60] vetoed by the Governor on the 9th of March.

            The bill was finally passed the House-yeas 52, Hays 25. 

          
          

          
            RESIDENCE FOR THE GOVERNOR.

            The bill [S. 230] to revise and amend section 4 of the act of February 25, 1865,
              appointing commissioners to sell certain real estate therein named, to provide a
              residence for the Governor, etc., was taken up and read under the foregoing
              suspension.

            Mr. PIERCE, of Porter, spoke against the passage of the bill, alleging politics)
              designs in opposition to the Governor, and  the
              constitutional provision that the Governor's compensation shall not be increased
              or diminished during the term for which he shall be elected.

            Mr. PIERCE of Vigo stated the legal salary of the Governor$3,000; and that together
              with his allowance for house ren-these loopholes-gave a large compensation;
              and though it may not be too much this indirection to eke out his compensation was
              most damaging to the party. If $3,000 were not sufficient, it were better to come up
              squarely and increase his salary.

            Mr. STEWART of Rush explained that this $5,000 a year for house rent was allowed to
              Governor Morton when he left the old mansion for the health of his family, and was
              boarding at the Bates House at $90 a week, which is at the rate of $5,000 a year.

            Mr. GORDON took the same view with that submitted by Mr. Pierce of Vigo.

            Mr. BUSKIRK (Mr. Welborne in the Chair) took the floor in opposition to the bill. If
              it were right to allow anything in this bill, it was proper and right to allow a just
              allowance, though it might be better to do it directly. He was of the opinion that the
              present compensation is not too much for the Governor. It was idle to talk about
              raising the salary of the Governor in the face of the Constitution. Having set the
              precedent of the allowance in this way, the amount was nothing for the argument. Give
              the Governor enough and not yield to this suggestion from the Democratic side here to
              reduce the compensation of the Governor, which has been so long received and
              considered on all sides as no more than sufficient. He was opposed to it especially
              because it was a stab at the Governor by those who are politically opposed to him.

            Mr. COFFROTH. If Senator Church, from Porter county, was a Democrat, then this bill
              was originated by a Democrat. The House and the country knew that Senator Church was a
              Republican, and a leading member of the other branch. He (Mr. Coffroth) was here in
              February, 1865, and he alleged and showed that this $5,000 house rent was not intended
              to increase the salary of the Governor, but it was proposed, or so much thereof as may
              be necessary, to provide the 'Governor with a suitable residence. Yet, our honest
              Governor still puts his hand, into the Treasury and draws the full amount of $5,000
              & year. This was appropriated to pay his rent only; and the Governor has been
              Tenting all the time a house for $1,500; and; that was all he ought to draw. He then
              referred to the indignant expression of the House but the other day against the
              corrupt and unfortunate Meredith, and called spon members to consider their duty with
              reference to the proposition before ti, House. When he had concluded-

            Mr. ZOLLARS demanded the previous question, and, under its operation, the Kju was
              finally passed the House of Repretatives-yeas 53, nays 35.

            Mr. Speaker BUSKIRK entered his motion to reconsider this vote.

            Mr. COFFROTH moved to lay that motion on the table.

            Whereupon, the point of order was sprung as to whether the motion to lay on the table
              can be entertained, when th mover of the original motion does not ask for its
              consideration at once, in which Messrs. COFFROTH, SHOAFF GORDON, BUSKIRK and others
              participated.

            Mr. KERCHEVAL moved that the House adjourn, which was decided in the negative-yeas
              23, nays 53.

            Mr. BUSKIRK moved to reconsider the vote on the adjournment.

            Mr. COFFROTH made the point that the motion can not be entertained.The SPEAKER
                pro tem., overruled the point.

            The yeas and nays were then ordered, and the vote was announced, yeas 30, nays 50, so
              the House refused to reconsider.

            Mr. LAMBORN moved that the House do now adjourn.

            The SPEAKER pro tern, decided that the motion can not be entertained, because no
              business has intervened since the former motion to adjourn.

            Mr. BUSKIRK appealed from the decision of the Chair, being joined in the appeal by
              Mr. LAMBORN; and he argued that the motion to adjourn may be repeated, from authority
              read from Barkley's Digest, page 6; when a motion to reconsider, or the reading
              of a paper from the Clerk's desk or an order for the yeas and nays, is held to be
              sufficient to constitute such "inter vening business."

            After debate by Messrs. Gordon, Coffroth and Davis, of Floyd-

            The question: Shall the decision of the Chair stand as the judgment of the House was
              decided in the negative-yeas 15, nap 63.

            Mr. LAMBORN now obtained leave to withdraw the motion to adjourn.

            Mr. BUSKIRK also asked and obtained leave to withdraw his motion to reconsider the
              vote on the passage of the Governor's residence bill [S. 230]

            Mr. COFFROTH then moved to reconsider the final vote on said bill [S. 230,] and moved
              to lay the motion to reconsider o the table.

            The SPEAKER held that the latter motion to lay on the table, could not be
              entertained.

            Mr. COFFROTH appealed from that decision.

            Pending which-the House adjourned. 

          
          
          
          
        
        

        

        
          IN SENATE.
          
             TUESDAY, May 11, 1869.
          

           The Senate met at 9 o'clock A. M.

          On motion of Mr. JOHNSON, of Spencer-the reading of the Secretary's minutes
            yesterday was dispensed with.

          On motion by Mr. HANNA, the lateral railroad bill [S.
              330] was read the third time, and passed the Senate by yeas 37, nays 0.

          Mr. CRAVENS had leave to withdraw report of the special committee on the Morgan Raid
            bill [H. R. 119], submitted yesterday afternoon-the vote thereon being reconsidered for
            that purpose. 

          
            THE SPECIFIC APPROPRIATION BILL.

            On motien by Mr. WOLCOTT, the Senate resolved itself into a Committee of the Whole,
              and resumed the consideration of the Specific Appropriation bill [H. R. 111] - Mr.
              Gifford in the chair.

            The section recommended by the Finance Committee appropriating
              various sums of money to different persons for expenses incurred in defending suits
              instituted against them for arrests made by them, while acting under orders, being
              read -

            Mr. HANNA moved to strike it from the bill for reasons which he gave.

            Mr. FISHER said the section was not here by the action of the Committee - the Senate
              instructed them to report it.

            Mr. HADLEY believed there were claims paramount to these which would exhaust the
              Treasury; and, therefore, favored the motion to strike out.

            Mr. HAMILTON thought it but just to help these men out of the difficulty which
              overtook them in consequence of their obedience to their superior officers.

            Mr. TURNER was satisfied there were thousands of similar claims outstanding, and if
              this precedent were adopted there is no telling where the end will be.

            The motion to strike out was agreed to upon a division of the Senate.

            Mr. WOLCOTT moved to increase the sum allowed in the committee's amendment for
              attorney fees in the case of the State of Indiana v. the Central Canal Company from
              $750 to $1,000.

            Mr. ROBINSON of Madison moved as a substitute that a sum not exceeding $1,000 be
              allowed.

            Mr. CARSON moved to add: or so much as shall be necessary in the opinion of the
              Governor, and declaring that $1,000 shall cover all the attorney's fees in this
              case.

            The amendment was rejected.

            The substitute was adopted.

            The section, as amended, was adopted.

            The section recommended by the committee, allowing J.A. Coburn $31,813 95 for
              settling claims of the State against the United States, being read - 

            Mr. CARSON opposed its adoption. Indiana is supporting a Governor, Adjutant General,
              and other State officers, to take care of her interests, and yet it seems that a clerk
              or agent has to be employed for two months to look after our interests, and to be paid
              for that service more than you pay your Governor, or Senators for six years'
              services in Congress. And what labor did this valuable clerk perform? Can any Senator
              show that he furnished brain, muscle, or labor, or incurred any risk or hazard iv this
              matter?

            Mr. GREEN stated that two per cent, is the lowest that has been allowed by sister
              States for similar service.

            Mr. TURNER regarded this as a claim arising under a duly authorized contract If there
              was any honorable means to get out of the payment of a portion of this sum he was
              willing to do so; but he was not willing to go back upon written contracts made by
              agents of the State.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR read from the Governor's message these words to which he
              called the attention of the Senate:

            "I thereupon consented that the Adjutant General might employ such an agent, at
              a compensation not exceeding two per cent, on the amount which should be allowed to
              and realized by the State through his efforts, but no part of this per centum should
              be paid until it should be acted upon and the arrangenent approved by the General
              Assembly."

            Mr. HOOPER insisted that the responsibility of this matter rested with the General
              Assembly, as evidenced by the words of the Governor just read. The amount allowed
              bears no sort of comparison to the services performed; therefore., he moved to strike
              out $31,000, and insert in lieu $10,000.

            Mr. KINLEY. The very language of the contract distinctly states that it is not to be
              binding until it receives the approval of the General Assembly. He should therefore
              vote for a reduction of the claim.

            Mr. CHURCH was of the opinion that the Legislature should approve what has been done.
              The Adjutant General and the Governor having failed to get this claim through, and
              this agent succeeding in obtaining a settlement-which they could not, he certainly
              should be paid for the service.

            Mr. BRADLEY regarded this compensation as reasonable, compared with what similar
              agents have been paid for similar services, and hence he had come; to the conclusion
              to favor the adoption of the section.

            Mr. CARSON had heard no good reason offered for this enormous allowance made to this
              agent by this proposed section, and the country will fail to see any reason for."
              this-it is inexplicable. The Governor justly throws the responsibility upon the  Legislature to ratify this contract, and the
              Legislature cannot escape from it.

            Mr. STEIN did not see anything novel or peculiar in this matter. This rate is as low
              as prevailed in Washington City for services of this character. We have been compelled
              to resort to an agent, and the Question is whether the compensation proposed is
              exhorbitant or not. In view of all the circumstances he should vote to ratify the
              contract.

            Mr. WOOD insisted that the contract was entered into with the risk of its
              ratification by the Legislature. He understood there were about $3,000,000 of claims
              at the time this contract was made. Now only about half of the claims are adjusted,
              and those probably the easier elass. The eon-tract is not filled, and who knows if
              this allowance is made what we will have to pay for the settlement of the other
              half?

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR regarded it as very clear that there was no contract in the
              case. He was satisfied that this man had not performed any service that he was not
              already paid for by the $1,200 he has received. It is the duty of the Legislature to
              put their seal of condemnation on this way of taking money out of the public
              treasury.

            Mr. CRAVENS regarded the contract as a clear, clean one made by authority of law. The
              amount of the compensation is the thing to be passed upon by the Legislature, and this
              two per cent, being the lowest amount paid for such services, would certainly have
              been the amount allowed by the Legislature if no rate were set forth, in the contract.
              He read the copy of a letter from Governor Morton, saying he would unite in a
              recommendation to the Legislature to pay this rate of two per cent., and insisted that
              the State should not act in bad faith in such matters.

            Mr. RICE favored the full allowance, and regarded its rejection as a piece of bad
              faith on the part of the State.

            Mr. LASELLE regarded this as a proposition to make a gift-simply a gift to this
              gentleman. The Governor denies that he made any contract, but throws its
              responsibility upon the Legislature. He claimed, so far as an equitable view of the
              case is concerned, that this man is not entitled to one cent more than he has
              received, but would be willing to vote him $500 under the peculiar circumstances ef
              the case.

            Mr. HANNA cited the authority for making the appointment of the agent, and declared
              that the contract leaves it for the General Assembly to determine the amount of
              compensation to be allowed. The Governor, having the power to do so, did well in not
              making the compensation absolute in this contract.

            Mr. LASELLE still insisted that th whole matter was open to the action of the General
              Assembly.

            On motion of Mr. HOOPER the Committee rose, reported progress and leave to sit
              again.

            The report was concurred in.

            Then came the recess for dinner. 

          
          

          
            AFTERNOON SESSION.

            Mr. BELLAMY moved to take up the Morgan raid claim bill.

            On motion by Mr. HOOPER this motion was laid on the table. 

    

          
            THE SPECIFIC BILL.

            On motion by Mr. HOOPER the Senate resolved itself into a Committee of the
                Whole-Mr. Gray in the chair-and resumed the consideration of the Specific
              Appropriation bill [H. R. 111.]

            Mr. WOLCOTT thought the rejection of the section under consideration would be casting
              an implied censure upon our chief Executive officer, and disappoint the expectations
              of a worthy citizen who has done the State an important service. He mentioned facts
              which he regarded as good reasons for an increase of this allowance rather than its
              diminution.

            Mr. CARSON insisted that all this service was performed in about two months'
              time, and $81,813 was too large a sum to be paid for it.

            Mr. LASELLE moved ineffectually to amend the amendment so as to reduce the sum to
              $5,000.The amendment reducing the- amount to $10,000 was agreed to upon a
              division-affirmative 24, negative 15.

            The section, as amended, was then adopted.

            Mr. STEIN moved to fill the blank in the section reported by the committee for an
              allowance to John A. Wilstach for services as Commissioner for the encouragement of
              emigration, with $2,500, and submitted reasons why this appropriation should be
              made.

            Mr. FISHER was of opinion that $2,500 was a small sum, and would be perfectly willing
              to allow actual expenses, although it was no legal claim on the State.

            Mr. CARSON opposed making any allowance at all for this unauthorized service.

            Mr. FOSDICK, as chairman of the Committee on Emigration, knew
              nothing about this claim and consequently would vote against it.

            Mr. WOLCOTT recited the history of Mr. Wilstach's appointment, and stated that
              as Commissioner he published pamphlets in the interest of the his own expense.

            

            Mr. CARSON moved to amend by making the appropriation $500.

            Mr. FOSDICK made an ineffectual motion to strike out the section. The amendment [Mr.
              Carson's] was agreed to-upon a division-affirmative 19, negative 10.

            Mr. TURNER felt under obligations to pay this gentleman something, because in the
              session of 1867, it was rather understood among Senators that he should have some
              compensation for representing the State abroad.

            Mr. STEIN referred to the Legislative action of 1867 in reference to this matter.
              Trusting to the faith and honor of the Legislature Mr. W. had performed this service
              to the best of his ability.

            The CHAIRMAN, having examined the rules, found that the largest sum should be put
              first, and thereupon-

            Mr. CARSON withdrew his amendment.

            The amendment to fill the blank with $2,500 was rejected 22 to 19.

            Mr. HADLEY moved to fill the blank with $1,000.

            Mr. WOOD proposed $2,000.

            Mr. SCOTT understood there was no testimony placed before the Committee on
                Emigration showing what this gentleman had done for which he claims an
              appropriation. There being no authority for the action of this agent, he should vote
              against the proposed allowance, which was a mere gift anyhow.

            The two thousand dollar amendment was rejected.

            Mr. TURNER moved, ineffectually, to fill the blank with one thousand five hundred
              dollars.

            The one thousand dollar amendment was also rejected.A section allowing two hundred
              and forty-three dollars for two months' service of an Assistant Surgeon of the
              Forty-first regiment being read-

            Mr. FISHER explained the justness of the claim, and urged that this allowance be
              made.

            Mr. SMITH remembered that this claim last session, on the ground that it was a claim
              against the General Government.

            Mr. SHERROD regarded the claim as just. The State has paid every one of the Surgeons
              that he knew of except this one.

            The section was adopted.

            An amendment to the bill allowing $1,000 each to John U. Pettit and James R. Slack
              for their services as Attorneys in the case of L.P. Milligan et als against the State, now pending, being read -

            Mr. ROBINSON, of Madison, explained the circumstances connection with this claim.

            Mr. TURNER regarded this as another appropriation unauthorized by law.

            The section was rejected upon a division of the committee.

            Mr. KINLEY offered an additional section approriating $5,000 for making repairs at
              the Soldier's Home.

            Mr. FISHER understood that the foundation of the Soldiers home was defective stood on
              blocks-that the fences needed repairs, etc.

            The section was adopted.

            Mr. HOOPER offered an aditional section appropriating for the House of Refuge, ten
              thousand dollars for 1869, and ten thousand dollars for 1871.

            The amendment was rejected.

            Mr. WOLCOTT presented additional amendments, allowing pay for the Sentinel and Journal newspapers furnished during the extra
              session, which were agreed to.

            An amendment-appropriating $10,000 for the years 1869 and 1870 to the State
              University being read-

            Mr. FISHER thought this University has a sufficient sum for its support now amounting
              to about $15,000 annually.

            Mr. GREEN was willing to increase the endowment to fifteen thousand dollars
              yearly.

            Mr. HANNA offered a substitute, which was adopted, appropriating seven thousand
              dollars a year for 1869 and 1870.

            Mr. ANDREWS offered a section, which was adopted, allowing pay to a Clerk of the
              Morgan Raid Commission.

            Mr. CAVIN offered a section, which was adopted, allowing the German Telegraph pay for papers furnished the first five days of the session.

            On motion by Mr. BRADLEY, the committee rose, reported progress and asked to be
              discharged from the further consideration of the bill.

            The report was concurred in. 

          
          

          
            THE MORGAN RAID CLAIMS.

            Mr. TURNER moved to suspend the order of business in order to press to its passage
              the Morgan raid bill [H. R. 119.]

            The motion was agreed to by yeas, 25; nays, 19.

            Mr. JAQUESS moved to amend by striking out the emergency clause, and levying a tax to
              pay said claim.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR decided it out of order-all bills raising revenue must
              originate in the House of Representatives.

            Mr. HANNA demanded the previous question.

            The demand was seconded upon a division-affirmative, 22; negative, 22-the Governor
              voting "aye."

            So the Senate refused to order the bill read the third time by yeas, 16; nays,
              28.

            

            Mr. CARSON made an ineffectual motion to adjourn-yeas, 13; nays, 31.

            Mr. JAQUESS moved that when the Senate adjourn it be till 7 1/2 o'clock
              to-night.

            The motion was rejected by yeas 17, nays 26.

            Mr. HOOPER moved to amend the bill by striking out the emergency clause and providing
              that the claims shall be paid in one, two and three years. He offered this amendment
              in good faith, to protect the people from oppression that would inevitably follow.

            Mr. CRAVENS, to save time, and on be half of the friends of the bill, was willing to
              accept the amendment.

            Mr. CARSON was heard in opposition to the bill. When he had concluded-

            The amendment was agreed to.

            The bill was then ordered to be read the third time by yeas 30, nays 9.

            Mr. CARSON made an ineffectual motion to adjourn.

            The bill [H. R. 119] appropriating four hundred and thirteen thousand five hundred
              and ninety-nine dollars and thirteen cents to pay claims of sufferers by the Morgan
              raid, being read the third time-

            Mr. BELLAMY demanded the previous question. The Senate seconded the same, and under
              its pressure-

            The bill passed the Senate by yeas 26, nays 14-as follows:

            
              
                
                  YEAS-Messrs. Andrews, Bellamy, Caven, Church, Cravens.
                    Denbo, Eliott, Gifford, Green, Hanna, Henderson, Huey, Huffman, Humphreys,
                    Jaquess, Johnson of Spencer, Lee, Montgomery, Morgan, Rice, Robinson of Madison,
                    Scott, Sherrod, Taggart, Turner, Wood-26.

                  NAYS-Messrs. Beardsley, Carson, Case, Fisher, Fosdick, Gray,
                    Hadley, Hamilton, Hess, Hooper, Kinley, Robinson of Decatur, Smith,
                    Wolcott-14.
                
              
            

            Pending the roll-call-

            Mr. JOHNSON of Spencer, in explanation of his vote said: I have some misgivings in
              voting for this bill. I have heretofore been ranked among those voting against it, but
              I believe it will pass at some future day, and preferring its passage at present to
              any subsequent time, I vote "aye."So the bill passed.

            Mr. WOLCOTT offered a concurrent resolution, which was adopted, authorizing the Board
              of Trustees of the State Normal School to confer degrees.

            Mr. KINLEY moved to suspend the rules that the school building bill [H. R. 321] may be put upon its passage now.

            No quorum voting thereon-

            The Senate adjourned. 

          
          
          
          
        
        

        
          HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

           The House met at 9 o'clock A. M.

          Mr. CORY introduced a bill [H. R. 397] declaring what counties shall constite the
            Fourth Judicial Circuit etc. He explained that this is simply a proposition to
            consolidate the Fourth and Twenty-sixth Circuits-no politics in it. He moved to suspend
            the constitutional restrictions, and put the bill on its passage.

          The motion was rejected-yeas 51, nays 37 - two-thirds not voting in the
            affirmative.

          The SPEAKER stated the order of the consideration of the two bills [H. R. 270, 315] for
            which the restriction was suspended yesterday.

          Mr. WELBORN asked leave of absence indefinitely, on account or pressing business.

          Mr. DUNN objected, because we will be called upon this week either to ratify or reject
            the constitutional amendment.

          Mr. W. was excused.

          Mr. VATER entered his motion to reconsider the vote of yesterday rejecting the Keely
            claim of $2,101.

          Mr. McBride entered his motion to reconsider the vote of yesterday indefinitely
            postponing the bill [S. 75]. 

          
            COUNTY ASYLUMS.

            Mr. Zollar's bill [H. R. 315] to authorize County Commissioners to make
              appropriations or donations for county asylums, was taken up under the suspension of
              the restriction taken yesterday, and read the second time.

            The bill was considered as engrossed, ordered to the third reading, and read the
              third time.

            Mr. WILLIAMS, of Knox, and Mr. JOHNSTON, of Parke, explained that the bill authorizes
              the County Commissioners to make appropriations to buy land, erect buildings, &c.,
              to assist in taking care of the incurably insane, that may be sent home from the State
              Institution.

            The bill was finally passed the House of Representatives'yeas 80, nays 6. 

          
          

          
            DITCHING CLAIMS.

            The bill [S. 270] to provide for the payment of ditching certain swamp lands, out of
              the swamp land fund, was taken up under the suspension of the restriction taken
              yesterday.

            After objections and explanations by Mr. WILLIAMS, of Knox, Mr. WILDMAN, and
              others.

            Mr. DAVIS, of Floyd, said, on examination, he found that the bill is all right, and
              he urged the vote.

            The bill failed-yeas 41, nays 45-Mr. COFFROTH explaining-that the whole purpose and
              spirit of the swamp land legislation, both State
              and National, was to reclaim the swamp lands; and where there is a surplus, (as now in
              the general swamp land fund), it should go to pay the ditching claims in those
              counties where there is a deficit. Mr. Davis, of Floyd, and Mr. Lamborn also submitted
              similar explanations, and Mr. Williams, of Knox, read from the law to fortify his
              objections.

            Mr. RUDDELL moved ineffectually to take up his bill [H. R. 395] to enable cities to
              aid in the construction of branch railroads of roads running through, etc.

            Mr. WILLSON moved ineffectually to take up the Court bill [S. 308]. 

          
          

          
            THE 15TH AMENDMENT.

            Mr. UNDERWOOD moved that the House now lake up the special order for the
              consideration of the 15th Constitutional amendment.

            The motion was agreed to; and then-

            Mr. UNDERWOOD moved to make the amendment the special order for Friday at 2
              o'clock P. M.

            Mr. OSBORN moved ineffectually to lay the motion on the table; and then-

            Under pressure of the previous question, Mr. Underwood's motion was agreed
              to.

            Mr. OSBORN entered his motion to reconsider the vote of yesterday, rejecting Mr.
              Stephenson's indexing bill [H. R. 392.] 

          
          

          
            EQUIPMENTS FOR MILITARY ORGANIZATIONS.

            Mr. RUDDELL called up his bill [H. R. 274] to authorize arms and equipments to be
              furnished to organized military companies, which failed yesterday for lack of a
              constitutional majority; and proceeded briefly to explain the necessity and propriety
              of the bill.

            The bill was rejected-yeas 39, nays 44-Mr. COFFROTH explaining his negative
              vote-because of the inutility and expensiveness of the bill. And Mr. DAVIS, of
              Elkhart, reasoning in favor of the bill to utilize the arms of the State now rusting
              in the arsenal. Mr. JOHNSON, of Parke-also speaking for the utility of the bill. Mr.
              NEFF - objecting to the distinction for loyal organizations; Let us have peace. Mr.
              PIERCE, of Vigo - These arms are distributed over the State, and we never hear of them
              again. Mr. RATLIFF - hoping those arms would lay and rust in the arsenal, without use
              or preparation for war. Mr. RUDDELL - reasoning for the bill, that we may secure peace
              by being prepared for war. Grant that a few straps and muskets may be lost - grant the
              plea of expensiveness, it weighs not against his consideration. Mr. SHOAFF - the
              manual of arms may be learned without a musket. Mr. UNDERWOOD - aye, to prepare for
              the imminent war of races. [Laughter.] Mr. WILDMAN - Military companies may be
              sustained in the cities, but not in the country at large. 

          
          

          
            REAL ESTATE CONVEYANCES LEGALIZED.

            Mr. Odell's bill [H. R. 208] to legalize conveyances of real estate made by
              married women under 21 years of age in cases where they have joined with their
              husbands in conveying the land while such husband was living, etc., was read the third
              time, in its order.

            Mr. COFFROTH explained its provisions.

            The bill was finally passed the House-yeas 61, nays 1.

              one of the act of March 5, 1859, to provide for the election of Supervisors, etc., and

            On motion of Mr. COFFROTH, Mr. Ruddell's bill [H. R. 157] to regulate the
              publication of legal advertisements, was taken up in order on the third reading, with
              the amendment of the Judiciary Committee, providing that the advertisement be inserted
              but once a week in the daily paper, etc.

            The amendment was concurred in.

            On motion of Mr. WILLIAMS, of Knox, the clause requiring the publication of the act
              in the Journal and the Sentinel was stricken out
              by unanimous consent.

            The bill, as amended, was then passed the House-yeas 70, nayc 0. 

          
          

          
            PETROLEUM OIL INSPECTION.

            Mr. Greene's bill [H. R. 262] to amend sections 3 and 8 of the act of March 9,
              1863, to provide for the inspection of petroleum oil, etc., was read the third
              time.

            Mr. GREENE said it required a higher test110 degrees of Fahrenheit, and it increases
              the compensation of the inspectors.

            The bill was finally passed the House of Representatives-yeas 51, nays 19. 

          
          

          
            RAILROAD AND BRIDGE AID.

            Mr. Cory's bill [H. R. 238] to authorize County Commissioners to donate money in
              aid of railroads, and to appropriate money from the county treasuries for the purpose
              of building bridges, and legalizing appropriations heretofore made for such purposes,
              was taken up in order and-read the third time.

            The bill was rejected-yeas 32, nays 44. 

          
          

          
            SHOW LICENSE LAW OF 1852.

              merchandize, to exhibit caravans, circuses, rope and wire dancing, legerdemain, etc.,
              was taken up in order, and read the third time.

            Mr. UNDERWOOD explained that it would save license money to the agricultural
              societies, etc.

            The bill was finally passed the House yeas 62, nays 12. 

          
          

          
            SWAMP LAND COMMISSIONERS.

            Mr. Williams', of Knox, bill [H. R. 282] to amend section 28 of the act of May
              29, 1852, to regulate the sale of swamp lands granted by the United States to the

              of said grant, was taken up in order, and read the third time.

            Mr. WILLIAMS said the bill proposes to allow the Commissioners $3 00 and the
              Engineers $3 50 a day.

            The bill was finally passed the House-yeas 72, nays 3. 

          
          

          
            SHIPPING-MISDEMEANOR.

            Mr. Coffroth's bill [H. R. 231], prescribing a certain misdemeanor, and
              punishment therefor [$50 to $1,000 penalty for issuing a bill of lading without the
              article shipped], was taken up in order, and read the third time.

            The bill was finally passed the House-yeas 75, nays 1.

            Mr. LONG moved for indefinite leave of absence for Mr. Davis, of Floyd-Mr. Davis
              adding his request in person. But objection being urged, the motion was withdrawn.

            Mr. OSBORN moved for a suspension of the order of business, to enable him to submit
              the following, which was read for information:

            Resolved, That for the purpose of passing important bills, the roll
              shall be called, and each member when his name is called, shall have the right to have
              any Senate bill, or any House bill on the third reading, to be acted on by the House,
              and the rules shall be dispensed with for the purpose, and further proceedings, under
              the present suspension shall be suspended.

            After debate by Mr. Osborn and Mr. Pierce of Vigo-the latter urging its adoption,
              because the indications are, that after to-morrow, we shall not be able to do any more
              business.

            On motion of Mr. BRITTON it was laid on the table-57 in the affirmative on a
              division. 

          
          

          
            SCHOOL HOUSES.

             Mr. Tebbs' bill [H. R. 380] to amend section 27 of the Common School Law, was
              taken up in order on the third reading.

            Mr. TEBBS explained that it is to admit of public grounds to be devoted to school
              purposes.

            It was finally passed the House-yeas 72, nays 2.

            On motion of Mr. PIERCE of Porter Divorce bills were made the special order for
              to-morrow at 10 o'clock. 

            Mr. Hamilton's bill [H. R. 166] requiring the publication of legal
              advertisements and notices to be made in German newspaper in certain cases
              [advertisements relation to the public business when there is a German paper published
              in the county was taken up in order and read the third time.

            It was finally passed the House of Representatives-yeas 69, nays 4.

            Mr. UNDERWOOD desired to submit the following:

            Resolved, That the special committee to which was referred the
              Senate bridge bill No. 120 be requested to report the same to-morrow morning at 9
              o'clock A. M., and that the same be made the special order for
              that hour.

            Objection being made, it was not entertained.

            Mr. Breckinridge's wild bird protection bill [H. R. 229] was taken up in order,
              and read the third time.

            Mr. FURNAS and Mr. BEELER spoke for the passage of the bill as important to the fruit
              and farming interests, and for protection against the destruction of these birds, not
              by sportsmen, but by scallawag boys.

            The bill failed on this vote-yeas 47, nays 25 several members explaining that they
              vote against it because it is too sweeping in its provisions for protection.

            The House then took a recess till 2 o'clock. 

          
          

          
            AFTERNOON SESSION.

             The SPEAKER resumed the Chair at 2 o'clock. 


          
            THE MEDICAL PROFESSION BILL.

            Mr. McBride's motion to reconsider the vote of yesterday for the indefinite
              postponement- of the Medical Profession bill [S. 75] was agreed to, and the bill was
              referred to a special committee, viz: Messrs. McBride, Chittenden, Jump, and
              others.

            Mr. WILLIAMS, of Hamilton, desired to submit an order for night sessions.

            Mr. WILLIAMS, of Union, desired to offer an order to print the journals in the German
              language; which propositions were objected to. 

          
          

          
            THE CALENDAR.

             The SPEAKER announced the order of the consideration of bills of the House on their
              third reading. 

          
          

          
            RAILROAD BONDS, ETC.

            Mr. Welborn's bill [H. R. 246], to authorize railroad companies to issue bonds,
              and cities and towns to purchase them, etc., taken up in order and read the third
              time.

            The bill was rejected on this vote-yeas 27, nays 42. 

          
          

          

          
            INFORMATION BILL.

            Mr. WILLIAMS of Hamilton's bill [H. R 281], to apprehend and convict persons
              used of crimes and misdemeaners, was taken up in order and read the third time.

            Mr. STEPHENSON said such information subpoenas were now sometimes issued by Justices.
              This was to give them such power and settle the construction of the statue.

            Mr. PIERCE, of Vigo, and Mr. NEFF submitted opposing considerations to giving such
              inquisitorial power. 

            Mr. BUSKIRK (Mr. Monroe in the Chair,) also opposed the bill. Such powers heretofore
              assumed by justices in his county worked badly. He gave examples. The file existing
              provisions of law for prosecuting for crime were ample, through the Grand Juries,
              etc.

            Mr. STEPHENSON replied, defending the provisions of the bill. In reply to Mr.
              Neff's question, whether it is not competent for any person to go before a
              judicial officer, and cause the apprehension of suspected persons by oath, he replied
              in the affirmative, but proceeded to show that that provision is not sufficient, and
              he gave examples.

            The bill was rejected-yeas 18, nays 65.

            Mr. Zollars' bill [H. R. 84] to legalize the proceedings of the Common Councils
              of cities in opening streets and alleys, coming up- 

            On motion of Mr. NBFF, it was indefinitely postponed. 

          
          

          
            ROAD TOLLS INCREASE.

            Mr, Greene's bill [H. R. 148] providing for the taxation of costs in certain
              cases, coming up-

            Mr. PIERCE, of Porter, explained: that the losing party in appeals in road cases,
              shall pay the costs, and in no such cases shall the county pay the costs.

            The bill was rejected on this vote yeas 39, nays 44.Mr. Dittemore's bill [H. R.
              232] allowing an increased rate of toll on turnpike, plank and gravel roads in certain
              cases, was taken up in order.

            Mr. STEPHENSON explained, that as he is informed, it is a proposition to allow roads
              constructed under a special charter increase their toll so that they shall be equal to
              those charged by roads built under the General Road law. But the reading of the bill
              showed that it applies to all roads.

            Mr. COFFROTH was satisfied with the bill, and desired its passage.

            The bill was finally passed the House - yeas 60, nays 25. 

          
          

          
            HORSE DISTEMPER BILL.

            Mr. Johnson, of Montgomery's, bill [H. R. 199] to prevent the spread of
              distemper among horses, was taken up in order, and read the third time.

            It proposes a penalty for allowing such horses to run at large, not exceeding fifty
              dollars.

            The bill was finally passed the House yeas 62, nays 16-with an amendment of title,
              "and prescribing penalties therefor." 

             On motion of Mr. STANTON, proceedings in this order were suspended, and the House
              took up the consideration of the specific bill [H. R. 396] a supplementary bill for
              this session, with the amendments reported from the Committee on Ways and
                Means, adding sundry sections, and the bill was read the second time by
              sections.

            The committee's amendments were concurred in.

            Mr. STEWART, of Rush, proposed twenty-five dollars each, for the extra allowance to
              the members of the Prison Committee.

            Mr. DITTEMORE proposed to amend the item of allowance to the members of the
                Prison Committee by striking out ten dollars each, and inserting
              "five cents a mile" in lieu.

            Mr. COFFROTH and Mr. MONROE suggested that some of the members of the Committee might
              come in pretty heavily for mileage.

            Mr. DITTEMORE then withdrew his amendment to the amendment; and the original
              amendment was concurred in.

            Mr. McDONALD submitted the following:

            SEC.That each member of the House be allowed $15, to correspond
              with the amount drawn by each member of the Senate for stationery and stamps during
              the special session. [Laughter.]

            The SPEAKER supposed that would be taken by consent.

            Mr. WILDMAN proposed to add the allowance of three hundred and seventy-four dollars
              and sixty-seven cents to D. M. Bryden; which was not entertained, because it was
              heretofore rejected by the House.

            Mr. VATER proposed to add a section for allowance of two thousand one hundred and
              ninety-nine dollars of the claim of Daniel Keely and sons, for services as musicians
              in the State service.

            After debate in which Messrs. VATER, WILDMAN, JOHNSTON of Parke, STANTON and others
              took part-

            Mr. COFFROTH moved ineffectually to lay the amendment on the table-yeas 21, nays
              61.

            Mr. COFFROTH delivered his protest against the allowance of such old State claims as
              this.

            Mr. RUDDELL replied and defended the claim-as he thought he might well do before
              gentlemen who voted for the allowance of four hundred and thirteen thousand dollars to
              the Morgan raid claimants. 

            

            Mr. STANTON also defended the claim, and replied to objections. When he had
              concluded-

            Mr. WILLSON demanded the previous question, and, under its operation, the amendment
              was adopted-yeas 53, nays 30.

            Mr. BAKER, explaining, that it commanded his vote, because it is alleged to be just,
              and not paid.

            Mr. CARNAHAN voted "no," because it seemed to him that whoever employed
              this Keely and his sons should have provided for his pay.

            Mr. DAVIS, of Floyd, explained his affirmative vote, because the claimants were as
              loyal as those who would laugh at them here, on the same principle that he plead and
              voted for the payments to the Morgan raid sufferers.

            Mr. MONROE voted for the amendment, because the claim for the service was made clear
              on evidence.

            Mr. OSBORN voted "no," believing that this man Keely was paid in camp as a
              leader and teacher of bands.

            Mr. WILDMAN moved to amend by adding an item for allowance of the claim of D. M.
              Bryden for three hundred and seventy-four dollars, for repairs on the gunboat
              Chillicothe on the Ohio river-reducing the amount a fraction.

            It was rejected.

            Mr. RUDDELL proposed to add a section for allowance of three dollars and seventy-five
              cents for a special order on the Spencer House, which was agreed to.

            Mr. FURNAS proposed a section for twenty thousand dollars, or so much thereof as may
              be necessary for the purchase and removal to Indianapolis of the Mineralogical Cabinet
              of the late Dr. D. D. Owen, etc.

            The amendment was adopted.

            Mr. JOHNSON of Marshall, proposed a section to allow Samuel Beatty the sum of one
              hundred and ten dollars for costs paid by him in the Beatty-Peelle contest, by which
              Mr. Beatty obtained the place of Representative for the counties of Laporte and Starke
              in this House.

            After debate-the amendment was adopted-yeas 40, nays 27.

            Mr. WILDMAN now presented the item for the allowance of three hundred and
              seventy-four dollars to D. M. Bryden, for the use of D. and G. Howard.

            After explanation by Mr. McBRIDE-the amendment was adopted.

            Mr. COFFROTH proposed to amend, by adding a resolution to allow James R. Peelle one
              hundred dollars-his cost and expenses in the Beatty-Peelle contest.

            Mr. McDONALD, (to vary the amount heretofore rejected by the House) moved to make it
              ninety-nine dollars, which was accepted by Mr. Coffroth.

            Mr. WILLSON moved ineffectually to lay the amendment on the table-yeas 13 nays
              61.

            After debate by Mr. WILLSON and M. BATES, under the pressure of the previous
              question, the amendment was adopted- yeas 52, nays 16.

            Mr. RATLIFF proposed to add an item for allowance of forty-nine dollars to Samuel
              Beatty, for attorneys' fees paid by him in the Beatty-Peelle contest.

            The amendment was rejected-yeas 35 nays 35. 

            Mr. LONG proposed to add an item for the allowance of four hundred dollars to John
              Baker, of Brown county, Indiana, bounty money paid into the State Treasury for his
              benefit, which he has not been able to draw. The amendment was agreed to.

            Mr. WILLSON entered his motion to reconsider the vote adopting the item for the
              allowance of Mr. Peelle's contest expenses.

            Mr. VATER proposed to amend by adding an allowance of five dollars to the proprietor
              of the Evening Commercial for five days of this session, before it
              was decided to take or reject his paper, which was adopted.

            Mr. DUNN moved to reconsider the vote by which Mr. McDonald's item for the
              allowance of fifteen dollars to each member for stamps and stationery was adopted;
              pending which-

            The House adjourned. 

          
          
            
          
        
        

        
          IN SENATE.
          
            WEDNESDAY, May 12, 1869.
          

          The Senate met at 9 o'clock A. M.

          Mr. Bradley and Mr. Reynolds had leave to record their votes in the affirmative, and
            Mr. Stein in the negative on the Morgan raid claim bill [H. R. 119], passed last
            evening.

          Mr. STEIN, asking leave to record his vote on House bill 119, said: I do not wish to be
            deemed as shirking the responsibility of a vote at any time, and desire to say that my
            absence yesterday, when the vote on the Morgan Raid bill was called, was accidental. I
            ask that my vote may now be recorded in the negative, as it would have been rendered had
            I been here, may add that I was originally dispose to favor the bill on the belief that
            the United States had, in the case of Ohio, set a precedent for the repayment to the
            State such claims. The disclosures made in the course of debate, a few days ago, since
            the bill came from the House, corrected this impression, and left me no hope that such
            repayment would ever be made. From that time I concluded to oppose this bill.

          Subsequently, Mr. ARMSTRONG obtained leave to
            record his vote in the negative also.

          On motion by Mr. JAQUESS, the reading of the Secretary's minutes of yesterday was
            dispensed with.

          Mr. WOOD, by leave, introduced a bill [S. 355] to fix the time of terms of the Circuit
            Courts in the Eighth Judicial Circuit, which was read three times, under a dispensation
            of the constitutional restriction, and passed the Senate by yeas 41, nays 0.

          Mr. KINLEY moved, ineffectually, for a dispensation that the bill [H. R. 321] to authorize cities, towns and townships
            to bar school houses, may be pressed to its passage.

          On his motion, it was read the second time.

          M. RICE offered a resolution, which was adopted, that the Senate proceed to the
            election of a President pro tempore, to
            preside during the absence of the Lieutenant Governor.

          Mr. RICE nominated Mr. Gray.

          Mr. STEIN nominated Mr. Cravens.

          Mr. CRAVENS declined-understanding that this election was intended to hold over until
            the next session, and his term expired before the ensuing regular session.

          There being no further nominations, the rote was taken, and Mr. Gray was declared
            elected. 

          
            EDUCATION OF COLORED CHILDREN.

            Mr. SCOTT moved to take up the Colored Children Educational bill [H. R. 113.]

            Mr. CARSON moved to amend by inserting the Specific Appropriation bill [H. R. 311.] 

            Mr. STEIN moved to substitute the Constitutional Amendment.

            Mr. BELLAMY moved to lay the amendments on the table.

            Mr. WOLCOTT demanded a division of the question.

            The substitute [Mr. Stein's] was laid on foe table by yeas 32, nays 10.

            The amendment [Mr. Craven's] was also laid on the table.

            The motion to take up the bill [H. R. 113] to
              render taxation for common school Purposes uniform and provide for the education of
              colored children of the State, was agreed to.

            Mr. HADLEY demanded the previous question.

            The Senate seconded the demand.

            Under the pressure of the previous question the bill was read the third time and
              passed by yeas 33, nays 9. 

          
          

          
            THE SPECIFIC APPROPRIATION BILL.

            On motion by Mr. WOLCOTT the Senate proceeded to the consideration of the specific
              appropriation bill [H. R. 311.]

            The action of the Committee of the Whole Senate in striking from
              the report of the Committee on Finance a section appropriating
              certain sums of money, varying in amount from $238 down to less than $20, to some
              twenty different persons on account of expenses incurred by them in defending suits
              instituted against them for arrests made while acting under military orders, was
              sustained by yeas 23, nays 18several Senators explaining their negative votes by
              declaring there was not a shadow of legal authority for the acts of these men.

            Mr. HOOPER moved to amend by adding an appropriation of $10,000 for the years 1870
              and 1871 for the House of Refuge.

            The motion was agreed to by yeas 28, nays 11.

            Mr. BELLAMY moved to strike from the amendments submitted by the Finance
                Committee the appropriation of $7,501 34 for articles used by the State in
              the construction of the Northern Prison.

            Mr. FISHER, knowing more about this claim than any other member of this Legislature,
              declared it to be unjust and without any good foundation. He recited the facts
              connected with it from 1861 to the present time.

            Mr. BRADLEY insisted that the claim is for property appropriated by the State, which
              has never yet been paid for, as shown before a committee of this Senate.

            Mr. HOOPER, a member of the same committee with Mr. Bradley, said there is not due
              from the State one dollar of this claim. It is an outrage on the people of the State
              for the claimants to require the State to pay for this property over again.

            The motion to strike out was rejected, by yeas 17, nays 24.

            Mr. STEIN offered an amendment appropriating $2,500 to John A. Wilstach for services
              as Commissioner of Emigration.

            Mr. CARSON demanded the previous question, and there being a second, the amendment
              was rejected by yeas 9, nays 32.

            Mr. ROBINSON, of Madison, offered an amendment allowing $1,000 each to James R. Slack
              and John U. Pettit, for services as attorneys in the case of the State vs. L. P.
              Milligan et alias.

            The amendment was agreed to.

            Mr. RICE offered an amendment allowing one thousand dollars to John A. Wilstach for
              services as Commissioner of Emigration.

            Mr. HANNA moved, ineffectually, to lay the amendment on the table.

            The amendment was then agreed to by yeas 23, nays 19.

            Mr. WOLCOTT made an ineffectual demand for the previous question.

            Mr. BELLAMY offered an amendment, which was agreed to, allowing $25 to the  Evening Commercial for papers
              furnished at the beginning of this session.

            Mr. CAVIN offered an amendment, which was agreed to, allowing $100 to Win. Sheets for
              ten months rent of three rooms by Col Carrington.

            Mr. RICE moved to reconsider the vote just taken.

            The motion was agreed to by yeas 27, nays 16.

            And then came the recess for dinner. 

          
          

          
            AFTERNOON SESSION.

            The pending amendment allowing $100 to Wm. Sheets for room rent, was agreed to by
              yeas 21, nays 20.

            On motion by Mr. WOLCOTT, whose demand for the previous question was seconded by the
              Senate, the Senate amendments to the Specific Appropriation bill [H. R. 311] were considered as engrossed, and the
              bill was read the third time.

            The bill then finally passed the Senate by yeas 30, nays 14-with amendment of title,
              viz: "A bill making specific appropriations for years 1869 and 1870."

            On motion by Mr. KINLEY, the bill [H. R. 288] to amend sections 4 and 8 of the Liquor
              law of March 5, 1859, was read the first time.

            He made an ineffectual motion-yeas 31, nays 14-to suspend the constitutional
              restriction that the bill may be pressed to its passage.

            On motion of Mr. GRAY the bill [H. R. 52]
              authorizing the assessment of lands for plank, gravel and McAdamized road purposes,
              and repealing the law of March 11, 1867, was read the third time.

            Mr. CARSON asked, but failed to obtain, unanimous consent to amend the bill, so that
              farmers living on the road may travel thereon half a mile in either direction from
              their residences without payment of toll.

            Mr. LASALLE moved in vain for unanimous consent to insert a provision allowing
              material to be taken "within one and one-half mile of said road."

            Mr. CARSON, confident that this bill could not be worse than the present law which it
              repeals, would vote for it.

            Mr. FOSDICK favored it for the same reason-it repealed a very objectionable law.

            The bill passed by yeas 36, nays 6.

            Mr. Stein, for Mr. Lee, obtained a suspension of the constitutional restriction and
              he introduced a bill [S. 356] fixing the times of holding the Circuit Courts in the
              county of Bartholomew, which was pressed to the final reading, and passed by yeas 42,
              nays 0.

            On motion by Mr. CHURCH, the bill [H. R. 284] for the relief of the heirs of Patrick
              Donoven, deceased, was read the second time.

            On his further motion, the constitutional restriction was dispensed with, the bill
              read the third time, and finally passed by yeas 42, nays 0.

            On motion by Mr. JAQUESS the bill, [ H. R.
              95,] for the relief of John Ingle and John Ingle Jr., was read by title.

            On motion by Mr. JAQUESS the constitutional restriction was dispensed with and the
              bill read by sections the third time.

            Mr. HANNA understood the 200 acres of valuable land covered by the provisions of this
              bill had escheated to the State by the alienage of heirs, and asked for information as
              to whether the Ingle's had eve purchased the tract. 

            Mr. JAQUESS said it was a House bill and he supposed the committee of that body had
              examined it carefully.

            The bill passed by yeas 31, nays 9,Mr. GIFFORD, by leave, introduced a bill, [S.
              357,] to fix the times of holding the Circuit Courts in the 26th Judicial Circuit
              which was read the first time.

            On his further motion, under a dispensation of the constitutional restriction, the
              bill was read by title, again by sections, and passed the Senate by yeas 41, nays
              0.

            On motion by Mr. GREEN the bill, [ H. R. 160,]
              to legalize the official acts of the several Trustees of Noblesville, was taken up;
              and under a dispensation read and passed the Senate by yeas 38, nays 6.

            On motion of Mr. HENDERSON, the bill [H. R. 325] to provide for the relocation of
              county seats, the erection of public buildings, and repealing all inconsistent laws,
              was read the first time.

            On his further motion, under a suspension of the constitutional rule, the bill was
              read by title and referred to a select committee of three Senators, which the
              Lieutenant Governor made to consist of Messrs. Henderson, Hanna and Hadley.

            Mr. ROBINSON, of Madison, called up the bill [H. R.
                321] amending the act authorizing cities and towns to issue bonds to build or
              complete unfinished school buildings, approved March, 1867.

            Mr. CARSON thought the bill would authorize irresponsible Township Trustees to create
              large liabilities, and encourage bad men to combine and thereby make the public
              interests to suffer.

            Mr. FOSDICK explained that this law proposes simply that the officers referred to may
              buy school house, as well as build them-it only amends the law in this particular.

            Mr. KINLEY said the bill would proves great saving of money; for buildings can be
              bought much cheaper than they can be erected.

            Mr. GRAY made an ineffectual motion to refer the bill to the Judiciary
                Committee.


            

            Mr. ROBINSON, of Madison, moved to end the rules that the bill may be read the third
              time now.

            The motion was agreed to, and the bill was read the third time.

            Mr. CARSON protested against such hasty action on so important a bill. He regretted
              the motion to refer it to an appropriate committee had been so summarily voted
              down.

            Mr. FOSDICK again explained the only change from the present law proposed by this
              bill is that school buildings may be bought-the act of March, 1867, which he read,
              allowing them to be erected or completed with funds raised by the sale of bonds.

            The bill passed by yeas 39, nays 4. 

            The bill H. R. 136 was read by title and referred to a special committee of three, on
              motion by Mr. DENBO.

            Mr. FISHER, from the Committee on Finance, returned the House
              concurrent resolution for the purchase of the mineralogical cabinet of Dr. D. D. Owen,
              recommending its passage.

            Mr. Carson asked but failed to obtain unanimous consent to offer the following:

            WHEREAS, House bill No. 170 was, several days ago, at the instance
              and request of members of the Judiciary Committee, referred to said
              Committee.

            AND WHEREAS, Said Committee was instructed to
              report said bill back to the senate with or without amendment by Tuesday last at 10
              o'clock A. M., and said Committee having failed to report said
              bill as instructed ; therefore,

            Resolved, That said Committee be, and they are hereby instructed to
              report said bill back to the Senate forthwith.

            On motion of Mr. ROBINSON, of Decatur, the bill [H.
                R. 158] preventing the evasion of taxation by purchase of United States bonds
              a few days previous to the 1st day of January in each year, was read the second time
              and passed to the third reading.

            Mr. RICE moved to reconsider the vote passing the assessment-for-gravel-road-purposes
              bill [H. R. 52] because its repealing clause
              would probably work great hard-snips in his county.

            Mr. GREEN said no road could organize under this bill-it is only a kind of
              supplementary act to the road laws.

            On motion by Mr. CARSON the motion w reconsider was laid on the table.

            On motion by Mr. HUFFMAN the bill [H. R. 380] to amend section 27 of the Common
              School law of March 6, 1865, was read.

            On his further motion the constitutional rule was set aside, and the bill was read
              the second time by title.

            Mr. HANNA moved to amend by providing that no condemnation of a site shall be made
              nearer than forty rods of a residence. 

            Mr. ROBINSON, of Decatur, moved to add "without the owner's
              consent.'Mr. HANNA accepted the amendment.

            The amendment was agreed to.

            The bill was then read the third time, and pased by yeas 30, nays 8.

            On motion by Mr. HADLEY, the bill [H. R. 167] defining certain misdemeanors, &c.,
              was read the second time. 
          
          
            F. M. MEREDITH.

            Mr. GIFFORD moved to take up the House concurrent resolution removing Director F. M.
              Meredith, of the Southern Prison, that it may be made the special order for 10
              o'clock to-morrow.

            The motion was agreed to by yeas 32, nays 0.

            Mr. HOOPER moved to amend by making this resolution the special order for Friday, at
              10 o'clock A. M.

            Mr. SCOTT thought it an unnecessary waste of time to attempt a trial in the nature of
              impeachment at this late day in the session, and especially since a bill has passed
              this body removing all these officers.

            Mr. KINLEY said it was likely the bill which passed this body was sleeping in the
              hands of a House committee, and if so it was not probable that it would pass. Then the
              House passed this resolution by an almost unanimous vote, which fact alone should
              entitle it to the early consideration of the Senate.

            Mr. HANNA said it was due to the coordinate branch of this General Assembly to act
              upon this resolution-it having passed that body with such unanimity.

            Mr. HOOPER insisted there were other questions of more importance than this; and this
              consideration moved him to offer his amendment.

            Mr. RICE had no disposition to screen any Director, but wanted this man to have a
              fair trial. And as Mr. Meredith desires to be heard by counsel-Messrs. Thompson &
              Baird-he favored the motion to amend.

            Mr. KINLEY was understood to say that this matter has been delayed from day to day in
              order to give Mr. Meredith and his friends time to prepare a defense.

            Mr. GIFFORD was of opinion that the friends of Mr. Meredith were anxious to put this
              off till too late for action-Friday will be too late.

            Mr. STEIN declared that the effect of the adoption of this motion would be to exclude
              all further legislation-it would take up the entire day to-morrow and longer. He hoped
              those of his political faith would see the strategy and vote the motion down.

            Mr. CHURCH said we should consider well what we are doing. It is well known if we
              spend to-morrow upon that question  we do no more
              legislation this session. That is the end of it. Senators may talk about the 15th
              amendment as much as they please; Friday is the day we expect to take that up. We have
              waited all the time our constituents will hear to. We can't let it go any
              further.

            SEVERAL SENATORS-"Nor we
              won't."

            Mr. CHURCH. We have a duty to perform as well as the Democrats. They know how to get
              away from it, and we expect them to. Are we prepared to say that legislation shall
              stop here? I say that man ought to have a trial, but shall he have it at the expense
              of all the business on our desks? Shall we sacrifice all of this to his rights? I do
              not think we ought to stop and attend to his business, and let the State suffer. Every
              lawyer knows it will take all day at least, or else the trial will be a mockery. And I
              want to attend to the business on Friday that is fixed for that day.

            Mr. GIFFORD. If you can not do business without a quorum, you can not do that on
              Friday, for I am going home.

            Mr. CHURCH. Goodbye. The Senator is a good looking man, and he can go tonight if he
              wants to; but let us do our duty and not sacrifice the business that is expected of us
              to-morrow. The minority has every reason to expect that this Fifteenth Amendment will
              come up on Friday, and we have to expect that on Thursday night they will take French
              leave.

            The only wrong done in passing over this matter is to Mr. Meredith and his friends.
              The indications are that it will require a good deal of investigation. I understand
              that he was arraigned in his absence a kind of a Grand Jury trial, and I do not intend
              to take the verdict of the House of Representatives if that is the kind of trial he
              has had. As far as we are concerned, I prefer that he should have ft fair and
              impartial trial.

            And then the Senate adjourned. 

          
          
          
          
        
        

        
          HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.

          The House met at 9 o'clock A. M., and on motion of Mr. VATER,
            the reading of the journal of yesterday was dispensed with.

          Mr. VATER moved, ineffectually, to take up the unfinished order of yesterday, the
            consideration of the supplementary Specific bill. 

          
            THE MORGAN RAID APPROPRIATION BILL.

            Mr. DAVIS, of Floyd, moved to take up the consideration of the Senate amendments
              (just reported by message,) to the Morgan Raid Appropriation bill [H. R. 119], which
              motion was agreed to. 

            Mr. DAVIS then moved that the Senate amendments be concurred in by the House.

            Mr. COTTON moved, ineffectually, to lay the motion on the table-yeas 42, nays 47-Mr.
              DUNN explaining his affirmative vote, stating expressly that he is in favor of the
              allowance of these Morgan raid claims.

            Mr. DAVIS, of Floyd, now demanded the previous question on the adoption of his
              motion, but the House refused to second the demand-affirmative 40, negative 45.
              Whereupon Mr. DAVIS demanded a recount, which resulted-affirmative 42 negative 47. So
              there was not a second.

            Mr. DUNN moved that this bill be made the special order for Friday at 2 o'clock.
              He had from the beginning been in favor of paying these claims, but he was opposed to
              hurrying the bill. He moved to postpone, because there were members here interested,
              and because he would increase the weight of the responsibility of members proposing to
              resign on account of the pendency of another measure. He himself himself would vote
              for the bill; and it had been repeatedly endorsed by this Republican Legislature.

            Mr. WILLSON deprecated the pretense of friendship to this bill which would admit of a
              motion to postpone it to an hour beyond which Democrats were pledged not to remain
              here. The success of the motion would defeat the bill, and he called upon its friends
              to vote it down.

            Mr. COFFROTH voted for this bill indifferently-not being interested, beyond the
              promptings of the feeling of its intrinsic justice. As to whether Democrats would stay
              here and give a quorum next Friday to pass the Fifteenth Amendment, he said not only
              would no Democratic member stay here, but no Democratic dog would stay to give that
              quorum, for forty Morgan raid bills. He said also, (not by way of threat), that such a
              course as this motion proposes, notwithstanding the Morgan raid or other appropriation
              bills, might reduce the House below a quorum before the close of this day.

            Mr. WILDMAN considered this bill as having been put into better shape by the Senate
              amendments, but, as a friend of the bill, he hoped these amendments would not be
              passed under the pressure of the previous question. 

            Mr. OVERMYER proposed to amend Mr. Dunn's motion so as to make the postponement
              of the consideration of these Senate amendments to this afternoon &
              o'clock.

            Mr. STEWART, of Ohio, said the motion of Mr. Dunn was a tack to get rid of the bill,
              to which Mr. Dunn interposed an  indignant
              denial. Still, to postpone the bill was a dodge to defeat it. Such, at least, would be
              the effect of the success of he motion. Let us come out, then, at once, and either pay
              these claimants, or shut out all their hopes from this quarter.

            Mr. RUDDELL. The imputation of dodging could be applied with more propriety to those
              who are dodging the Fifteenth Amendment. He would not remove the burden of
              responsibility from these dodging members. He moved to amend Mr. Dunn's motion so
              as to postpone the bill till Friday, 3 o'clock.

            Mr. DUNN accepted the modification. 

            Mr. RUDDELL then demanded the previous question, and there was a second, and the main
              question was ordered yeas 48, nays 42 Mr. Pierce, of Porter, explaining his negative
              vote the passage of this bill was not more desirable to any man's constituents
              than was the ratification of the Constitutional Amendment to his. Mr. Pierce, of Vigo,
              voted aye, for consistency in his support of this measure, because to postpone it till
              Friday would be as good a defeat, as to postpone till the first of July. Mr. Miles
              voted aye, with the distinct understanding that he should vote against the bill.

            Mr. Overmyer's motion to make the bill the special order for two o'clock,
              was then adopted.

            On motion of Mr. FULLER, the Senate amendments to his Sheriff's Mileage bill [H.
              R. 51] were taken up and concurred in.

            Mr. WILDMAN (by consent) from the Committee on Elections, returned
              and recommended the passage of the bill [S. 166].

            Mr. CHITTENDEN, from the Committee on Corporations, returned the
              bill [S. 323] to amend the charter of the University of Notre Dame Du Lac, at South
              Bend, recommending its passage.

            Mr. SABIN, returned the claim of Nicholas Russell, recommending that at it be not
              allowed. The report was concurred in.

            He also returned the claims of certain parties for illegal confinement in the State
              prison South, without recommendation; Which was laid on the table. 

            Mr. OVERMEYER, from the Committee on the organization of Courts, returned the bill,
              [S. 347,] for Criminal Courts for the counties of LaPorte and St. Joseph, recommending
              its passage. 

          
          

          
            GOVERNORS RESIDENCE BILL.

            Mr. COFFROTH called up his motion to lay his motion to reconsider the vote on the
              final passage of the Governor's residence bill, [S. 230] on the table.

            Mr. JOHNSON, of Parke, demanded a call of the House, which determined 82 members
              present.

            Mr. STEWART, of Rush, demanded the yeas and nays on Mr. Coffroth's motion, and
              the vote resulted-yeas 38, nays 45. So tho motion to reconsider was not laid on the
              table, and the question recurred on the adoption of the motion to reconsider.

            Mr. COFFROTH asked, but (objection being made,) did not obtain leave to withdraw the
              motion to reconsider.

            The motion to reconsider was then agreed to-yeas 48, nays 38, as follows.

            Mr. DAVIS, of Floyd, explaning-that as this is not a political question, and as the
              State may some time have a Democratic Governor, he desired that the Executive should
              have a respectable compensation.

            So the vote on the final passage of said, bill [S. 230] was reconsidered. 

          
          

          
            THE DIVORCE LAW.

            On motion of Mr. PIERCE, of Porter, the House now took up the special order, viz: the
              consideration of Mr. Welborn's Divorce bill [H. R. 378], and the divorce-bills
              [S. 316] and [S. 317].

            Mr. PIERCE, of Porter, submitted a substitute for the bill [S. 316] entitled a bill
              to regulate the service of summons in divorce case proceedings, for issuing judgments
              in certain cases, declaring who shall be considered residents and the manner of
              determining the same-repealing all laws, conflicting herewith, and declaring an
              emergency.

            It provides that defendant shall be served by having the summons read, excepting
              where two witnesses make affidavit that the pafty is endeavoring to elude service,
              or-their whereabouts are unknown; that where divorce has been declared without legal
              notice, the case may be opened again so far as division of property and allimony are
              concerned; and that residence shall be held to mean only such persons as enter the
              State with the intention to take up their abode permanently; and when this is not
              proven, the case shall be dismissed-if  the
              party, come into the State simply for the purpose of obtaining a divorce.

            He took the floor in a general speech setting forth and supporting the provisions of
              his substitute upon the general principles advanced. He had aimed to make his bill
              such as to meet the objections to the other bills; and he recited its provisions.

            Mr. NEFF submitted that, since we have important business before the House, there was
              not time to consider maturely such grave questions as these proposed amendments to the
              divorce Jaw. If the divorce laws, were but rigidly administered, he regarded it as
              good as any we could get. He moved to indefinitely postpone the whole subject.

            Mr. OSBORN said if there was time, he would be in favor of considering the substitute
              of the gentleman from Porter; but since time presses, the best thing, and the only
              thing that could be done, would be to take up arid pass the Senate bill. He recited
              its provision for the service of process, and that in relation to residence, etc., s
              distinct improvements on the existing law. He moved to lay Mr. Neffs motion on the
              table.

            Mr. FIELD of Lagrange, was in favor of passing the Senate bill. His people were
              deeply interested in this question. He opposed the substitute simply because of the
              want of time.

            Mr. DAVIS of Floyd, considered that the divorce law was good enough'as it is-it
              wanted but wise administration and enforcement.

            Mr. COTTON preferred the consideration and passage of the Senate bill-he gave an
              example going to show the necessity of amendment of the divorce law.

            Mr. OSBORN'S motion was agreed to; and then, on his further motion Mr.
              Pierce's substitute was laid on the table.

            The question recurring on ordering the bill to the third reading-

            Mr. ODELL proposed to amend by adding a provision to save pending suits from the
              effects of this act.

            Mr. PIERCE of; Porter, moved to lay the amendment on the table; which motion was
              agreed to-yeas, 46, nays, 34.

            The amendment to the bill reported from the Judiciary Committee,
              viz: strike out the two , last lines of the first section and insert these words:
              "residents of the State," being read-

            Mr. STEPHENSON moved ineffectually to lay it on the table.

            And the committee's amendment was adopted.

            Mr. ODELL moved ineffectually to strike out the emergency clause.

            Mr. CHITTENDEN moved ineffectually to suspend the restriction and put the bill on its
              passage: and the amendments to tin bill [S. 316] were then ordered to be
              engrossed.

            The divorce bill [S. 317] was taken up and indefinitely postponed.

            Mr. Welborn's divorce bill [H. R. 378] was taken up and read.

            On motion of Mr. STANTON, it was laid on the table. 

          
          

          
            BRANCH TURNPIKE ROADS.

            On motion of Mr. STANTON, the bill [S. 146] to
              amend section 8 of the road law of March 6, 1865, so as to admit of the construction
              of short branch roads by Turnpike and Plank Road Companies, wag taken up, read the
              third time, and finally passed the House-yeas 59, nays 16.

            Mr. OSBORN made an ineffectual motion to take up the railroad bill [S. 330.] 

            On motion of Mr. STEPHENSON, the House took up the consideration of the Senate
              amendments to Mr. Dunn's Criminal Circuit Court Judges bill [H. R. 334.]

            The House then took a recess till two o'clock. 

          
          

          
            AFTERNOON SESSION.

            Mr. BRITTON, from the special committee thereon, returned the Medical Profession bill
              [S. 75], recommending its passage.

            Mr. RATLIFF submitted an order for allowance of mileage to Wm. M. Merwin and John O.
              Hardesty for traveling to the city for the organization of the House at this special
              session, which was adopted by consent. 


          
            THE MORGAN RAID BILL.

            The SPEAKER announced the special order-the Senate amendments to the Morgan raid
              bill.

            Mr. GORDON moved to postpone the special order till Friday, 10 o'clock.

            Mr. COFFROTH proposed to amend the motion so as postpone till to-morrow (Thursday),
              10 o'clock.

            Mr. RUDDELL proposed Friday, 10 o'clock, which he subsequently withdrew.

            Mr. FULLER moved to lay the motion and amendments on the table, which was
              rejected-yeas 43, nays 43. Mr. DUNN proposed to amend further by making the
              postponement till 3 o'clock and 10 minutes Friday afternoon. 

            Mr. DAVIS of Floyd moved that it be laid on the table, and demanded a call of the
              House, which determined 86 members present. 

            On motion of Mr. LAMBORN the absentees were sent for, and the order made and executed
              accordingly Montgomery, Osborn, Shoaff and Stephenson appeared, were excused, and took
              their seats.

            And then on motion of Mr. WILDMAN  further
              proceedings under the call were dispensed with-yeas 55, nays 35.

            Mr. Davis' motion to lay the amendment on the table was rejected-yeas 43, nays
              46-and the question recurred-

            Mr. UNDERWOOD demanded the previous Question.

            Mr. COFFROTH urged Mr. Underwood to withdraw the demand and consent to postpone the
              subject till to-morrow morning 10 o'clock, thinking that we would get along
              better this afternoon, and come here tomorrow with minds better prepared to act on
              this question.

            Mr. UNDERWOOD adhered to his demand, but the House refused the second affirmative 39,
              negative 43.

            Mr. COFFROTH'S motion was then agreed to, so the subject was postponed
              accordingly. 
      
          
            
            
          
            BRANCH RAILROADS.

            On motion of Mr. OSBORN, the bill [S. 330] to
              amend the first section of the act of December 19, 1865, so as to enable railroads to
              construct branch roads to neighboring coal mines, was taken up and read the first time
              by title, and, on his farther motion, (the constitutional restriction being removed
              for the purpose,) the bill was considered on its final passage.

            Mr. OSBORN said the single object was to enable railroads to take charge of such
              branch roads, already built, in co-operation with citizens.

            The bill was finally passed the House of Representatives-yeas 79, nays 1. 

          
          

          
            COUNTY LINE BRIDGES.

            On motion of Mr. BATES, (the restriction having been removed for the purpose) the
              bill [S. 284] to provide for the erection and
              repairs of any bridges over streams forming a boundary line between two counties, was
              taken up on the second reading and put upon its passage.

            It was finally passed the House-yeas 72, nays 9 

          
          

          
            SUPPLEMENTAL SPECIFIC BILL.

            On motion of Mr. STANTON, the consideration of the Supplementary Specific bill [H. R.
              395] making appropriations for special session, was taken upyeas 60, nays 19 - the
              question being on Mr. Dunn's amendment to strike out the item for fifteen hundred
              dollars for stamps and stationary for the special session on the part of House.

            Mr. COFFROTH made the point (which was sustained) that the gentleman can not move to
              strike out what the House has inserted in the bill by amendment.

            Mr. DUNN then moved to reconsider the vote adopting that item, and thereon he
              demanded the previous question, and under its operation the House agreed to
              reconsider-yeas 50, nays 31-and the question recurred on the adoption of the item
              appropriating fifteen dollars to each member for stamps and stationery for the special
              session.

            The item was rejected-yeas 6, nays 74-Mr. McDonald explaining, that he submitted the
              item, not in the faith that it would be adopted as it was. He voted
              "no."

            Mr. McDONALD moved to reconsider the vote of yesterday adopting the item for the
              allowance of one hundred and ten dollars for Samuel Beatty, to reimburse his expenses
              in the Beatty-Peelle contest.

            On motion of Mr. COFFROTH the motion was laid on the table-yeas 54, nays-22.

            He then moved ineffectually, to reconsider the vote by which the item for allowance
              of ninety-nine dollars to James R, Peelle, to reimburse to him his expenses incurred
              in the Beatty-Peelle contest.

            Mr. CORY proposed to amend the bill by striking out the item to appropriate one
              month's pay (thirteen dollars) to each of the one hundred and fourteen men of
              Captain Steinberger's command, called out to repel the invasion of Kirby Smith.
              He alleged that more than twenty thousand men could claim pay for repelling that
              invasion with as good a show of right as the men of this command.

            Mr. VATER moved ineffectually to lay the amendment on the table-yeas 17, nays 51.

            Mr. DITTEMORE made an ineffectual motion to adjourn-yeas 24, nays 50.

            Mr. JOHNSON, of Parke, demanded the previous question, and under its force, the item
              was stricken out-yeas 56, nays 23.

            Mr. STANTON now demanded the previous question on the order for engrossment, and
              there was a second-Mr. WILLIAMS, of Knox, desiring to offer an amendment.

            So the bill was ordered to the engrossment and third reading, considered as engrossed
              and read the third time.

            Mr. DITTEMORE moved to recommit the bill to the Committee on
                Claims, with instructions to strike out the item for allowance of $2,119
              to Daniel Keely and sons for services as musicians.

            Mr. DAVIS, of Floyd, took the floor and spoke at length in favor of the motion to
              recommit with instructions to amend. He desired also to add instructions to the
              committee to amend by striking out the allowances to sundry persons for services as
              witnesses before the committee on arbitrary arrests for the session of 1863; also to
              strike out the allowances for expenses incurred by the parties to the Beatty-Pealle
              contest which was determined at the last session of  the Forty-Sixth General Assembly. But, not being reduced
              to writing, his propositions were not entertained at this time. Before he had
              concluded, and giving way for the purpose-

            Mr. COFFROTH moved that the House adjourn-which was decided in the negative-yeas 40,
              nays 44.

            Mr. STANTON submitted the point, that, when a gentleman yields the floor for a motion
              to adjourn, he loses his right to the floor.

            The SPEAKER ruled against the point of order.

            Mr. COFFROTH submitted the same point, and proposed to appeal from this ruling.
              Pending which-

            The House adjourned. 

          
          
          
          
        
        

        
          IN SENATE.
          
             THURSDAY, May 13, 1869.
          

          The Senate met at 9 o'clock A. M.

          On motion by Mr. ROBINSON, of Decatur, the reading of the Secretary's minutes of
            yesterday was dispensed with.

          On his further motion, the bill [H. R. 158] to
            amend section twenty-five of an act entitled "an act to provide for the valuation
            and assessment of real and personal property, and the collection of taxes in the State
            of Indiana; for the election of Township Assessors, and prescribing the duties of
            Assessors, Appraisers of real property, County Treasurers and Auditors, and the
            Treasurer and Auditor of State;" approved June 21, 1852, was read the third
            time.

          Mr. ROBINSON, of Decatur, explained that it proposes to amend said section by inserting
            after the words " specifically taxed," the following: "Provided that if
            any such person shall have converted moneys, credits, or other personal property, in the
            year preceding the first day of January of the current year, into bonds or other
            securities of the United States, and shall hold or control said bonds or other
            securities when he is required to list his property, he shall list the monthly average
            value of such moneys, credits or other property thus converted while such moneys,
            credits or other property were held or controlled by him; and provided further, that any
            indebtedness of such person or persons represented by him, created by investment in said
            bonds or other securities, shall not be deducted from the amount of credits in making up
            his list for taxation."

          The bill passed by yeas 33, nays 8.

          Mr. JAQUESS, as a privileged question, offered the following resolution, which was
            adopted:

          
            
              
                WHEREAS, It has been reported on the streets and elsewhere,
                  that a corruption fund had been made use of to procure the passage of House bill
                  No. 119, commonly known as the Morgan raid bill, and-

                WHEREAS, said charge rests alike on every member of this
                  Legislature. Now, in order that said charges may be fully investigated and the
                  guilty parties be exposed, if there be any such, and the innocent be exhonerated.
                  Therefore be it -

                Resolved, that a committee of three be appointed to investigate
                  said charges, and that they be instructed to report the result of their
                  investigation to this Senate, and that they have power to send for papers and
                  witnesses.
              
            
          

          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR thereupon appointed Messrs. Jaquess, Gray and Laselle to said
            committee.

          On motion of Mr. RICE, the bill [H. R. 97], a
            bill authorizing certain County Auditors to correct their reports to the Superintendent
            of Public Instruction relative to the school fund, common and congressional, as required
            by an act entitled "An act requiring County Auditors to make ex animation of the
            records in their office in relation to school funds, and make report and providing
            compensation therefor," approved December 21, 1865, and declaring an emergency, was
            taken up, and, under a dispensation, it was read the second time by title, again by
            sections and put upon its passage.

          The bill passed by yeas 41, nays 3. 

          
            MUNICIPAL TAXATION OF BANK SHARES.

            On motion by Mr. GRAY, the bill [H. R. 170], a bill to provide for the assessment and
              collection of taxes for municipal, purposes on the shares of stock owned in banks or
              banking associations doing business in this State, was taken up.

            The majority of the Committee made a lengthy printed report against its passage and
              the minority presented written reason why the bill should become a law.

            Mr. HANNA moved to make this subject the special order for 2 o'clock to-day in
                Committee of the Whole.

            Mr. GRAY preferred its consideration at once and now.

            Mr. GREEN was of opinion that if the Senate went into Committee of the
                Whole this would close up all legislation for this session.

            Mr. CRAVENS did not propose to contribute to dodging the result of the consideration
              of the Constitutional Amendment: and as much business of importance was before us, he
              moved to indefinitely postpone the bill.

            Mr. MORGAN declared there was now $11,000,009 in the hands of wealthy men escaping
              taxation for municipal purpose; and he regarded this bill as important a measure as
              has been before this Legislature; consequently it should be acted upon now.

            Mr. GRAY did not understand that our rules require this bill to be discussed in the
                Committee of the Whole as is contended by the Senator from
              Sullivan and others. 

            

            Mr CHURCH undertook to say the country districts did not demand that this measure
              should be passed; and he was inot disposed to lay aside the important legislation of
              this session for the consideration of this bill.

            Mr. GRAY showed an invidious distinction made by the present law as between
              investments in bank stocks and investments in the mercantile business, and declared
              that this bill would remedy it. The question of justice is the most important one to
              be discussed and acted upon in any legislative body, and this bill should claim
              immediate attention by the Senate.

            Mr. CARSON also regarded this as very important measure; as one called for by one
              hundred thousand people of Indiana, and one reccommended by the Chief Executive
              officer of the Sttae in his message to the Legislature.

            Mr. CRAVENS made his motion not to avoid a decision by the Senate, for he felt
              convinced this matter would have to be adjudicated by the Courts, and it could be sent
              to the Courts as well without the bill as with it. He demanded the previous
              question.

            The Senate seconded the demand.

            The motion to indefinitely postpone the bill was agreed to by yeas 26, nays 21-as
              follows:

            
              
                
                  Yeas-Messrs. Andrews, Beardsley, Bird,Case, Church, Cravens, Denbo, Elliott,
                    Fisher, Clifford Hadley, Hamilton, Hanna, Hooper, Huey, Jaquess, Montgomery,
                    Rice, Reynolds, Robinson of Madison, Robinson of Decatur, Scott, Sherrod, Stein,
                    Wolcott and Wood-26.

                  Nays-Messrs. Armstrong, Bellamy, Bradley, Carson, Caven, Fosdick, Gray, Green,
                    Henderson, Hess, Humphreys, Johnson of Spencer, Johnson of Montgomery, Kinley,
                    Laselle, Lee, Morgan, Smith, Taggart and Turner-21.
                
              
            

            Pending the roll call-

            Several Senators-Messers. Hanna, Gifford and Andrews-explained their affirmative
              votes in language similar to-

            Mr. SHERROD, who said: It is evident that this bill can not get the necessary
              constitutional vote to pass it. It is therefore a waste of time to discuss it, and
              especially at this late hour of the session, when there are so many measures waiting
              the action of the Senate in which the people are directly interested. I shall
              therefore vote for the indefinite postponement.

            So the motion to indefinitely postpone the bill was agreed to.

            Mr. WOLCOTT-having changed his vote for that purpose-moved to reconsider the vote
              just taken.

            On motion by Mr. CHURCH, this motion was laid on the table by yeas 25, nays 20.

            On motion by Mr. KINLEY, the bill [H. R. 288] to amend sections 4 and 8 of the liquor
              law of March 5 1859 was read by title second time, and the third time by sections.

            Mr. TURNER, although intending to vote against the passage of this bill, voted to
              take it up that the party opposed to him in politics which has pretended for the last
              ten years to be, and have obtained a large vote in this state on the ground that they
              were temperance men, when practically they were no more so than us, who do not make
              that profession-that, these gentlemen may now have an opportunity of manifesting the
              truth of their pretensions.

            The bill failed to pass by yeas 22, nays 23-as follows:

            
              
                
                  YEAS.-Messrs. Andrews, Armstrong, Bellamy, Case, Church,
                    Cravens, Eliott, Fosdick, Gray, Green, Hadley, Hamilton, Hess, Hooper, Johnson
                    of Spencer, Kinley, Reynolds. Robinson of Madison, Robinson of Decatur, Scott,
                    Stein, Wood-22.

                  NAYS.-Messrs. Beardsley, Bird, Bradley, Carson, Caven,
                    Fisher. Gifford, Hanna, Henderson, Huey, Huffman, Humphreys, Jaquess, Johnson of
                    Montgomery, Laselle, Lee, Montgomery, Morgan, Rice, Sherrod, Smith, Turner,
                    Wolcott23. 
                
              
            

          
          

          
            THE FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT.

            Mr. HOOPER moved to suspend the order of business in order that he might introduce a
              joint resolution accepting and ratifying a certain amendment to the Constitution of
              the United States, which he sent to the Secretary's desk, and had read for
              information.

            Mr. SHERROD moved to lay the motion to suspend the order of business on the
              table.

            Mr. RICE. I understand the object of this motion is simply to get the resolution
              before the Senate, and move to take it up to-morrow at 2 o'clock.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR, It is not before the Senate. The Senator had it read for
              information.

            Mr. SHERROD. I withdraw my motion.

            Mr. SMITH. I regard this as a trick, and you can't do it.

            Mr. STEIN. Inasmuch as the remark, has been made that this resolution is brought up
              for the purpose of making it the order for to-morrow, I, for one, will, move at once
              the ratification of the amendment as soon as it is before this body.

            The motion to postpone was rejected by yeas 19, nays 25, as follows:

            
              
                
                   YEAS-Messrs. Andrews, Armstrong, Beardsley Bellamy, Case,
                    Caven, Cravens, Fisher,Fosdick, Gray, Green, Hamilton, Hess, Hooper, Kinley,
                    Robinson, of Madison, Stein, Wolcott, and Wood-19.

                  NAYS-Messrs. Bird, Bradley, Carson, Church, Eliott, Gifford,
                    Hadley, Hanna, Henderson, Huey, Huffman, Humphreys, Jaquess, Johnson of Spencer,
                    Johnson of Montgomery, Laselle, Lee, Morgan, Rice, Reynolds, Robinson, of
                    Decatur, Scott, Sherrod, Smith, and Turner-25.
                
              
            

            Pending roll-call-

            Mr. CHURCH, when his name was called said: On all occasions I have given Democrats to
              understand that this thing should  not be taken
              up, but should be fixed for a certain time. I vote against taking it up, and if it is
              sprang to take advantage of the position I take I shall vote against the amendment. I
              made no bargains to get Democrats into the House, but alter they got in I regarded
              this thing as virtually gone until the business of the session was completed; and I
              shall vote against taking it up. I vote "no."

            Mr. FISHER, when his name was called, said: My object in voting to suspend the rules
              is for the express purpose of moving to postpone the resolution till 2 o'clock
              tomorrow. I vote "aye."

            Mr. GRAY, when his name was called, said: I am going to vote to suspend the rules,
              and go with the Senator from Tippecanoe [Mr. Stein] to close this Legislature as soon
              as possible. I don't think it is doing any good, and the sooner it adjourns the
              better for the people. I vote "aye."

            Mr. HADLEY desired to be found acting in good faith, saw no necessity for this
              motion, and as the quickest way to remove this trouble voted "no."

            Mr. HOOPER, when his name was called said: I desire to say in explanation that while
              the main object in making; this motion to suspend the rules is to get this resolution
              before the body, I do not want any Senator to be mistaken as to my position. I wish to
              get it before the Senate, and the Senate may then make such disposition of it as they
              see proper. If a majority deem it right to postpone it till to-morrow that is their
              act and not mine. I want to get this question before the body. While Senators are
              talking about important measures, I hold that this is the most important measure of
              the whole session. Those minor matters of legislation which Legislatures coming after
              us may make and repeal, should give way to this. I desire this question to come before
              this body. As it now stands it is not before this body at all. I intend to vote for it
              the first opportunity. I vote "aye."

            Mr. LASELLE, when his name was called, said: It seems to me it is properly Before the
              Senate now, and the only thing necessary is to take it up. It can be taken up
              to-morrow as well as now, and therefore I vote "no."

            Mr. MORGAN, when his name was called, said: When the regular session broke up it
              caught me without my stamps, but I am ready for it now. [Laughter.] I don't want
              to cast my vote to take up or not take up this thing; but if I am compelled to vote
              now, I say "no."

            Mr. ROBINSON of Madison, when his name was called, said: We passed a resolution last
              week that this matter would be postponed till to-morrow. But it was set for Tuesday.
              That thing has never been taken up, and I propose by my vote to take it up and let it
              be referred till tomorrow. I vote "aye."

            So the motion to suspend the rules was rejected.

            And then came the recess till 2 o'clock 

          
          

          
            AFTERNOON SESSION.

            Mr. GIFFORD demanded a call of the Senate.

            The roll was called and discovered but 26 members present.

            On motion by Mr. BELLAMY the Doorkeeper was ordered to bring in the absentees.

            On motion by Mr. HOOPER the doors were ordered to be locked.

            The call was continued, and after waiting about half an hour-several Senators having
              appeared-

            The PRESIDENT pro tem, [Mr. Green in the
              chair] announced that there were 34 Senators present.

            Mr. STEIN. Mr. President, I move that further proceedings under the call be dispensed
              with.

            The motion was agreed to.

            Mr. STEIN. Do I understand that there are 34 Senators present?

            The PRESIDENT pro tem. That is what the
              Secretary says; I don't know. I am informed by the Secretary that 34 Senators
              answered to their names.

            Mr. WOLCOTT. Mr. President, a rumor is floating about here, and authenticated
              somewhat, that while the Democratic members of the House have resigned the members of
              the Senate have not.

            Mr. CRAVENS interrupting. I would like to correct the Senator from White, (Mr.
              Walcott,) I have seen the resignation of eleven Senators just handed into the
              Governor's office.

            Mr. STEIN. That is not enough.

            Mr. CRAVENS. That is not enough to break a quorum.

            Mr. STEIN. I now more that the Senate be called. We want to make a record here this
              afternoon and I trust we will proceed in order.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR baring resumed the chair, directed the Secretary to call the
              Senate.

            Mr. CASE. I move the doors be closed.

            The motion was agreed to.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. The doorkeeper will strictly enforce the order.

            The call of the Senate was proceeded with and when, (at eighteen minutes before 3
              o'clock P. M.,) the Secretary called "Mr. Carson,"
              that gentleman responded, "I am not a Senator of the State of Indiana."

            Mr. STEIN. I move that the Clerk certify that Mr. Carson is present. We have  no certificate showing that he is not a Senator
              and he is here present.

            Mr. JOHNSTON, of Montgomery. I object. He is no longer a Senator, and you have no
              right to so certify.

            The roll call was continued, and when Mr. Morgan's name was called that
              gentleman said: "I dont know whether I am a Senator or not." The call having
              been completed-

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR said: Thirty-five Senators answered to their names.

            Mr. LASELLE. Mr. Smith informs me that he has resigned.

            Mr. GREEN and several Senators. "He is in the chamber."

            Mr. LASELLE continuing, was not heard at the Reporter's desk distinctly, but was
              understood to say that he desired to see Senators act in good faith. The Senator from
              Orange [Mr. Sherrod] tells me that he has resigned, and the Senator from Allen [Mr.
              Carson] has told you that he is no longer a Senator. The latter Senator has
              contemplated resigning to-day for some time, having made arrangements to go to
              Europe.

            Mr. CRAVENS. Mr. President, I made a statement of the fact that I had seen the
              resignation of eleven Senators handed in to the Governor-the eleven whose time expires
              with this present session. That would leave the Senate with 39 members. With the
              absent Senators-Mr. Hughes and Mr. Colley-it leaves us still 37 members. We are still
              a working body, and if there is anything desired to be done, now I suppose is as good
              a time to do it as any other.

            Mr. STEIN. Mr. President: Do I understand that there is a quorum present?

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. As far as the roll shows there is.

            Mr. SHERROD. I desire to say that I suppose I am no longer a Senator. I have been
              informed that my resignation has been handed in and [His further remarks were drowned
              by cries of "order," "order," " you are not a Senator, you
              have no right-to speak," etc.] 

            Mr. STEIN. Mr. President: I move that further proceedings under the call be dispensed
              with, and that the doors remain closed.

            Mr. JOHNSTON, of Montgomery. You cannot do business with closed doors, unless in the
              opinion of the Senate it is absolutely necessary to enjoin secrecy, because the
              Constitution expressly requires that "the doors of each House, and of the
                Committee of the Whole, shall be kept open, except in such cases
              as, in the opinion of either House, may require secrecy." If there is anything to
              be done now that requires secrecy, it is in the power of the Senate to close the
              doors; but, if not, it is not in your power to close the doors without violating the
              Constitution.

            Mr. WOLCOTT. Mr. President: I move this resolution, which I will write: That in the
              opinion of the Senate the emergency of affairs at this time requires secrecy.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. Put your resolution in writing.

            Mr. FOSDICK. Mr. President: I think it very important that this matter should be kept
              secret. It is necessary that it should be kept from the Senators' constituencies
              [pointing to the empty benches on the Democratic side], and consequently of the utmost
              importance that the doors shall be closed.

            Mr. JOHNSTON of Montgomery. Mr. President-

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. The Senator from White [Mr. Wolcott] offers the following
              resolution:

            The Secretary read:

            
              Resolved, That in the opinion of the Senate, the emergency of the
              business pending before the Senate requires secrecy, and that the doors be kept
              closed.

            Mr. JOHNSTON of Montgomery. That does not meet the constitutional objection to the
              closing of the doors; but if that is to be the order of the Senate, you must clear the
              lobby; there must not be a spectator in here-not one.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. [To the Secretary.] Call the Senator from Franklin.

            Mr. GIFFORD. I am no longer a member.

            Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, I do not know how to look upon this-as a big joke, or
              whether we are in earnest or not.

            SEVERAL SENATORS-"In earnest."

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. Let us have order; let us be in earnest about that at any
              rate.

            Mr. SCOTT. If we are acting in earnest there must be some reason for secrecy.
              "We are acting, as I understand it, in the ordinary manner, and there is nothing
              in the resolution throwing any light on my mind as to why this requires secrecy. I
              would like to ask the Senator from White [Mr. Wolcott] what it is that requires
              secrecy?

            Mr. WOLCOTT. Let every Senator determine this matter for himself.

            Mr. CHURCH (in his seat.) I am afraid my wife will hear about it. [Laughter.]

            Mr. SCOTT. If it is a joke I enjoy it hugely. If in earnest, I am not going to sit
              here and vote for a proceeding of this kind without giving my objection. What is the
              matter before this body? It is, or will be, the Constitutional amendment. Will the
              Senator say that is a matter requiring secrecy?
              Does any gentleman on this floor pretend that is a matter requiring secrecy?

            Mr. WOLCOTT (interposing). To relieve the Senator, I will withdraw the
              resolution.

            Mr. HOOPER. Mr. President, now I move the adoption of the resolution I send up.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR [to the Secretary]. Read.

            The Secretary read as follows:

            A joint resolution accepting and ratifying a certain amendment to the Constitution of
              the United States,

            

            
              
                
                  WHEREAS, Congress has, by a two-thirds vote, proposed to the
                    Legislatures of the several States as an amendment to the Constitution of the
                    United States, which, when ratified by the Legislatures of three-fourths of the
                    States shall be valid to all intents and purposes as a part of said
                    Constitution, namely:

                  
                    ARTICLE XV.

                    SECTION 1st. The rights of the citizens of the United
                      States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States, or by any
                      State on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude.

                    SEC. 2. The Congress shall have power to enforce this by
                      appropriate legislation.

                    Therefore, be it resolved by the General Assembly of the State
                        of Indiana, That said Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the
                      United States is hereby accepted and ratified on the part of the State of
                      Indiana.
                  
                  

                
                
              
            

            Mr. BEARDSLEY. Mr. President, I move the previous question.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. Those in favor of seconding the demand for the previous
              question will say "aye;' those opposed say "no." In the opinion of
              the Chair the previous question is seconded. Call the roll on the adoption of the
              resolution.

            The Secretary proceeded with the roll call, and the vote resulted as follows:

            
              
                
                  YEAS-Messrs. Andrews, Armstrong, Beardsley, Bellamy, Case,
                    Caven, Church, Cravens, Eliott, Fisher, Fosdick, Gray, Green, Hadley, Hamilton,
                    Hess, Hooper, Johnson of Spencer, Kinley, Rice, Reynold, Robinson of Madison,
                    Robinson of Decatur, Scott, Stein, Wolcott and Wood-27.

                  NAY-Mr. Jaquess-1. 
                
              
            

            Pending the roll call-

            When Mr. Gifford's name was called, Mr. CHURCH said: "Present, but not
              voting."

            Mr. GIFFORD replied: "My resignation has been accepted by the
              Governor."

            When Mr. Johnston of Montgomery's name was called, Mr. GREEN said:
              "Present, but not voting."

            Mr. CHURCH. I would like to have it put down that he is present, but not voting.

            When Mr. Laselle's name was called, Mr. CHURCH said: "Present, but not
              voting."

            Mr. LASALLE replied: "I understand my resignation has been tendered and
              accepted."

            Mr. CHURCH. I would like to have him put down as present and not voting.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR Call the roll through-we will fix that all right.

            Mr. GRAY. According to the roll call awhile ago there was a quorum in the chamber;
              and Senators now say they no longer Senators on this floor.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. We will dispose of this question when we get through with
              the roll.

            When Mr. Lee's name was called. Mr CHURCH said: "Present, but not
              voting" 

            Mr. SCOTT, when his name was called said: I want to say in explanation of this vote
              that I believe this Senate by its action week has postponed this matter until
              to-morrow. I am sure that it is a matter of record. I understand that a man's
              word is his bond, I don't care whether by a resolution before the Senate or
              whether a thousand miles away. I understand that to be the determination of this
              body.

            Mr. HOOPER, (interrupting). I will ask the Senator if the action of the minority in
              tendering their resignations, as we are informed, and thus breaking a quorum, does not
              relieve us from our obligation in that direction.

            Mr. SCOTT. Wait till I get to the point and I will relieve the Senator, I think, to
              his satisfaction. But, sir, under the present exigencies of the case, finding that
              these Senators have withdrawn from this body, riot being willing to take that promise
              as a matter of faith from us, in common integrity and fairness among men, I feel
              myself discharged, and this Senate discharged, from all obligation from the first day
              we stepped into this hall to this moment, and for that reason I am willing to cast my
              vote for this resolution, [Applause.] I vote "aye."

            When Mr. Sherrod's name was called, that gentleman said: "I have already
              announced my resignation" [The remainder of the sentence was not heard because of
              cries of "order," and "I object."] 

            When Mr. Smith's name was called, Mr. ROBINSON, of Madison, said: "Present,
              but not voting."

            The roll call having been completed-

            The LIEUTENANT GONERNOR said: The Secretary reports the following facts: Twenty-seven
              ayes, one no, and ten present, but not voting. [Applause, cheers and shouts.]Mr.
              STEIN. I offer the following resolution.

            The Secretary read:

            
              
                
                  
                    Resolved, That it be entered on the journal of the Senate that
                    upon the call of the yeas and nays upon the passage of the joint resolution
                    ratifying the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the
                    following Senators we present but declined voting, viz: 

                  
                    Mr. Carson, Senator from Allen;
                    Mr. Gifford, Senator from Franklin;
                    Mr. Henderson, Senator from Morgan;
                    Mr. Laselle, Senator from Cass;
                    Mr. Lee, Senator from Bartholomew;
                    Mr. Morgan, Senator from Vanderburg;

                    

                    Mr. Sherrod, Senator from Orange.
                    Mr. Smith, Senator from Huntington;
                    Mr. Denbo Senator from Harrison;
                    Mr Johnson, Senator from Montgomery.

                  
                
              
            

            Mr. SHERROD. I enter my solemn protest against my name being counted when I am not a
              Senator in the State of Indiana.

            Mr. GIFFORD. I want the journal to show that I was present but announced to the
              Senate that my resignation was handed in and accepted.

            Mr. CHURCH. Mr. President: If the Senator has resigned, he has no business talking
              here.

            Mr. JOHNSTON, of Montgomery. They have resigned, and consequently you have no right
              to put their names there at all. The names reported as present but not voting should
              be called so that we may know whether they have resigned or not.

            Mr. KINLEY. Mr. President: The Senators from Franklin (Mr. Gifford) and Orange (Mr.
              Sherrod) both recognize themselves as Senators by speaking on the floor since the
              passage of the joint resolution.

            Mr. CRAVENS. Mr. President: I think the pending resolution is perfectly proper and
              should be entered on the journal, for the simple reason that the gentlemen whose names
              are mentioned were in the body of the Senate; we have no official information of their
              resignation, and until such official information is here, we have to recognize them as
              Senators.

            Mr. JOHNSTON, of Montgomery. Mr. President-

            Mr. STEIN. I call for the previous question.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR put the question to the Senate and said: I think the previous
              question is seconded. As many as favor the passage of the resolution will say
              "aye;" those opposed say "no." The resolution is adopted.

            Several Senators now addressed the Chair; one of them making a motion to adjourn.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR put we question (while "Mr. President" was being
              called) and thereupon declared the Senate adjourned till 9 o'clock to-morrow
              morning.

            NOTE - The reasons urged by Mr. Wolcott for the support of the
              claim of J. A. Coburn for two per cent. commission on the amount of claims against the
              United States settled by him were, first, that he was entitle to such commission by
              the terms of the agreement made by the authority of Governor Baker, on the
              recommendation of the leading official and representative men of this State at
              Washington; and the only questions proper to be inquired into by the Legislature were,
              first, Did the exigency of affairs in respect to our account with the Government of
              the United States justify such an arrangement, and if such an arrangement was
              justified, was this arrangement the best that could be made? Undisputed facts proving
              the necessity of such an arrangment, and the actual economy of the one made, the
              Legislature was equitably bound to ratify the contract; and any refusal to do so was
              an unjust disavowal of the action of our State officers, which action had redounded to
              the undoubted very material advantage of the State. 

          
          

        
        

        

          HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.

          Mr. STEWART, of Rush, moved to dispense with the reading of the journal of
            yesterday.

          Mr. COFFROTH demanded the yeas and nays-the vote resulting, yeas 46, nays 5.

          Mr. JOHNSON, of Marshall, moved ineffectually, that the House do now adjourn.

          Mr. VATER moved a call,,of the House, which determined fifty-one members present and
            answering to their names.

          Mr. RATLIFF moved that the doors be closed and the Doorkeeper be dispatched for the
            absentees.

          Mr. BOWEN submitted the excuse for for the absence of his colleague, Mr. Underwood,
            just received by dispatch.

          Mr. STANTON moved that the House do now adjourn, the vote resulting-yeas 36, nays 15-as
            follows:

          
            
              
                 YEAS-Messrs. Baker, Barnett, Beatty, Bowen, Breckinridge,
                  Chapman, Chittenden, Dunn, Fairchild, Field of Lake, Field of Lagrange, Furnas,
                  Gilham, Greene, Hall, Hamilton, Higbee, Hutson, Johnson of Parke, Johnson of
                  Marshall, Jump, Kercheval, Lamborn, Millekan, Miller, Pierce of Vigo, Ruddell,
                  Skidmore, Smith, Stanton, Stewart of Ohio, Stewart of Rush, Vater, Williams of
                  Hamilton, Williams of Union, and Wilson-36.

                NAYS-Messrs. Beeler, Coffroth, Cox, Davidson, Davis of
                  Elkhart, Gordon, Higgins, Mason, Mitchell, Overmyer, Ratliff, Sabin, Stephenson,
                  Taber, and Mr. Speaker-15.
              
            
          

          Mr. RATLIFF, explaining his negative vote, said, We need a few more members to pass a
            Specific Appropriation bill which we have been talking about for a month or two; and,
            preferring to wait for a quorum for that purpose, he voted "no."

          Mr. COFFROTH, in his seat. There is no member absent for any such purpose.

          Mr. DUNN desired to change his vote from the negative to the affirmative, and submitted
            his reasons for so doing. He said: I vote aye; and I do it because I understand that,
            when the hour of 10 o'clock arrives, we are to have a quorum. If the purpose of the
            minority on this floor is to defeat necessary legislation, because the majority have
            chosen to postpone and make a certain proposition the special order for a certain time,
            I am in favor of availing ourselves of the parliamentary rule to adjourn this body till
            2 o'clock.

          So the House took a recess till 2 o'clock. 

          
            AFTERNOON SESSION.

            The SPEAKER resumed the Chair at 2 o'clock.

            Mr. OVERMYER submitted the following, which was read for information:

            

            
              Resolved, That the House will proceed instanter upon the amendments
              of the (Senate to the specific appropriation bill, and, after not exceeding two hours
              consideration, will proceed to vote finally upon said amendments. That, at 4
              o'clock P. M., or as soon as the specific appropriation bill
              shall be disposed of, (not later than the hour of 4 o'clock P.
                M.) the House will take up the bill [H. R. 119] known as the Morgan raid bill,
              and proceed at once to concur or non-concur in the amendments of the Senate thereto,
              without any motion to adjourn, or any dillatory motion whatever.

            Mr. JOHNSON, of Marshall, and Mr. DAVIS, of Floyd, moved to lay the resolution on the
              table.

            The SPEAKER. The resolution was read simply for information. It was with the House to
              consider it or not. The Chair hears objection.

            Mr. RATLIFF moved, that the House now take up the consideration of the Senate
              amendments to the Specific Appropriation bill [H. R.
                311] reported yesterday by message; and, thereupon, he demanded the previous
              question.

            Mr. COFFROTH, on the statement of the order, insisted that no vote for consent having
              been taken, Mr. Overmyer's resolution is before the House, and Mr. Ratliff's
              motion is an amendment thereto.

            The SPEAKER overruled the point submitted.

            Mr. WILLIAMS, of Knox, desired to submit Mr. Overmeyer's resolution as an
              substitute-amendment for Mr. Ratliff's motion.

            The SPEAKER said there was a demand for the previous question, and the amendment
              could not be entertained.In the confusion which was here variously interposed, a
              motion was made and carried for a call of the House, which was ordered and proceeded,
              reporting eighty-three members present.

            Mr. CHITTENDEN moved to dispense with further proceedings under this call.

            Mr. COFFROTH demanded the yeas and nays; and the vote was ordered and the call of the
              roll proceeded.

            Mr. OSBORN interposed, and said he was informed that there are really but few
              Democratic members in the House. That most of them have resigned. And, therefore, the
              House being without a quorum, I move to adjourn till to-morrow morning.

            The SPEAKER. There is no official information of the fact of any resignations of
              members.

            Mr. OSBORN. I have just come from the Executive office, and the resignations are
              there.

            The SPEAKER. The Chair having no official information of the matter, the roll will
              proceed. And when Mr. Lawler's name was called-

            Mr. OSBORN interposing. I object to the gentleman's voting. He is not a member
              of this House. [A voice, "I am glad of the objection."]

            Mr. GORDON insisted that the gentlemen should be called and treated as a member.

            The SPEAKER. The Chair holds that gentlemen must be treated as members here, till we
              are officially informed otherwise.

            Mr. PIERCE, of Vigo. Would it be proper to ask a gentleman, who is not now but has
              been heretofore a member, whether he is a member or not?

            The SPEAKER. The Chair thinks it would not. And Mr. Lawler's name being again
              called by the Clerk-

            Mr. DAVIS, of Floyd, interposed. Mr Speaker, Mr. Lawler has requested me to state to
              the House that he is no longer a member of this body, and desires not to be
              called.

            Mr. COFFROTH, interposing. I take it that when a gentleman announces here that he is
              not a member, that is sufficient information.

            The SPEAKER again directed the call of the roll to be proceeded with; and when the
              names of Mr. McBride and Mr. McDonald were called, they arose and declared
              respectively, That having dissolved their connection with this House, they decline to
              vote.

            Mr. PIERCE, of Porter, interposing. I object to gentlemen being excused so long as
              they are in their places here.

            Mr. CHITTENDEN, interposing. I move that the House adjourn till to-morrow morning at
              9 o'clock.

            The SPEAKER. The motion is not in order pending the roll-call: And when Mr. Neffs
              name was called, he said: Within the last few minutes my resignation has been tendered
              to the Executive, and accepted, and I am therefore no longer a member of this body,
              and I-

            Mr. JOHNSTON, of Parke, interposing. If the gentleman is no longer a member of this
              body, I submit that he has no right to address the Speaker.

            The SPEAKER. The chair has no official information that gentlemen have resigned, such
              as would allow the House to act upon it. Mr. Neff then asked that his name be stricken
              from the roll. And when Mr. Sleeth's name was called by the Clerk.

            Mr. DAVIS, of Floyd, said. I am requested by Judge Sleeth to state that he is no
              longer a member of this House.

            The call proceeded; and when the name of Mr. Williams was called for the county of
              Knox, he said: I have handed in my resignation within the last twenty minutes with
              thirty or forty others. My name therefore, need not be called.

            The SPEAKER announced the results of this voteyeas 16, nays 55.
            

            Mr. OSBORN sent up a resolution, which he hoped the House would considder now by
              consent.

            Mr COFFROTH said the question is on the motion of the gentleman from Grant.

            The SPEAKER. The resolution will be read.

            
              
                
                  Resolved, That William M. Mervin, principal Clerk John O.
                    Hardesty, principal Assistant Clerk of the House of Representatives, be each
                    allowed $150 for indexing and reading proofsheets of the House Journal of the
                    Regular Session of 1869 and that the same be allowed to each for the indexing
                    and proof-reading of the House Journal of the Special Session; and that the
                    Sneaker is hereby authorized to issue his warrant for the same.
                
              
            

            The resolution was adopted by consent.

            Mr. DUNN submitted the following, which was read for information:

            
              
                
                  WHEREAS, The honorable members of this House, have, by their
                    resignation, defeated the passage of the Appropriation bill, the Morgan Raid
                    bill, and other business of importance thereby robbing the creditors of the
                    State of Urge sums of money due them; and declaring that the minority, and not
                    the majority should control, thus striking at the foundation of civil society,
                    therefore-

                  Resolved, That while we condemn and censure in act
                    revolutionary in its character, we congratulate the people of the State on their
                    happy deliverance from the curse of a factious minority.
                
              
            

            The SPEAKER now stating that, although there was a quorum voting on the motion to
              dispense with the proceedings on the call of the House, doubt was entertained about
              the result, and he would therefore order that the roll be called again for the vote on
              that motion.

            The order was made accordingly, and the tote resulted-yeas 52, nays 3-as follows:

            
              
                
                   YEAS-Messrs. Baker, Barnett Beatty, Beeler, Bowen,
                    Breckinridge, Chapman, Chittenden, Davidson, Davis of Elkhart, Dunn, Field of
                    Lake, Field of Lagrange, Furnas, Gilham, Gordon, Greene, Hall, Hamilton, Higbee,

            Mr. DUNN explaining and desiring to change his vote said, apologetically: I dislike
              to exchange old friends for new ones. I vote "aye" instead of
              "no."

            So, further proceedings under the call of the House were dispensed with.

            Mr. KERCHEVAL, rising to a question of privilege, called the attention of the House
              to the statement of the gentleman from Knox (Mr Williams), that some twenty minutes
              ago, he, with with forty others, had handed in their resignations; that the result of
              the vote then taken showed that 69 or 70 votes were cast, and the result of the vote
              just announced showed but 55 members present - the House without a quorum voting; and
              that these results of the voting show, either that the gentleman from Knox was
              mistaken, or that gentlemen voted without authority on the result first reported.

            Mr. COFFROTH. Not at all. For while the gentleman, (Mr. Williams, of Knox) although
              the resignations had been submitted within the twenty minutes previous, were waiting,
              both here and going to the Governor's room, and were being informed that their
              resignations were received.

            The SPEAKER then announced-no quorum voting.

            Mr. PIERCE, of Porter submitted the following, which was read:

            
              Resolved, That H. H. Robinson be allowed per diem as reading Clerk,
              from the 8th to the 13th of April,Which was not entertained. 

            Mr. GORDON submitted the following, which was adopted by consent:

            
              
                
                  
                    Resolved, That Thomas B. McCown, Doorkeeper, of this House, be
                    allowed $36 mileage for organizing the special session of the 46th General
                    Assmbly, and that the Speaker issue his warrant for the same.
                
              
            

            Mr. STEWART, of Rush, submitted the following, which was adopted.

            
              
                
                  
                    Resolved, That the Speaker be directed to draw his warrant for
                    $25 to each of the members of the Prison Committee who
                    visited the prisons under direction of the House.
                
              
            

            Mr. STEWART also submitted the following:

            Resolved, That the Journal Clerks he each allowed $1 per day fer extra services after
              the adjournment to-day, during the present session, and that the Speaker is hereby
              directed to draw his warrant, &c.

            Mr. RANDELL submitted the following:

             WHEREAS, It is rumored on every hand that means by no means
              reputable to the friends of the Morgan raid bill are being freely used in the
              interests of said bill; therefore

            Resolved, That a committee of seven be appointed, whose duty it
              shall be to meet instanter and proceed to investigate in accordance with the preamble
              to this resolution, and ascertain if possible the source of the great lobby influence
              which is being exerted in the interest of the Morgan raid bill; and

            Resolved, That said committee shall have power to send for persons
              and papers, and it shall be the duty of said committee to subpoena such witnesses as
              may be found in the lobbies and in the city, place them in separate rooms and examine
              them separately.

            Mr. DAVIS of Floyd, desired to add: That said Committee be directed to inquire
              further into the means employed for the location of the Agricultural College, and for
              the defeating of the Municipal Bank Shares Taxation bill; and also, as to the
              propriety of the proceedings of the Committee on Prisons. [Laughter].

            Mr. COFFROTH The resolution is out of order.

            The SPEAKER. The Chair will take occasion, during the recess, to appoint this  Committee of seven-if he find enough members left
              to compose it.

            Mr. WILLIAMS of Union, submitted a concurrent resolution for printing 1000 copies of
              the journal in the German language.

            Mr. COFFROTH submitted the point that the resolution could not be entertained,
              because there is no quorum present.

            The SPEAKER. The point is well taken.

            Mr COFFROTH submitted the following:

            
              Resolved, That the Governor be respectfully requested to inform this
              House how many, if any, members of this body have tendered their resignations, in
              order that it may appear whether the General Assembly can further prosecute the public
              business for want of a quorum.

            The SPEAKER. It is not competent for the House to do any legislative business, after
              it has been ascertained that there is no quorum present.

            Mr. DAVIDSON moved to close the doors and send for absentees.

            The SPEAKER. The chair is bound to entertain that motion.

            The motion was rejected.

            Mr. GORDON submitted the following:

            WHEREAS, It has become known that the amendment to the
              Constitution of the United States, known as the fifteenth article can not pass at the
              present session of the General Assembly with a quorum present,

            Therefore Resolved, That the further consideration of the subject
              be referred to the people of the State of Indiana for their approval at the next
              general election.

            Objection being made-

            On motion of Mr. RATLIFF,

            The House adjourned. 

          
          

          
            IN HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
            SPEECH OF MR. PIERCE,
            OF PORTER COUNTY,
            On the Divorce Question.

            The divorce bills of the House and Senate being under consideration, Mr. Pierce, of
              Porter, offered a substitute for the bills, which substitute provides:

            First. That every summons in a divorce case where the defendant is a resident of the
              State shall be served by reading, and not by copy, except in cases where the defendant
              is endeavoring to elude or avoid process, of which fact full proof shall be made.

            Second. That when a divorce has been, or may hereafter be decreed between parties
              resident of the State, and service has been had by copy, the case may be opened up, in
              all matters relating to property, as now provided in case of non-resident
              defendants.

            Third. The Court shall examine the plaintiff, and such other witnesses as it may deem
              proper, (in cases where the defendant is a non-resident) touchin7 the character of his
              or her residence, and if appears that he or she came into the State for the purpose of
              obtaining a divorce, shall dismiss the case without further hearing.

            Mr. Pierce then said: "Mr. Speaker. Many bills have been introduced into the
              House and Senate upon this subject, and a deep feeling is manifested through the
              entire State regarding this matter.

            The bills before us embrace almost every device for remedying the abuses of our
              system; but they all seem to be impracticable. There is no measure before this body in
              regard to which I have received so many earnest petitions from my people. I crave the
              indulgence of the House while I review as briefly as possible, the general features of
              our divorce laws, and the objections thereto.

            I do not insist that our present statute can not be improved, but that great care
              must be exercised in its modification, so that our condition may not be rendered
              worse, instead of better, by the change. That great abuses exist under our law of
              divorce is most true-that they are in the main, however, the fault of illogical and
              unauthorized deductions from the law, or violations of its spirit, and not of the law
              itself, I believe to be none the less a fact. In many of these cases false and
              fraudulent testimony is adduced, and our courts have generally felt compelled to
              receive this testimony as true when no attempt has been made to impeach it,
              notwithstanding a fair suspicion might well attach to the witness from the style of
              delivery or the method in which the evidence was obtained. In my opinion, the court
              should exercise a wider discretion, and subject the evidence, especially that which
              appears in the form of depositions, to a close scrutiny, positively disregarding that
              which is tainted, or has the semblance of fraud. If just grounds exist for divorce,
              there can be no difficulty improving them, under our liberal system, to the most
              perfect satisfaction of the court. 

            It is to remedy this, however, and make certain and directory, what I now regard as
              implied, that I introduce this substitute for the bills now pending before the House.
              In offering this substitute I go upon the ground that the general principle of our
              Divorce law is correct, and upon that proposition I shall base my argument.

            What are considered sufficient grounds for divorce by our statute?

            
              First-Adultery.
              Second-Impotency.
              Third-Abandonment for one year.
              Fourth-Cruel treatment.
              Fifth-Habitual Drunkenness.
              Sixth-Conviction of an infamous crime.
              Seventh-Any other cause which the court may deem sufficient.
            

            Is there one of these causes, which upon careful reflection, we would change?

            When the husband refuses to live With his wife, and continues this refusal beyond the
              time when a reasonable hope can be entertained of his return and reconciliation, just
              that the injured party should remain bound if she desires a release?

            

            A failure to provide the necessary support for his family is another cause, and who
              change this?

            The spectacle which we too often see of lazy, shifting men, idling their time away,
              while their wives, whom they have sworn to cherish and support, are reversing the
              order of things and maintaining them by their hard and illy requited labor, is such a
              palpable argument in favor of this cause that I need not enlarge upon it. The man has
              promised to love, protect support and defend his wife, and when he fails in any of
              these, he violates his contract, and the injured party should, by every rule of law
              and equity be releived from the further performance of her part of the agreement.

            You cannot compel a man to remain at home. You cannot compel him to speak kindly to
              his wife. You cannot compel him to work, and by his labor provide for his family. He
              may disregard public opinion and public decency. He may leave her to toil through life
              in loneliness and misery, but thanks to a law which, in my opinion, is wise and
              salutary, there is a remedy when forbearance ceases to be a virtue, and that is in
              severing every link which binds her to a man who has ceased to deserve the name of
              husband.

            Bishop, in his admirable work on Marriage and Divorce, defines marriage to be the
              "civil status of one woman and one man, united in law for life, under an
              obligation to discharge to each other and to community the duties which the community
              by its laws holds incumbent upon those whose association is founded on the distinction
              of sex." The definition of other writers approximate his.

            The Roman Catholics regard marriage as a sacrament, and tho' Protestants do not
              so look upon it, they still account it of divine origin and invest it with the
              sanctions of religion. I propose to examine this in a worldly point of view first;
              that it is a civil contract entered into by parties intellectually and phisically
              capable of performing its duties. Although our law books hold marriage to be a civil
              contract, yet all agree that it differs in many respects from other contacts of that
              nature, and this distinction is indicated in the definition given by Bishop. Contracts
              generally are of a nature that concern only the contracting parties, but there is an
              obligation to discharge the duties which the parties owe to community as well as
              themselves. While the contract is merely executory it does not differ materially from
              from any other, and damages may be recovered by either party for failure to comply
              with the agreement. But when the contact has so far progressed as to be merged in the
              status of marriage, the peculiar nature of the results the new duties and
              responsibilities creep in, demand a larger and wider significance than the words civil
              contract imply.

            In law, then, marriage is something more than this; if it were not so, any violation
              of agreement would be held sufficient to dissolve it. Neglect, where love had been
              promised; harsh epithets, where kind words had been contemplated; disobedience, where
              compliance with the will of the husband had been required as a condition precedent to
              the union; all these, were marriage strictly a civil contract, would be grounds for
              its dissolution, and as between the parties themselves, these would even now
              constitute an equitable ground for divorce, but just here the community step in and
              hold that nothing but the most flagrant violation of the contract in which the public
              has so much interest shall relieve the parties from the obligations they have
              assumed.

            It is admitted by all that there is no contract of such importance to the parties as
              this. It overshadows all other earthly agreements, because upon the wisdom or folly of
              the choice depends the happiness or misery of the parties. In my opinion, the fact
              that it is so sacred a thing, is the strong reason why its every requirement should
              not be violated with impunity, and why, when its priviliges have been trampled into
              the dust-by one of the parties, that it should be dissolved.

            There is one phase of this matter which is a singular one, and which vidialy
              illustrates the distinction between this and other contracts: A minor makes a con
              tract for a horse, or any other trifling piece of property, and the law, regarding him
              as under its protection, says to the vendor: You can not enforce the agreement. When
              the young man comes to maturity, if he desires, he can hold you to the contract: but
              if he wishes to annul it, he is at liberty so to do and there is no remedy, because
              the law regards him as incapable of deciding for himself as to what is best for his
              interests. But the same young man, while the hot and inconsiderate blood of youth is
              coursing through his veins, enters into a contract overshadowing in its importance all
              others which could have been made; one which no shrewdness or wisdom in after life can
              remedy. And yet the law says to him, you have chosen your course, and must abide the
              issue. I have sometimes doubted the wisdom of such a law, and sometimes have thought
              it might be well to fix a more mature age at which marriage should be valid, but, as I
              said, this illustrates the distinction between contracts of this nature and other
              civil contracts, sinking the interests of the minor in that of the community. I am
              glad to know, also, that early marriages are usually happy ones, and that there
              exists, in fact, no pressing demand for change in this respect, otherwise the justice
              of granting some remedy would appeal very strongly to us. Has the operations of our
              law worked illy to public morals? I think not. Crime is said to be on the increase ;
              but so is our population, and so are our facilities for ascertaining of crime. And
              then, even if such were the fact, and attempts were made to attribute it in a measure
              to our laws of divorce, we can readily point to other States where divorces are not
              granted save for scriptural offences, and  where
              licentiousness, in the garb of aristocracy, stalks and flaunts itself defiantly in the
              face of public opinion.

            If we are degenerating, then some other cause must be assigned.

            Every State has an interest in the private morals, public happiness, general virtue
              and legitimate increase of the community. Sound policy, therefore, demands the
              dissolution of those marriages which fail to accomplish the ends for which they were
              enacted. By this means the State obtains the fruits of new alliances and children are
              trained under better influences." I once heard a public lecturer assert that he
              could tell in five minutes conversation with children, the relations of the father and
              mother, whether happy or otherwise the influences of home showing itself plainly in
              the manner and conversation of the children. The influence for evil which unhappy
              homes exert on the early plaetic minds of children can hardly be estimated.

            "Education," says a distinguished writer, "does not commence with the
              alphabet. It begins with a mothers look-with a fathers smile of approbation or
              reproof, with a sisters gentle pressure of the hand, or a brothers nable act of
              forbearance, with thoughts directed in sweet and kindly tones and words, to nature, to
              acts of benevolence, to deeds of virtue, and to the source of all good, to God
              himself,"

            To such names, and to such easy education can we trace the noble men and women of our
              land.

            Better no home, better wander a desolate orphan at once, than to grow up amid scenes
              of dissention and strife, where every word of cruelty and reproach, and strife is sent
              into the mind to remain, and fester, and bear its noxious fruit. I have watched many
              divorces and the subsequent lives of the parties; and I do not now remember one where
              the results were not beneficial to both parents and children. Of course there are
              exceptions, perhaps many of them, but such do not now occur to me; while I remember
              many where happiness and contentment were the result.

            Much remark has been made regarding a disgraceful case which occurred recently at
              Lagrange. The peculiar hardship of that case seems to be that the wife was left
              penniless by the decree of divorce. Had the case been of a different character,
              however, the same fraud might have been perpetrated, and one of the objects of the
              bill which I present is to provide that this case may be opened up so far as regards
              the question of property and the injured wife receive substantial justice. The father
              is plainly under obligations to support his wife and children, and the same statute
              which granted him the divorce should compel him to provide for those to whom he owes
              this duty.

            If the law provided this remedy where would be the hardship in this case? Do you say
              it is cruel to separate a woman from such a man? "Why, that would be to say that
              he was worthy of her love-that he was a valuable article of furniture-a treasure which
              the good wife should cherish and not despise. When, if I read the reports correctly
              and interpret the epithets aright, he announced os a monster unworthy the so amiable a
              lady. What then has she lost except the share of property which justly belonged to her
              and which she should yet recover? Nay! rather has she not gained more than a thousand
              such estates are worth in being separated forever from this wretched semblance of a
              man.

            And now comes in an illustration of that portion of our law which permits a judge to
              decree a divorce upon any grounds which may deem sufficient.

            The position of a judge is a high one, surrounded with many difficulties, but he as
              well as other officers, is amenable to the law and must wield his prerogatives with
              care and prudence.

            He may, it is true, decree divorces without any perceptible reason, but so may he
              decide other momentous questions; and this power is one of the necessary evils which
              it is hard to remedy. It is the practice I believe to confine decress of divorce to
              the statutary grounds, and only in exceptional cases is the rule departed from. But
              this case before us furnishes an exception. Suppose this man had gone into court,
              precisely as he did go in ; had sought a divorce on the same grounds and for the same
              reasons, and had only failed through some technical defect in his papers; after this
              endeavor to rob his family and abandon his wife, would any man say she was not
              entitled to a divorce? and yet, by repealing that section which leaves this to the
              discretion of the Court, she would be wholly without a remedy, unlest she could prove
              him guilty of some of the offenses mentioned in the statute. This is one case in many
              where a repeal of that law would work hardship to the injured party.

            This consideration of the divorce law is not by any means new. Connecticut had a law
              similar to our own, and she repealed it. Divorces were then granted by the
              Legislature, and hardly a case was refused. At last the law was re-enacted, save the
              clause giving the Court discretionary power, and, finally this clause was added to the
              rest. And yet, no one reviles Connecticut for her divorce system, but, on the
              contrary, she is known all over the world as the land of steady habits.

            Many persons, if they knew that a divorce could not be obtained would behave far more
              loosely than otherwise. If they knew that no offense of theirs could separate them
              from a desirable partner, the restraint which a wholesome fear of the consequences now
              throws around them would be gone, and offenses against the marriage relation would
              vastly increase. "Honest liberty is the greatest foe to dishonest
              license."

            In England, violations of the laws of morality and promiscuous indulgences, where
              parties are married in law, but not not in fact have reached a frightful pitch.
              "Illegitmate births are of daily occurrence, polygamy is winked at, though a in
              the statute books." And there, laws punishing adultery, except as an
              ecclesiastical offense, is unknown. 

            

            South Carolina, the only State in the Union where a divorce has never been granted,
              and where adultery is not an indictable offense, found it necessary to enact a law
              regulating by statute how much property a man should give his concubine.A learned
              Judge said from the bench: "In this country, where divorces are not granted for
              any cause, whatever, we sometimes see men of excellent character unfortunate in their
              marriages, and virtuous women abandoned or driven away houseless by their husbands,
              who would be doomed to live a life celibacy and solitude if they did not form new
              connections which the law does not allow, and who make excellent husbands and virtuous
              wives still.

            "In other words, the husband and wife who not live happily together and who
              separate and form new connections, unlawful though they be, make with their new
              commons "excellent husbands and virtuous wives still." And yet the laws of
              South Carolina, permitting this State of things, winking at the commission of crime,
              prefers that the dissatisfied husbands and wives of that State should live in
              disgraceful and notorious adultery, rather than that a wholesome divorce law should
              encumber the statute of their virtuous commonwealth.

            "The reports of that State record one case where a man took his negro slave
              woman to his bed and table, and compelled the unoffending wife to receive the crumbs
              after her, and still the court refused to sever this living body from this putrid
              carcass."

            There are some who think that our law should recognize none but what they term the
              scriptural ground for divorce, and regard adultery as the only sufficient cause, while
              others seem to think that excessive cruelty is also recognized as sufficient by Divine
              minority. An examination will show how difficult it is to come to a clear conclusion
              regarding the scriptural doctrine.

            "Whosoever putteth away his wife," says the Word, "save for the cause
              of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery; and whosoever shall marry her that is
              divorced committeth adultery."

            It is plain, from other portions of the Scripture, that the Saviour did not intend to
              change the old Mosaic law upon this subject, because, in the same chapter, he says he
              did not come to destroy the law, but to fulfill it, and the old law permitted the
              husband to be the sole judge of the causes for which he he might put her away. The
              words are, he has found some "uncleanness in her," and might seem to
              indicate adultery alone; but as that offense was punished with death, and therefore
              the putting her away would work no advantage, the words must have a wider meaning.
              Again, the words used in the original and in our English version is fornication, which
              could only be committed before marriage, and consequently could not mean adultery. I
              wish I had time to enlarge upon this part of the subject, but I can only thus briefly
              refer to it.

            Of all propositions that are made, that proposing to divorce from bed and board are
              the worst. It is properly characterized by Lord Stowell as "casting out the
              parties in the dangerous characters of a wife without a husband and a husband without
              a wife;" by Judge Swift as "placing them in a situation where there is an
              irresistible temptation to the commission of adultery, unless they pessess more
              frigity or more virtue than usually falls to the lot of human beings;" and by Mr.
              Bancroft as "punishing the innocent more than the guilty." Mark the last.
              Here is a divorce decreed for adultery. The man is the guilty party. You do not
              restrain him from crime by prohibiting a remarriage, for it is not likely one who has
              forgotten the duties which he owes to his wife will observe those which he owes to
              society. He has committed the offence once and he will commit it again. The decree is
              no punishment to him who deserves the penalty, but compels the wife against whom there
              is no wrong, to live out a life of thankless solitude, the victim of a crime which met
              her heartiest condemnation.

            Such injustice would not obtain in other matters-why is this? The remedy proposed is
              a mere compromise which men who believe the marriage contract indissoluble, make with
              their consciences, and is made up of "pious doctrine and worldly
              stupidity."It is only equaled by that other absurd law, which prevails somewhat
              in England, under which suits may be brought for the "Restitution of conjugal
              rights," and whereby a man who forsakes his bed and board, as some people propose
              that he shall do by law, may be brought back and "thrust into the bliss which in
              his judgeship's opinion, he has too lightly prized."

            There are those who sneer at the love which buds and blossoms anew in a heart once
              made desolate by an unhappy marriage.

            There is a tendency indeed to look upon marriage of every kind now-a-days as a
              business transaction, where so much is paid in money or physical beauty as the price
              of the union. And so it comes that when an injured wife or an outraged husband, seek
              redress for their wrongs in a court of justice they are regarded as lascivious
              wretches, who only wish to sever the old bonds that that they may contract new
              alliances for sensual gratification.

            Mr. Speaker, I cry out against this wholesale denunciation. I think of that young
              girl who, in the warm flush of youth, has been led by false promises and mistaken
              affection to throw herself away on one who proves recreant to every vow. The bright
              visions which delighted her girlsh imagination, and flitted like a golden sunbeams
              across her future are dissolved. The great end and aim of existence is lost to her.
              The pleasing fancies which she had conjured up and treasured so dearly are dispelled,
              and the web of happiness which she had woven for herself is torn in shreds by the hand
              which should have strengthened it.

            Then the heart which was once so light and tender and loving, grows cold and
              heartless and cynical. Then the cheeks which once crimsoned at a look, grow pale and
              pinched  and relentless. Life to her is a burden,
              happiness is a lie, and weary and disconsolate she longs for rest, "anywhere,
              anywhere, out of the world."

            But suddenly a hope, like that which seizes the wrecked mariner as he sees in the dim
              speck upon the horizon a sign of relief, brightens her eye and once more quickens her
              pulse. There is a hope, and it becomes tangible and real to her when the majesty of
              the law steps, in protecting the humble and defenceless, and relieves her of the
              ponderous chains which rivit her to the earth. She is free once more, and in after
              years you may see th,at wronged woman, after passing under the chastening rod, which
              has purified and exhalted her, in a happy home surrounded by all that makes life
              desireable and looking back only with a shudder at the existence she has left
              behind.

            A happy marrriage and a home where love reigns and peace and virtue sit enthroned is
              the grand end, the consumation devoutly wished by every true woman. It has been and I
              trust mey ever be, the girlish dream of happiness; and I can imagine no greater misery
              than that which surrounds a woman who,in her trusting confidence,has irredeemably lost
              this great prize in the lottery of life. I would riot place it beyond her power to try
              once again with that keener preception which experience has given her to retrieve this
              great misfortune. But blot this beneficent remedy from the statute book and what has
              left. There is nothing, there is no hope, there is no change; there is no deeper
              despondency.

            Aye, there is one step beyond, and I believe to-day that in States where this remedy
              is denied, if the truth could be known, you would find your homes of infamy largely
              recruited from the ranks of unhappy and despairing wives. There is that remedy left
              her, and when the end comes, as it must to all such, when the garments of the grave
              are wrapped about the despised and neglected form, men will jeer and virtuous women
              will turn away their heads, while pious divines warn their flocks by this additional
              example that "the wages of sin is death."

            I trust it will be long before a law which is at emnity with such a course will be
              stricken from the statute books.

            I hope I am not one of those, sir, who look too lightly upon the sacred relation of
              husband and wife; sacred in its name, sacred in its origin, sacred in its duties,
              sacred in its confidences and associations, and sacred in these and for these alone.
              Indeed, sir, there is no holier sight to me than that of the loving and confiding
              wife, and the proud and faithful husband walking hand in hand together through the
              journey of life, suffering together, enduring together, rejoicing together as one. The
              sight brings tears of penitence to the eyes of the harlot, and crimsons the brazen
              face of the professional roue and debauchee. And, as they grow older, as the autumn of
              life approaches, and then brown locks are tinged with silver and the winter comes on
              with its crowning glory of white, typical of the purity of those faithful hearts, the
              sight ' grows even more beautiful, for we then see that time does not always lay
              his hand unkindly upon his victims, but sometimes only touches to bless them, and that
              "every wrinkle which puts on their brows, is only another notch in the quiet
              calendar of a well-spent life!" The grain is ripe and ready for the sick and
              death to them is nought but being garnered home. They've climbed the hill
              together, and together they will sleep, peace fully, quietly, lovingly at its foot. I
              never hear a Scotchman repeat those beautiful lines of Burns', with all the
              advantages the quaint old fashioned dialect, which none but a Scotchman can properly
              render, that I can not almost see good old John Andersen as he sits, smiling through
              his tears at the plain and homely but tender and loving words of his faithful
              wife."

            
              John Anderson, my Joe John, when we were
              first acquaint,
              Your locks were like the raven, your bonnie
              brow was brent;
              But now your getting auld, John, your locks are
              like the snow,
              Yet blessings on your frosty powa, John Ander-
              son my Joe.
            

            
              John Anderson, my Joe John, we clam the hill
              thegither,
              And mony a canty time, John, we had we ane
              anither; 
              Now, we maun totter down, John, but hand in 
              hand we'll go,
              And we'll sleep thegither at the foot, John Ander
              son, my Joe."
            


            Ah! John Anderson, there was no neglect no cruelty, no abandonment there. It was
              union where mutual love and confident prevailed ; a man and woman whom God had indeed
              joined together, and whom man should not and could not separate.

            I hope the House will pardon me for this digression, but the subject naturally led me
              into it. Such marriages are made in heaven, and whether they be the results of the
              first or the second love, I would do all that in me lies to multiply their number, and
              thereby bless the parties, bless their offspring, and bless the State. One word
              regarding the particular provisions of the substitute I have offered, and I am
              through. It provides against fraud in the service of process, it provides against
              hardship in the matter of property like that which has just occurred in Lagrange, and
              gives relief in that case. It provides against the disgraceful custom which now
              permits residents to gain a technical residence here for the notorious and avowed
              purpose of securing a divorce. I venture to say that there can be no valid objection
              raised to the bill, and I hope it will pass. Some members say that we have not time to
              pass this bill now, and send it to the Senate. I hope the effort will be made, but if
              it should not, I can only say that I have done what I deem to be my duty in the
              matter, and represented so far as I have been able what I understand to be the wishes
              of my constituents.

          
          

        
        

        

        
          IN SENATE.
          
             FRIDAY, May 14, 1869.
          

          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR commanded order at 9 o'clock, and directed the reading of
            the minutes of yesterday.

          Mr. JOHNSTON, of Montgomery, demanded a call of the Senate. And it being taken
            discovered but 32 Senators present and answering to their names-as follows:

          
            
              
                Messrs. Andrews, Armstrong, Beardsley, Bellamy, Bradley, Case, Caven, Church,
                  Cravens,Eliott, Fisher, Fosdick, Gray, Green, Hadley, Hamilton, Henderson, Hess,
                  Hooper, Jacquess, Johnson of Spencer, Johnson of Montgomer, Kinley, Morgan, Rice,
                  Reynolds, Robinson of Madison, Robinson of Decatur, Scott, Stein, Wolcott, and
                  Wood-32.
              
            
          

           Pending the roll call-

          Mr. BRADLEY, as the names of the resigned Senators were severally called, announced
            that their absence was due to the fact that they had resigned on yesterday, and their
            resignations had been accepted by the Governor.

          Mr. JOHNSTON, of Montgomery, stated that Mr. Denbo had received a letter from home
            which made it necessary for him to leave last night, and he had requested this to be
            said to the Senate when his name should be called.

          When the roll call was completed-

          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR announced the number present, and stated: "there is no
            quorum present."

          Mr. GRAY moved that the absentees be sent for.

          Mr. CHURCH asked if these Senators resigned the same day that this Constitutional
            Amendment was ratified.

          Mr. GRAY said we have no knowledge of their resignations except the independent
            statement of the members themselves.

          Mr. MORGAN in reply to Mr. Church said: We have no knowledge of the 15th amendment
            having been ratified and of course cannot answer his question. 

          Mr. BRADLEY raised the point of order that it is necessary to know who the absentees
            are before we send for them. 

          Mr. GRAY. You have stated who they are.

          Mr BRADLEY made his statements on this floor as the peer of every other Senator. I have
            stated it from my own personal knowledge that those Senators who I named have resigned
            their office and are not Senators nor members of the General Assembly. All others who
            absent without leave should be named and then writs can be issued for their arrest.

          Mr. CRAVENS. The Senator from Laporte [Mr. Bradley] assumes to say who are the
            absentees. The roll call shows who they are, and that is the only evidence we have. The
            Senator very properly rises and says certain Senators have resigned. That is his
            opinion, and no doubt he states what he supposes to be true. But we cannot act on his
            statement. We must act in an official capacity; and we don't know that he has a
            power of attorney to speak for them or in their behalf. In the absence of official
            evidence, we should go on in the discharge of our duty under the Constitution, and that
            is to send for absentees-those who the roll call shows to be not present.

          Mr. GREEN. We have an authorized agent to speak for these men if they have resigned,
            and that is the Governor. And when they do resign he will report it here. The Governor
            is the agent and not the Senator. We can not have it go upon record on his say so.

          Mr. BRADLEY took issue with the Senator from Tipton, and insisted that the Governor is
            not our agent-he is not the agent of this Senate. If the Senate will not take the
            statement made here, he desired that a resolution may be adopted; calling upon the
            Governor to state whether or not the Senators have resigned. 

          Mr. FISHER. Suppose they had just been elected, came in without credentials, and he
            rose and stated that they were elected, would that justify the Senate in recognizing
            them?

          Mr. BRADLEY never made such a statement. "Sufficient for the day is the evil
            thereof."

          Mr. GRAY. We have but one evidence of the condition of the Senate on any question, and
            that is the record. The record shows that these gentlemen are members still. There is
            nothing on the record to show that they have resigned, and I claim that they are members
            of this Senate, and will remain so until the record shows different. The record is the
            evidence that must govern the Senate.

          Mr. JOHNSTON of Montgomery. The law requires that these resignations shall be handed to
            the Governor and not to the Senate. The resignations have been handed to the Governor,
            and it has been so announced in the Senate. It was announced yesterday by the Senator
            from Jefferson (Mr. Cravens) that he saw 11 handed in. It is the duty of the Governor to
            make known to the Senate that these resignations have been handed in, and if he neglects
            his duty, does that make these men Senators?

          Mr. BELLAMY. If there are any members claiming seats on this floor, they had better
            appear. If there are none, we are the constitutional body, and, have the power to go on
            and do business, or we are not. I send up the following resolution and - ask that it may
            be read for information:

          Resolved, That thirty-two Senators having answered to their names,
            that being two-thirds of all Senators elected claiming seats on this floor, there is a
            quorum present to do business, and that we proceed accordingly.

          

          Mr. BELLAMY was of opinion that we are a Constitutional body, and, in order to test the
            sense of the Senate upon the subject, moved that further proceedings under the call be
            dispensed with, in order that we may hare an opportunity to consider this
            resolution.

          The yeas and nays thereon being demanded, they were ordered and taken, resulting-yeas
            24, nays 6.

          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. Proceedings under the call are dispensed with.

          Mr. BELLAMY now offered his resolution.

          Mr. HOOPER raised the point of order that it is not in order to entertain the
            resolution, as the call of the Senate, as well as the result itself, shows there is no
            quorum present.

          Shall we without cause-and now I submit it is without cause, for there is no important
            legislation that will justify as in resorting to this extraordinary measure. What bill
            is there before the Senate that requires that we should resort to anything of this kind?
            We have passed the appropriation bills, and the Constitutional Amendment has been
            legally ratified by this Senate, and that is out of the way. Now why go back upon the
            uniform practice and precedents of both branches of this Legislature ever since the
            adoption of the present Constitution and trample under foot all these precedents and
            usages adopted and recognized in our State all this time simply for the purpose of
            branching out in a new field and giving our opponents the decided advantage of this
            question. We are now within the law-within the law and the Constitution. Now I say let
            us remain there. Let us not go outside of this safe ground. You give the minority the
            advantage over us the moment you undertake to trample under foot the Constitution and
            pass laws in violation of its plain provisions. It seems to me every reason appeals to
            us, and impresses itself upon us with force that we ought not to depart from the usual
            practice and established precedents in this direction, and if we do we give the minority
            an advantage over us they can not otherwise have. The principle of safely, as far as the
            party is concerned, laying aside every other consideration, ought to admonish us to keep
            clearly within the provisions of the Constitusion. I think to legislate in direct
            opposition to the plain provisions of the Constitution we enter upon most dangerous
            ground, and give the opposition a very great advantage over us. I trust the Senate will
            reflect upon this matter. There is nothing to be gained by it.

          Mr. CHURCH. I would ask the Senator if he don't think it about time we should
            establish some sort of custom that will stop this breaking or attempting to break a
            quorum.

          Mr. HOOPER. I admit there ought to be something done in that direction.

          Mr. BELLAMY (interposing). Is not the Senator's time up?

          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. I did not take notice.

          Mr. HOOPER. I only wish to say that the policy set up by this resolution - the attempt
            to legislate in this way-will amount to nothing. The only way by which this evil can be
            prevented is to make a proper amendment to the Constitution. Your attempt by proceeding
            in violation: the Constitution to stop this matter will be like throwing chaff before
            the wind. I repeat as my last suggestion, and I hope Senators will remember it, that
            there is nothing to justify or furnish an excuse for this course proposed to be pursued.
            If there was a measure at stake in which the great interests of the people of the State
            would be involved, it might be offered as soon plea of justification, but there is not
            one. We have passed all the important measures as far as the Senate is concerned. Then I
            say, let us keep on safe ground, within the clear provisions of the Constitution, and go
            forward in the discharge of our constitutional duties.

          Mr. WOLCOTT. Mr. President. The Senator who has just taken his seat, and to whose
            discussions I listen with great respect, has not done himself justice. He has assumed
            his own opinions to be correct, and adduced no reasons to show why the views of those
            who differ with him are incorrect. As to the gravity of this action I differ with him in
            that respect, He says that this Senate has passed all the important laws; but how does
            the Senator know what important exigencies may arise before we can amend the
            Constitution? According to his statement, if we are no longer a legislative body, it
            will be two years before a measure proposing to amend our State Constitution can be
            introduced, and it will require two other years in order to have it acted upon by a
            succeeding Legislature, and two more for the vote of the people, so are liable for six
            years to come to be constantly interrupted in legislating the most important interests
            that may arise affecting the welfare of the State. The gravity of the situation demands
            action - I do not say wrong action-but we should adopt remedies if we have them the
            emergency so great.

          Now we have very respectable authority for this action. The construction which has
            prevailed in Congress in relation to the organization of both Houses of Congress  since the foundation of the government. It has ever
            been held, as was shown in a letter written by the Vice President [Hon. Schuyler Colfax]
            and printed in the Daily Journal of this city some weeks ago, that the
            body consists not of fixed numbers, but of the qualified members belonging to the two
            houses, and that such number was variable according to election, or vacancies created by
            whatever cause; and as the number varied, by usage, the quorum varied, and majorities
            varied. While I think that is a precedent entitled to the highest respect, yet it is not
            absolute authority. The provisions of our Constitution do not materially differ in
            language from the Constitution of the United States. I read from the Constitution of the
            United States: "The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators
            from each State," etc. That language is construed to mean only that the Senate of
            the United States is to be composed of so many that is the maximum number. And when
            vacancies arise, they are to be filled by those entitled to fill them,if they see fit.
            Nor is the construction of any previous Senatorial body in this State absolute authority
            for us. We are as competent as any previous Senate to decide this question. I admit that
            we have the authority against is since the State Constitution went into effect, but
            there never before has arisen a cause for critical examination of the subject; but if
            there had been, that does not preclude an adverse decision. How often a statutory
            provision, having gone before the courts, has been decided one way, and on review has
            been decided differently? Are not we as competent as any court to construe a
            constitutional provision affecting the organization of this body? Of course we are. Now,
            I maintain that when the Constitution of the State of Indiana through a constitutional
            and legal provision of law says that the Senate shall consist of fifty members, it does
            not mean arbitrarily fifty, because that same Constitution provides for existing
            vacancies and consiquently recognizes a varied number in the legislative body as
            composing that body. As these number varys then according to the language of the
            Constitution a majority will vary, and a quorum will vary. I submit in the language of
            this resolution that we are qualified and compentent (being a quorum), to transact
            business.

          Mr. GRAY. I do not intend to make a speech, because this question has been discussed
            here at length and I do not suppose anything I might say will change the minds of
            Senators. I look upon this as a grave question. I will go as far as any Senator in the
            direction of the resolution, except when it comes in conflict with my oath, and that I
            must be allowed to judge for myself. I must keep this in view that for eighteen years we
            have required twenty-six votes to pass a bill, and why? Because we consider that the
            Senate consists of fifty members. And the idea in my mind was that the Constitution
            required it, because when a bill receives twenty-six votes if every senator was in his
            seat it could not be defeated, and therefore reflects the will of a majority of the
            people of the State. I hold that the Constitution acts upon the presumption that the
            people will elect Representatives, and when it says that the Senate shall consist of
            fifty members, the presumption of the Constitution is that the people will elect fifty.
            Now, if a majority of the members present are to constitute a quorum, we must surrender
            the principle that it takes twenty-six votes to pass a bill, otherwise we might have a
            quorum to consist of less than twenty six votes, and that would be a quorum unable to do
            business. I shall consider that the Senate consists of the number of members fixed by
            law-fifty-and that the Constitution means two-thirds of that number constitutes a quorum
            to do business. Without going further into the argument, I shall vote against the
            resolution. I shall vote against it because I know that it is intended to lead to
            something else-that this Senate is to go on and enact legislation, and I can not
            consider any act or bill passed with only thirty-two members present, as legal and
            constitutional.

          Mr. STEIN. I shall favor sustaining the decision of the Chair. This is a different
            question from that presented at the organization of the Senate. I think the people have
            a right to the opportunity of being represented, and if their agent resigns they are
            without representation. If a quorum breaks, or if any resignation occurs their
            constituency have a right to a chance to be represented. I do not think we have
            authority or precedent to go on and consider ourselves a Legislature. Besides, I do not
            see any use to enter into any adventure at this late hour, when no good, and probably a
            great deal of mischief may be done by it.

          Mr. BRADLEY. Senators refer to the Constitution without reading it properly. The
            Consitution does not fix the number of Senators or Representatives. It only fixes a
            limit. It says the House shall not exceed one hundred members, and the Senate shall not
            exceed fifty members. It also provides that the number shall be fixed by law. That law,
            passed in pursuance of the prorision of the Constitution, has as much effect as the
            Constitution itself. Then the law says the number of Senators shall be fifty. The
            Constitution provides that two-thirds of each House shall constitute a quorum to do  business. It also provides that a less number than a
            quorum may do certain acts. Those acts are specifically set forth. Now what is a House?
            Some Senators argue that it is the number of Senators present. That is certainly not
            correct, because the law says what the House is. In the Senate it is fifty. The
            Constitution says that two-thirds of that number shall constitute a quorum; and by
            implication, at least, less than two-thirds shall not constitute a quorum. But Senators
            say another provision of the Constitution provides that a majority of all the members
            elected shall be requisite to pass a bill. Now they don't consider that according
            to its letter, because it may happen that only twenty-five will be elected, and no one
            will contend that a majority of that number can pass a bill. But the Constitution means
            a majority of all the Senators elected according to law shall be requisite to pass a
            bill, and the law says fifty shall be the number. Any other construction of the
            Constitution would lead us to that pointed out by the Senator from Randolph, which is
            called a reductio ad absurdum, because if
            there are only twenty-six Senators actually elected then fourteen could pass a bill;
            hence that is not the meaning of it. It means a majority of all the Senators that may be
            elected according to law. The Constitution further says that when there are vacancies
            they shall be filled by special election. Provision is made in the Constitution for
            filling these vacancies, so that the requisite number may be had to constitute a quorum
            and to enact a law. Hence I think there is no authority for action by a less number than
            two-thirds of the whole number, or for enacting a law with less than one-half of the
            majority of the whole number. Reference has been made to the action of Congress. That
            was an extreme case, and could be justified on no other ground than emergency, and that
            can not be taken in connection with the case before the Senate.

          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. The Chair sustains the point of order, that the resolution
            cannot be entertained.

          Mr. HOOPER and Mr. JOHNSTON of Montgomery, severally made ineffectual motions to
            adjourn.

          Mr. HOOPER was at a loss to know what Object Senators can have in view by remaining
            here when it is manifest we can do nothing. The President of the Senate has ruled
            uniformly, and the ruling is undoubtedly correct, that we can do no more business
            without a quorum such as the Constitution recognizes.A message from the Governor was
            announced at the door, transmitting the names of members of the Senate who have
            presented their resignations.

          Here a lengthy discussion ensued as to the propriety of receiving any message from the
            Governor while there is no quorum present; in the meantime, a call the Senate was had,
            which discovered but 32 members answering to their names.

          The message having been read for information-

          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR decided that under the circumstances- it having direct
            reference to a quorum of the Senate-it is proper to be received.

          It is as follows:

          
            
              
                
                
                  Hon. Will. Cumback, President of the
                    Senate:
                

                I have the honor to inform the Senate through you that the following named
                  members of the Senate have on this, the 13th day of May 1869 presented and
                  delivered to me their resignations as members of the Senate of the State of
                  Indiana, to-wit:

                
                  Thomas G. Lee, Senator from the counties of Shelby and Bartholomew.
                  Ochmig Bird, Senator from the counties of Allen and Adams.
                  Robert Huey, Senator from the counties of Jay, Blackford and Grant.
                  J. M. Hanna, Senator from the counties of Clay and Sullivan.
                  Charles B. Laselle Senator from the counties of Cass and Falton.
                  Elijah Huffman, Senator from the counties of Ohio and Dearborn,John M.
                    Humphreys, Senator from the counties of Green and Owen.
                  W. S. Turner, Senator from the counties of Davies and Knox.
                  William W. Carson, Senator from the county of Allen.
                  Thomas Gifford, Senator from the county of Franklin.
                  W. F. Sherrod, Senator from the counties of Orange, Crawford, and
                    Perry.
                  William Taggart, Senator from the counties of Brown and Jackson.
                  George V. Howk, Senator from the counties of Clark and Floyd.
                  William Smith, Senator from the counties of Huntington and Wells.
                  W. H. Montgomery, Senator from the counties of Pike, Dubois, and
                    Martin.
                

                You will please present this communication to the Senate.

                
                  CONRAD BAKER
                  EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,
                  
                    Indianapolis, May 13,1869.
                  
                
              
            
          

          Mr. CRAVENS now asked the privilege of introducing the resolution offered by the
            Senator from Switzerland (Mr. Bellamy.)

          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR-Senator from Switzerland offers the following resolution-Mr.
            Bellamy having corrected it so as to read:

          Resolved, That thirty-two Senators having answered to their names,
            that being two-third of all Senators elected, claiming seats on this floor-a message
            from the Governor having been read showing that sixteen Senators have resigned their
            seats-there is a quorum present to do business, and that we proceed accordingly.

          Mr. JOHNSTON, of Montgomery. It is not in order to introduce a resolution.

          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR The chair decides that the resolution is not in order.

          Mr. CRAVENS, in no spirit of disrespect, took an appeal to the Senate from  the decision of the chair having supposed what the decision
            would be from rulings heretofore.

          Mr BELLAMY signified his willingness to join in the appeal.

          Mr CRAVENS presented the following appeal:

          
            
              
                
                A call of the Senate was ordered, and thirty-two senators having answered to
                  their names, further proceedings were dispensed with. The message of the Governor
                  announcing that sixteen Senators had resigned their seats was read. The Senator
                  from Switzerland offered the following resolution, [here insert]; and the chair
                  ruled it out of order. From that ruling we respectfully appeal to the Senate.

                
                  JOHN R. CRAVENS,
                    F. J. BELLAMY.
                
              
            
          

           The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. The question is: shall the decision of the Chair stand as the
            judgment of the Senate? 

          Mr. BRADLEY moved to lay the appeal on the table.

          The motion was rejected by yeas 8, nays 24-as follows:

          
            
              
                YEAS-Messrs. Bradley, Gray, Henderson, Hooper, Jaquess,
                  Johnston of Montgomerv, Morgan and Wood-8.

                NAYS-Messrs. Andrew, Armstrong, Beardsley, Bellamy, Case,
                  Caven, Church, Cravens, Eliott, Fisher, Fosdick, Green, Hadley, Hamilton, Hoss,
                  Johnson of Spencer Kinley, Rice, Reynolds, Robinson of Madison, Robinson of
                  Decatur, Scott, Stein, and Wolcott-24.
              
            
          

          Pending the roll call-

          Mr. GRAY, when his name was called, said he did not want to accomodate the resigning
            members by divulging the fact that there is no quorum present. He voted to sustain the
            decision of the Chair "aye."

          Mr. WOOD, when his name was called, was understood to say that he was one of those who
            entertained the opinion that it takes 34 members to constitute a quorum; consequently he
            voted "aye."

          So the motion to lay the appeal on the table was rejected.

          Mr. JOHNSTON of Montgomery. There is no quorum voting.

          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. The Chair decides, as far as this question is concerned, that
            they have the right to determine whether there is a quorum or not. I leave it with the
            Senate.

          Mr. HOOPER. Mr. President: I do not desire to make any factious opposition to this
            resolution. It seems to me that we are now about to take a step we will have reason to
            regret, and I can not consent that toe vote shall be taken without entering my protest
            against it. Now, I have a clear conviction in my own mind that we can not do any
            legislative act without a quorum. Nothing that was said in the discussion of this
            question yesterday evening (in caucus) has changed my mind upon this question. The
            strong argument made in favor of the n of the fifteenth amendment, was really outside of
            our State Constitution. a matter the Constitution of the United States regulated; and it
            was placed more particularly upon that ground. But this question derives no support from
            that source, because the question of what constitutes a quorum depends entirely upon our
            State Constitution, and it does seem to me that the matter is so plain there can be no
            mistake about it. It provides that two-thirds of each House shall constitute a quorum to
            do business; and the other provisions in the Constitution all go to confirm this. It
            expressly provides that without a quorum we can do certain things, and can do nothing
            else. And what are they? Simply that we can meet and adjourn from day to day and send
            for absent members. If the other provisions left it in doubt at all so it was an open
            question, it seems to me this direct provision settles it beyond all controversy, and
            our duty is plain, definite and clear; and the only thing we can do is to adjourn from
            day to day and send for absent members. Entertaining this opinion in regard to this
            matter I must vote to sustain the position of the chair.

          Mr. ROBINSON, of Madison, thought the Senator had spoken beyond his time.

          And then came the recess till 2 o'clock. 

          
            AFTERNOON SESSION.

            Mr. RICE offered a resolution authorizing the Lieut. Governor to draw his warrant in
              favor of O. M. Wilson for the sum of $100 for the calendar of titles of bills prepared
              by him at the commencement of the present session.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR said the trouble about entertaining the resolution is that
              the record shows we have no quorum. It has been decided all the morning that we can do
              no business without a quorum; and we have got a message from the Governor, audit goes
              upon the journal, showing that we can not have a quorum. The Governor's message
              informs us that we are left with less than two-thirds of the members of this body, and
              that fact is on the journal.

            The following message was received from the House of Representatives by a Clerk
              thereof:

            
              
                
                  
                  
                     MR. PRESIDENT
                  
                   -I am directed by the House of Representatives to inform the Senate that the
                    House has concurred in the engrossed amendments of the Senate to House bill No. 311"A bill making
                    specific appropriations for the year one thousand eight hundred and
                    sixty-nine."On motion of Mr. GREENE the Senate took a recess for half an
                    hour. 
                
              
            
       
          
            When the LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR resumed the Chair-

            On motion by Mr. WOOD-

            The Senate adjourned till 9 o'clock tomorrow morning. 
          
          
          
          
        
        

        

        
          HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.

          The House met at 9 o'clock A. M.

          Mr. COFFROTH moved that there be a call of the House.

          Mr. GORDON. The first thing in order-is the reading of the Journal.

          The SPEAKER. If the Chair is satisfied that there is a quorum present, then he shall
            Order the reading of the Journal.

          Mr. COFFROTH. Then I withdraw the motion for a call-

          Mr. MONROE. Mr. Speaker-

          Mr. COFFROTH. And I move to dispense with the reading of the Journal, and demand the
            yeas and nays.

          Mr. MONROE. I move that the House adjourn.

          Mr. COFFROTH insisted that his motion should be entertained.

          The SPEAKER. The Chair understood the gentleman to withdraw his motion for a call of
            the House.

          Mr. COFFROTH. When I withdrew the motion for a call of the House then I immediately
            made a motion to dispense with the reading of the journal. I was first an the floor, and
            my motion is in order.

          The SPEAKER. With deference to the gentleman, the Chair has a different opinion.

          Mr. COFFROTH. Then, on the motion to adjourn, I demand that the vote be taken by
            tellers.

          Mr. STEWART, of Rush, submitted that a motion to adjourn is always in order, except
            when the House is under the previous question.

          The SPEAKER stated another exception when a gentleman has the floor.

          Mr. DAVIS, of Floyd, rose to a question of privilege-an error in these reports this
            morning touching a motion made yesterday to table the resolution of the gentleman from
            Jennings [Mr. Overmyer}. I did not move with the gentleman from Marshal [Mr. Johnson],
            to lay that resolution on the table; but when the gentleman from Marshall moved to lay a
            portion of the resolution on the table, I remarked, that if a part of it went to the
            table, of course, it would all go together. I was in favor of the resolution.

          Mr. COFFROTH also rose to a correction of these reports. In the House proceedings
            printed in this morning's JOURNAL he read:

          Mr. RATLIFF, explaining his negative vote, said, We need a few more members to pass a
            Specific Appropriation bill which we have been talking about for a month or two; and
            preferring to wait for a quorum for that purpose, he voted "no."

          "Mr. COFFROTH, in his seat. There is no member absent for any such
            purpose."

          This makes nonsense; unless it were stated, that Mr. Coffroth understood the gentleman
            from Grant to say that Democratic members had withdrawn for the purpose of defeating the
            specific bill. He now again demanded the vote on the motion for adjournment of the House
            to be taken by tellers.

          The SPEAKER. The Chair knows of no rule which authorizes a demand for tellers There may
            be a demand for the yeas and nays.

          Mr. COFFROTH. I will show the rule.

          Mr. OSBORN. There can be no necessity for tellers; unless there are objections to the
            motion.

          Mr. COFFROTH. I am objecting to adjourning.

          Mr. PIERCE of Porter. I also am objecting to an adjournment; and I hope the House will
            reject the motion.

          Mr. STANTON. I believe I will join the gentleman in demanding the yeas and nays. I hope
            the House will not adjourn. If we are going to do anything, let us do it now.

          The SPEAKER repressed debate.

          Mr. COFFROTH now read from Rule 5 of the Standing Rules of the House of Representatives
            as pertinent to his demand for tellers, the following:

          "If the Speaker doubts, or a division be called for, the House shall divide; those
            in the affirmative shall first rise from their seats, and remain standing until they are
            counted, and afterwards those in the negative in like manner. If the Speaker still
            doubts, or a count be required, the Speaker shall name two members, one for each side,
            to tell those in the affirmative and negative; and the result being reported, he shall
            rise up and report the decision to the House."

          Mr. MONROE now withdrew his motion to adjourn.

          Mr. DUNN moved that there be a call of the House.

          Mr. COFFROTH seconded the motion, and demanded the yeas and nays on the question.

          The yeas and nays were ordered, being taken, resulted-yeas 20, nays 30-as follows:

          
            
              
                YEAS.-Messrs. Chittenden, Coffroth, Davidson, Davis of Floyd,
                  Dunn, Fairchild, Field of Lake, Gilham, Hall, Hutson, Michell, Monroe, Pierce of
                  Porter, Ruddell, Stanton, Stephenson, Stewart of Rush, Vardeman, Wildman and
                  Williams of Union-20.

                NAYS.-Messrs. Baker, Barnett, Beatty, Beelier, Bowen,
                  Bfeckinridge, Chapman, Davis of Elkhart, Field of Lagrange, Furnas, Gordon,
                  Greene, Higbee, Higgins, Johnson of Parke. Johnson of Marshall, Jump, Kercheval,
                  Lamborn, Mason, Millekan, Miller, Osborn, Overmyer, Pierce of Vigo, Ratliff,
                  Sabin, Skidmore, Smith, Taber, Underwood, Vater, Williams of Hamilton, and Mr.
                  Speaker-30.
              
            
          

          So the motion for a call of the was rejected.

          Mr. OSBORN moved that the House now adjourn; which was agreed to.

          So the House took a recess till 2 o'clock. 

          

          
            AFTERNOON SESSION.

             The SPEAKER resumed at 2 o'clock p. M. 
          

          
            THE SPECIFIC APPROPRIATION BILL.

            Mr. OSBORN. Mr. Speaker: I move that the House concur in the Senate's amendments
              to the Specific Appropriation bill [H. R.
              311].

            The motion was agreed to, and the Senate amendments were concurred in by unanimous
              consent.

            Mr. OSBORN then moved to reconsider this vote, and to lay the motion to reconsider on
              the table.

            The latter motion was agreed to. 
          
          

          
            THE FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT.

            A message from the Senate now announced that that body had passed a joint resolution
                [S. 18] accepting and ratifying a certain
              amendment to the Constitution of the United States, in which the concurrence of the
              House is respectfully requested.

            Mr. OSBORN. Mr. Speaker.

            The SPEAKER. The gentleman from Putnam will give way for the Chair to lay before the
              House a message from the Governor.A message from the Governor, dated May 14, 1869, was
              read by the Clerk, announcing the resignation of certain members of the House of
              Representatives.

            Mr. OSBORN. I move that the House take up the consideration of the Senate joint resolution No. 18, ratifying and
              accepting a certain amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and thereupon
              I move the previous question.

            Mr. COFFROTH demanded a call of the House. He then submitted the point of order, that
              the consideration of this amendment having been fixed by resolution for hall-past two
              to-day, the motion of the gentleman from Putnam amounts to a proposition to amend the
              rules, and can not be now considered.

            Mr. OSBORN. There has been no action of the House yet on the constitutional
              amendment. I insist that the yeas and nays can not be called after my demand for the
              previous question.

            The SPEAKER. The Chair will hold the motion of the gentleman from Putnam is in order,
              and also that the demand for a call of the House is in order.

            The call proceeded, and the record discovered 56 members present-Mr, Johnston, of
              Park, insisting that the names of the resigned members on the roll be not called, and
              the Speaker making the order accordingly.

            Mr. COFFROTH, speaking to a privileged question, affirmed that by his watch, which
              was set this morning, it yet wanted five minutes of two o'clock.

            Mr. OSBORN said his watch was with the House clock.

            The SPEAKER said: I have my time fifteen minutes after two o'clock.

            Mr. COFFROTH presumed that all the watches in the House had been advanced to suit
              that time. He now submitted his point of order, that there is no quorum present.
              According to all precedent, the Constitution and laws of the State, two-thirds of the
              members elected to either branch of the General Assembly are required to make a
              quorum; and no legislative'act can be done without a quorum. Therefore, inasmuch
              as the call of the House has developed only fifty-six members present-eleven members
              less than a quorum - of sixty-seven-the House can not do any legislative act; can not
              consider and act authoritatively and legally on this question.

            The SPEAKER. In reply to the gentleman; the Chair has repeatedly decided that for the
              purposes of legislation it requires sixty-seven members to constitute a quorum for
              legislative business of any ordinary character-that being the number required by the
              Constitution of the State. But on the question presented here to-day, there is a great
              diversity of opinion. The Chair, of course, entertains its own views. But there is
              sufficient doubt in regard to this matter-which is, indeed, as I conceive, a matter of
              very great importance to warrant the Chair in holding that on the question of
              ratifying an amendment to the Constitution of the United States-in the absence of any
              precedent in the legislation, or in the Constitution of our State, in the absence of
              any law of Congress as to what shall constitute a quorum for the purpose of ratifying
              a Constitutional Amendment-the question never can be decided and settled unless it is
              decided in this way. It is a question which the Courts will have to decide. Then,
              notwithstanding the Chair entertains its own peculiar notions of the matter, it will
              decide and hold, that the motion to take up the joint resolution from the Senate is in
              order.

            Mr. COFFROTH. I appeal from the decision of the Chair.

            Mr. OSBORN submitted, that an appeal from the decision of the Chair is not in order
              pending a demand for the previous question.

            The SPEAKER. The Chair thinks the demand for the previous question would not cut off
              the right of an appeal. But it will have to be decided without debate. The gentlemen
              will send it up.

            Mr. OSBORN. I move to lay the appeal of the gentleman from Huntington on the
              table.

            Mr. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker. I call for the special order.

            Mr. DAVIS, of Floyd. What's the matter with the gentleman over there?
              [Laughter.]

            

            Mr. COFFROTH now submitted his appeal in writing, which he himself read from the
              Clerk's desk.

            
              
                
                  
                  On Friday afternoon, May the 14th, A. D. 1869, a call of the House
                    having been ordered and taken, and having shown that only fifty-six (56) members
                    were present, and no motion made to send for absentees, and a communication from
                    the Governor having been presented and read, showing that on the 13th day of
                    said May, forty-two members of the House had resigned, thereupon the gentleman
                    from Putnam and Hendricks (Mr. Osborn) moved to proceed to the consideration of
                      Senate joint resolution No. eighteen
                      (18), which is a joint resolution to ratify the proposed Fifteenth
                    Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, whereupon, the gentleman
                    from Huntington (Mr. Coffroth) raised the point of order that it was not
                    competent for the House to proceed to the consideration of said joint
                    resolution, because there was no quorum present; and that for the same reason it
                    was not in order to transact any legislative business. But the chair overruled
                    the said point of order, and decided that the House could proceed to the
                    consideration of said joint resolution.

                  Now from said decision, we, the undersigned, do appeal.

                  J. R. COFFROTH,
                    Representative from Huntington. JOHN S. DAVIS,
                    Representative from Floyd.
                
              
            

            Mr. COFFROTH demanded the yeas and nays on the motion to lay the appeal on the table,
              and the vote resulted-yeas, 54; nays, 3.

            
              
                
                  YEAS-Messrs. Baker, Barnett, Beatty, Beeler, Bowen,
                    Breckinridge, Chapman, Chittenden, Davidson, Davis of Elkhart, Dunn, Fairchild,
                    Field of Lake, Field of Lagrange, Furnas, Gilham, Gordon, Greene, Hall,
                    Hamilton, Higbee, Higgins, Hutson, Johnson of Parke, Johnson of Marshall, Jump,
                    Kercheval, Lamborn, Mason, Millekan, Miller, Monroe, Osborn, Overmyer, Pierce of
                    Porter, Pierce of Vigo, Ratliff, Ruddell, Sabin, Skidmore, Smith, Stanton,
                    Stephenson, Stewart of Ohio, Stewart of Rush, Taber, Underwood, Vardeman, Vater,
                    Wildman, Williams of Hamilton, Williams of Union, Willson, and Mr.
                    Speaker.-54.

                  NAYS.-Messrs. Coffroth, Davis of Floyd, and Mitchell.-3.
                
              
            

            So the appeal was laid on the table, and the question recurred on seconding the
              demand for the previous question. The previous question was seconded, and the main
              question ordered, viz: Shall the joint resolution for ratification of the fifteenth
              amendment proposed by Congress to the Constitution of the United States pass?-the vote
              resulting-yeas 54, nays 0-as follows:

            
              
                
                   YEAS-Messrs. Baker, Barnett, Beatty, Beeler, Bowen,
                    Breckinridge, Chapman, Chittenden, Davis of Elkhart, Davidson, Dunn, Fairchild,
                    Field of Lake, Field of LaGrange, Furnas, Gilham, Gordon, Greeen, all, Hamilton,
                    Higbee, Higgins. Hutson, Johnson of Parke, Johnson of Marshall, Jump, Kercheval,
                    Lamborn, Mason, Millekan, Miller, Monroe, Osborn, Oyermyer, Pierce of Porter,
                    Pierce of Vigo, Ratliff, Ruddell. Sabin, Skidmore, Smith, Stanton, Stephenson,
                    Stewart of Ohio, Stewart of Rush, Taber, Underwood, Vardeman, Vater, Wildman.
                    Williams of Hamilton, Williams of Union, Wilson, Mr. Speaker - 54.
                
              
            

            Mr. COFFROTH, when his name was called, rose to the privilege of explanation, and
              said: When I became a member of this House, I took an oath to support the Constitution
              of the United States and of the State of Indiana; and the Constitution the State of
              Indiana requires and prescribes that sixty-seven members here shall constitute a
              quorum to do business; and because the call of the House has determined that there are
              fifty-six members present-eleven less than a quorum of sixty-seven members-and as I
              regard this proceeding in violation of the State institution, I decline to vote.

            VOICES. "Consent""consent."

            Mr. DAVIS, of Floyd, when his name was called, rose to the same privilege and said.
              Mr. Speaker: This resolution is proposed as a ratification on the part of th? State of
              Indiana of a certain amendment of the Constitution of the United States. The
              Constitution of the United States, Mr. Speaker, was framed by our fathers, and we have
              lived and prospered under it many long years. It is now proposed to amend it by a mode
              unknown to the Constitution-not by the voice of the people, but in defiance of the
              wishes of the people of the State-in defiance of the Constitution under which we live,
              and in defiance of the the rules of this House. We are here sir, without a
              quorum-without the authority or right to do any legislative act; yet it is proposed to
              go through the farce of pretending to ratify this amendment to the Constitution of the
              United States which changes the organic law

            Mr. OSBORN, interposing. Have you not just recognized this as a House, by appealing
              from the decision of the Speaker?

            Mr. DAVIS. I insist, Mr. Speaker, that certain things may be done here, although a
              quorum may not be present; but to a legislative act, there must be a quorum of the
              body. But it does seem to me that the effect of your action, sir, upon this resolution
              is to bring the institutions and the Constitution of the country into disrepute.
              [Cries of "Order."] I do not make any imputation against any man in a
              personal sense; I simply address the Chair as the presiding officer of the body; but I
              do say that the inevitable effect of this action will be to bring the institutions of
              our country into disrepute. 

            Mr. KERCHEVAL, interposing. I submit, that the gentleman can not, under a question of
              privilege, discuss the merits of the question before the House. 

            The SPEAKER. It is not for the Chair to determine the course which the gentleman will
              take. The gentleman understand the parliamentary restrictions as well as the Chair,
              and it is to be supposed that will not exceed them. 

            Mr. DAVIS. Then I ask to be excuse from voting, because I believe that we have no
              right to vote on this question. 

            

            Mr. DUNN, when his name was called, said: Like the gentleman from Floyd, I have sworn
              to support the Constitution of the State and the United States. Every Democratic
              member here took the same oath. When I took that oath, I swore I would support the
              Constitution, and act upon every bill or resolution that might come here in a
              Constitutional way. And I am here to-day acting pursuance of that sworn duty. But
              there are those Democrats who resigned, whose names are registered arid given in favor
              of the same obligation? I am here because the Constitution keeps me here the same
              instrument binds them, and yet there are they? I vote now, sir,
              upon this joint question, because I believe that I have a legal, Constitutional right
              to do so, and even did I think otherwise I would hold myself justified by the maxim,
                inter anna leges silent-"In rebellion
              laws are silent." I vote "aye."

            Mr. GORDON explaining, said: I came here, sir, as a representative. My views are
              somewhat different from many others; but I will freely confess that my legal knowledge
              is not of that character which should enable me to decide this question in disregard
              of the views of more distinguished men. I have thought, and I think to-day, that the
              ratification of this amendment by this House at this time, would not be legal. Yet our
              greatest legal minds have said that it would be; and for one, I am willing to defer to
              the opinions of others more learned in the legal profession, especially in this case,
              because I feel that I am acting in a manner that will not only do justice to myself
              and my constituents, but justice to to mankind. In casting my vote to-day on this
              question, if I have doubts in reference to the legality of the act, I wish to say to
              the House that in my voice and my vote, my doubt shall be given in favor of
              humanity.

            Mr. COFFROTH interposed. When did the scales fall from your eyes? 

            Mr. GORDON. They have not fallen perhaps; but if they have they fell "our years
              ago in battle with rebels. [Applause.] When I stood those years in that contest with
              the enemies of my country - I had occasion to find out who did not use to maintain
              this Government; and I shall vote not to refuse the right of suffrage to any man who,
              when called upon, took up arms in defense of his country-who took up arms for their
              country to put down the traitors banded to destroy it in the hour of trial.

            Mr. MITCHELL, rising and asking to be excused from voting, said: Mr. Speaker, this is
              a grave and important question, and one upon which there has been no discussion by
              this assembly. Sir, it is a proposition which, when ratified by three-fourths of the
              States in this Union, will universally determine the destiny of this Republic, either
              for weal or for woe. Sir, we have had no interchange of opinions with regard to it,
              and it is for this reason alone that I claim the right to explain my position at this
              time. Sir, the great people of our government, the sovereigns of her power, without
              regard to party, have but recently unanimously declared that the right to control the
              question of suffrage belongs to each State for herself. By that I understand that if
              every State in this Union saving Indiana alone should vote to confer suffrage upon a
              class or race of people who are now deprived of that right, it would still be for
              Indiana to say whether she would do likewise. Should she refuse, what then would be
              the consequence? The answer to this question is to be found in the 14th amendment to
              the Constitution of the United States, viz.: Indiana would not be entitled to
              representation in Congress for the number of people from whom she has withheld the
              right to vote. Read that 14th amendment, and you will not, no, you can not fail to
              discover the fact that the people of this Government are driven to consult the
              platforms of the various political parties before they can ascertain what their rights
              are in this regard. For when the Constitution itself declares that if any State shall
              refuse to any portion of her citizens the right to vote, she shall not be allowed
              representation in Congress for that number, it says to every State in this Union, you
              may or you may not grant the franchise just as you like. But, sir, we are told that
              this is a proposition to amend the Constitution, and by that means rid ourselves of
              any further trouble upon this point. Sir, in answer to that I would say that it is an
              ingenious evasion of the point. Amend the constitution! Why, sir, do you propose to
              say to the people of Indiana that they shall no longer control the question of
              suffrage? If you do, and that is your argument, I publish the fact to the world. I
              repeat that the Constitution has declared the right in favor of a State. And our
              people are imbued with a spirit of its just appreciation. Sir, they are daily heaping
              their curses upon the heads of our Senators and Representatives in Congress who
              pledged to the principle, have violated their obligations to their sovereigns, and
              destroyed the faith and confidence of an honest and unsuspecting constituency by
              aiding in the destruction of the very principle they had sworn to protect. Sir, we are
              called upon to-day to vote for or against this proposition. I have sworn to support
              the Constitution of this State; that Constitution declares that we can do no business
              without a quorum. Then, Mr. Speaker, I will not acknowledge the right of this body  to act upon this question by giving my vote,
              neither for or against the resolution. I will not make perjury the last act of my
              connection with the Forty-sixth General Assembly of Indiana. Sir, I refuse to
              vote.

            VOICES-"Consent," "Consent."

            Mr. PIERCE, of Porter, explained his rote, and said: Mr. Speaker: I dislike to
              explain my vote, but the imputation cast upon those voting for this proposition by the
              gentleman from Morgan (Mr. Mitchell) seems to demand a brief review of this subject.
              Charges of perjury should not be lightly made, and it seems to me that the remarks of
              the gentlemen are wholly uncalled for and gratuitous. I have never had any doubt, sir,
              as to our legal right to pass this resolution, and to perform any other legislative
              act while a majority of the members were present. This is the only safe ground to
              occupy; it is the only interpretation of our Constitution which is in harmony with
              sound reason and common sense. To say that a minority of the General Assembly can
              resign and thereby defeat the will of the people as expressed through their
              representatives, is so dangerous a heresy, a doctrine so thoroughly fraught with
              disaster to the State, that I wonder the proposition should be entertained for a
              moment. Why, sir, if that is true, what have we left? What assurance have we that the
              precedent established here this winter will not become the ruling passion, and
              frequent and repeated resignations of one or the other political parties, upon
              measures which they may deem obnoxious, prevent any important legislation of the
              State? If that doctrine is entertained, I submit that our institutions are a mockery,
              our republicanism a farce, our State Government is nothing but a huge skeleton of
              anarchy, draped in the fig leaves of democracy. But, sir, I have taken some pains to
              examine this matter in the light which established precedents throw upon it, and am
              free to say that the more I have studied it the stronger has been my convictions
              regarding the legality of our present course.

            As some of these precedents are Democratic, let me refer to those first for the
              benefit of my friend from Huntington (Mr. Coffroth.)

            The oft-quoted section of the State Constitution reads:

            "Two-thirds of each House shall constitute a quorum to do
              business, but a smaller number may meet, adjourn from day to day and compel the
              attendance of absent members."

            Now, what is the House ? Is it the full number elected? If that
              is true, then the whole legislation of the State is illegal, because there is seldom,
              if ever, one hundred members present. Can there be a House,
              then, with less than the full number? And if so, what composes the House and Senate.
              Let us see? The National Constitution in its provisions regarding vetoed bills and
              amendments, is similar to that of this State - 

            Article 1, section 7, in regard to the veto power, says:

            "If, after such reconsideration, two-thirds of that House shall agree to pass
              the bill, it shall be sent, together with the objections, to the other House, by which
              it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two-thirds of that House, it
              shall become a law."

            Article 5 of the Constitution, relative to Constitutional Amendments, reads:

            "The Congress, whenever two-thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall
              propose amendments to the Constitution, etc."

            In the 36th Congress, thirty-three States were represented at the opening of its
              first sessions, with sixty-six Senators. During the winter of 1860-61, a number of
              Senators and Representatives abandoned their seats; and on the 2d of March, 1861, a
              the question being on the passage of the Joint Resolution, submitting what was known
              as the Corwin Constitutional Amendments to the Senate, the vote was ayes 24, nays 12,
              exactly a two-thirds vote of the Senators present, but not a two-thirds vote of the
              Senators present, but not a two-thirds vote of those entitled to seats, even after
              deducting those who had resigned.

            The President pro tem (Mr. Polk, of
              Missouri), declared that the joint resolution had passed. Mr. Trumbull appealed, in
              order to have the question appealed, in order to have the question settled; and on
              sustaining the decision of the Chair, the vote was as follows:

            
              
                
                  YEAS - Messrs. Anthony of Rhode Island, Bakes or Oregon,
                    Bigler of Pennsylvania, Bingham of Michigan, Clark of New Hampshire, Crittenden
                    of Kentucky, Dixon of Connecticut, Doolittle of Wisconsin, Douglas of Illinois,
                    Durkee ofWis-consin, Fessenden of Maine, toot of Vermont, Foster of Connecticut,
                    Grimes of Iowa, Gwin of California, Harlan of Iowa, Hunter of Virginia, Andrew
                    Johnson of Tennessee,Kennedy of Maryland, Latham of California, Mason of
                    Virginia, Nicholson of Tennessee, Pugh of Ohio, Rice of Minnesota, Sebastian of
                    Arkansas, Sumner of Massachusetts, Ten Eyck of New Jersey, Thomson of New
                    Jersey, Trumbull of Illinois, Wilkinson of Minnesota, and Wilson of
                    Massachusetts-33.

                  NAYS-Mr. Wade of Ohio-1.

                
              
            

            So the Senate decided, almost unanimously, that two-thirds of those present were
              constitutionally two-thirds of the Senate.

            In the debate on the appeal, Mr. Pugh sustained the decision of the Chair, and
              referred to many decisions in the early Journals of the Senate, which I have not time
              to read, and finally alluded to the action of the Senate July 7, 1856, overruling the
              veto on the Mississippi River bill, by ayes, 31; noes 12, where Mr. Bright, President
                pro tem, decided that the bill had again
              passed, notwithstanding the President's veto, and an appeal was taken from the
              decision, the ruling of Mr. Bright was sustained and the
              principle reaffirmed that two-thirds of the members present were
              two-thirds of the Senate.

            It will be observed that this precise princible was involved there, as the National
              Constitution requires two-thirds of each House to pass a bill over the veto of the
              President, precisely as our State Constitution requires two-thirds to form a quorum.
                 This is Democratic precedent, too, as Mr.
              Bright was in the chair, and made the decision, while such men as Benjamin and
              Slidell, of Louisiana; Cass, of Michigan, and Douglas, of Illinois, warmly sustained
              the decision. [See Globe, 1st session 34th Congress, page
              1,550.]

            Mr. COFFROTH (interrupting). O! well! Bright was a secessionist.

            Mr. PIERCE. Then this should certainly be the best authority for the gentleman from
              Huntington. [Laughter.] Some may try to confuse the mind and make a distinction
              without a difference between the cases I have cited and our own, by saying that in all
              these a quorum, (which was a majority,) was present, while in our own the Constituion
              demands that there shall be two-thirds. Without replying, as I might very readily to
              this, by pointing to the fact that where two-thirds is demanded by the Federal
              Constitution, (that is, in the passage of vetoed bills and submission of amendments,)
              only those present were counted; without doing this, I say, I will put this beyond
              dispute by referring to cases where legislation has been accomplished by less than a
              majority of the members elected, the number required by the Constitution to form a
              quorum. I read again the following extracts from the Senate Journal. On January 4th,
              1790, there being then twelve States, and twelve Senators present, that number was
              held to be a quorum, though all the members had been elected by the States, because as
              the Journal reads, "it is supposed that the seat of one of
              the Senators of Virginia, Mr. Grayson, had been vacated by death" - a significant
              exception.

            In the House of Representatives, the Constitution had fixed sixty-five
              Representatives as the number which the thirteen States should be "entitled to choose!" But, at the opening of the First Congress, only
              eleven States had ratified the Constitution, and they were "entitled" to
              fifty-nine Representatives. When thirty appeared, the Journal declares that "a
              quorum was present. At the second session of the Seventh Congress there were sixteen
              States, entitled to one hundred and forty members. On the 'th of December, 1802,
              sixty-seven appeared, which the Journal explicitly declared to be a quorum, as
              follows: "being a majority of the whole number of qualified members."

            In the Tenth Congress, December 7, 1808, when membership was still one hundred and
              forty, a majority of which would be, on a call of the House fifty-nine members having
              voted, it was declared to be a quorum.

            I might multiply these precedents, but I must not impose upon the patience of the
              House. There is one more, however, to which I wish to refer, it being such excellent
              Democratic authority, and I expect, after reading this, that my friends from Floyd and
              Huntington will vote for the Constitutional Amendment:

            On the 19th of July, 1861, Speaker Grow decided, there having been but 183
              Representatives chosen to that Congress, 92 was a majority of all chosen, and the
              majority of a quorum would be 47, whereupon the following colloquy occurred. [See Congressional Globe, Thirty-seventh Congress, page 210]:

            Mr. VALLANDIGHAM. I concur in that decision. Then the Chair decides that the previous
              question is seconded.

            The SPEAKER. The Chair so decides.

            Mr. VALLANDIGHAM. I think the House consists only of the members sworn in.

            The SPEAKER. The Chair has held in this case that those chosen constitute the House,
              as they have been returned to the Clerk.

            Mr. VALLANDIGHAM. The Chair has no knowledge of any member unless he appears here.
              The question may become material by-and-by, and I save the point.

            Mr. Vallandingham went much beyond us; he did not wait for them to resign, but
                "had no knowledge of any member unless he appeared in the
                House;" and he said the question might become important and he saved the
              point. The question has become important to us, and I am glad
              the point was "saved" for our information. Indeed, the only serious
              objection in the Senate to this course was made by Garret Davis of Kentucky, and he
              only insisted that substantial efforts should first be made to secure a majority of
              the whole number before declaring less than that a quorum. Then, Mr. Speaker,
              believing that I have the precedents established by the highest legislative authority
              in the land, as well as the plainest rules of reason and common sense to support me,
              what hesitation should I have in casting my vote here to-day? I have none. The vexed
              question of negro suffrage is about to be settled for all time. We have had strife,
              confusion, turmoil and bitterness enough. The question whether the negro should be
              enfranchised has been a vexed and annoying one. They have been the threatening cloud
              which has hung over this nation for years. Let us dispel the cloud by voting for this
              just provision, and thereby set in the political heavens the rainbow of peace to us
              and of promise to them. I vote "aye!"

            Mr. STEWART, of Rush, explaining, said: Mr. Speaker, I have no difficulty in voting
              on the point before the House-as to the manner in which it is to be done I see no
              difficulty. Somewhere in my reading I remember what is said of an ancient law-giver
              giving a code of laws to the people. He gave his code, and, in the course of it being
              operated upon, there came up a question in a case where a father killed  his own son. And the case came for trial before the
              law-giver in order to be adjusted, and the law-giver said, when he had considered it,
              that it was a case so unnatural that he had made no provision in his code for such a
              case. Now, sir, I consider that we are in a similar condition. The resignation of
              these forty-two members of the House presents a case so unnatural that it has not been
              provided for in precedent-it presents a case so unexpected that it has not been
              provided for in our legislation. Therefore I consider that when these cases do occur
              they discover great principles that are wanting in the Constitution, and leave us to
              meet the question of revolution with revolution-to assume that it is Constitutional to
              do what is right. I vote "aye."'

            Mr. UNDERWOOD explaining, said he had taken an oath with others to support the
              Constitution, and recognized the obligation. The Constitution prescribes that
              two-thirds of the House shall constitute a quorum. We have just received official
              notice of resignations that reduce the number of members in the House to 59.
              Two-thirds of that number are 40, and with this understanding we have a quorum in the
              House. I vote "aye."

            Whereupon, the SPEAKER announced the result and declared the joint resolution adopted
              by the House of Representatives.

            And then, on the motion of Mr. JOHNSTON, ofParke-

            The House adjourned. 
          
          
          
          
        
        

        
          IN SENATE.
          
             SATURDAY, May 15, 1869.
          

          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR commanded order at 9 o'clock, A. M.,
            and thereupon-

          Mr. ROBINSON, of Madison, moved that we adjourn until Monday morning at 9
            o'clock.

          Mr. JOHNSTON, of Montgomery, said he rose to a question of privilege.

          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. State your question of privilege.

          Mr. JOHNSTON, of Montgomery, said he wished to send up a written protest against the
            action of the Senate in pretending to ratify the Fifteenth Amendment, and he desired to
            have it put upon the journals.

          The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR said: That is not a privileged question.

          And then the motion to adjourn was agreed to. 

        
        

        
           HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
          
             SATURDAY, May 15, 1869.
          

           The SPEAKER called the House to order at 9 o'clock A. M., and
            subsequently, on invitation, Mr. Davis of Floyd, Chair. 

          
            ADJOURNMENT TILL MONDAY

            Mr. RUDDELL. Mr. Speaker-I move that the House adjourn.

            Mr. COFFROTH. Would it not be better to say, when the House adjourns it shall be till
              Monday morning, 9 o'clock? Otherwise we would have to be here at 2 o'clock
              to-day. 

            Mr. RUDDELL. My motion is made. Let him amend it.

            Mr. COFFROTH. I move, then, to amend the motion, so as to make it: That when the
              House adjourns to-day, it shall be till Monday morning, 9 o'clock.

            Mr. GORDON. I rise to a point of order. Nothing can be in order till the journal is
              read.

            The SPEAKER. There is not a quorum. The journal is not read till the Chair is
              satisfied that there is a quorum.

            Mr. RUDDELL accepted Mr. Coffroth's amendment, and so his motion was agreed to
              by consent. 
          
          

          
            SPEAKER BUSKIRK

            Mr. COFFROTH. I wish to say to the House that I am compelled to go home today, and I
              take it for granted that the House will give me leave of absence
              (''Consent," "consent"). I have a resolution to offer. I have
              thought it proper, and it is perhaps but just, that the resolution which I propose to
              submit, should come from the minority, and I propose to introduce it now, not as a
              mere matter of form, but because I think it is due under all the circumstances. I
              offer the following resolution:

            Mr. GORDON. I object to the reading.

            The SPEAKER pro tempore. The resolution
              will be read for information. And the Clerk read as follows:

            
              
                
                  Resolved, That the warmest thanks and most kindly wishes of
                    this House are hereby presented to the honorable George A. Buskirk, for the
                    able, faithful, and impartial manner in which he has discharged his duties as
                    Speaker.
                
              
            

            The resolution was entertained and adopted by unanimous consent. 
          
          

          
            H. H. ROBINSON.

            Mr. PIERCE, of Porter, submitted the following, which was also adopted by
              consent.

            
              
                
                  Resolved, That H. H. Robinson, Reading Clerk of the House, be
                    allowed per diem for the session. 
                
              
            

          
          

          
            COMMITTEE REPORTS.

            Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I have some reports here from the Judiciary
                Committee, recommending indefinite postponement of certain bills.

            The SPEAKER pro tempore. Reports are not in
              order. 
          
          

          

          
            LEAVE OF ABSENCE.

            COFFROTH. Mr. Speaker, I am really compelled to go away to-day on important business,
              and I would like to have leave of absence. ("Consent, consent.")

            The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is taken by
              consent. The gentleman can go. 
          
          

          
            WILLIAMS OF ST. JOSEPH.

            Mr. OSBORN. I wish to inquire if the gentleman from St. Joseph (Mr. Williams) has

            The SPEAKER pro tempore. That is out of
              order. The gentleman from Boone will pardon the Chair for the expression of a
              different opinion as to that fact. [Laughter.]

            Mr. GORDON continued. I insist that the colored folks may have the right to
              re-ratify. [Laughter.]

            Mr. JOHNSTON, of Parke. Mr. Speaker, I am requested to ask leave of absence for Mr.
              Miller ("consent.")

            The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has
              leave.

            Mr. WILDMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask for leave of absence for the balance of the
              session.

            VOICES. "Consent," "consent."

            The SPEAKER pro tempore. You can go,

            THE MORGAN RAID BILL.

            Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I move to re consider the vote by which the House postponed
              the consideration of the Morgan raid bill.

            The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is
              re-considered. [Cheers.]

            The SPEAKER pro tempore The amendments are
              concurred in. [Cheers and laughter.]

            Mr. STANTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise to point of order.

                    mder them, for the able and faithful manner in which they have discharged their

            After an ineffectual motion to adjourn, by invitation of the presiding incumbent, Mr.
              Ruddell occupied the Chair. 
          
          

          
            A NEW BILL.

            Mr. DAVIS, of Floyd. Mr. Speaker, I offer, and I desire to introduce the following
              bill.

            The SPEAKER pro tempore. Bills are out of
              order.

            Mr. STANTON. I appeal from the decision of the Chair.

            The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair is all
              right. 
          
          

          
            SUFFRAGE AMENDMENT.

            Mr. DAVIS, of Floyd. Mr. Speaker, I more to reconsider the vote of yesterday for
              ratifying the negro suffrage.

            Mr. BUSKIRK. I second the motion, and move a call of the House. [Laughter.]

            Mr. DAVIS. I withdraw the motion. 
          
          

          
            VALEDICTORY.

            Mr. COFFROTH. Mr. Speaker, being about to leave the hall, I want to say a word to
              members, one and all, with the kindest feeling; and it is this: That if any word of
              seeming unpleasantness has been at any time uttered here in debate, either on my part
              or that of any other member I know that I, at least, am of a nature that is a little
              hasty, and if I have at any time said anything that ought not to have been said; if a
              single word has been spoken in the heat and earnestness of debate, that has stirred
              the feeling of anger in any breast, I hope it will not be cherished by any one. I hope
              we shall all meet again. Probably we never will. I know, indeed, that we never shall
              all meet again in a legislative capacity; and I wish to part with all in the best
              feeling here. And I hope that you may all live long, and come happily to the solace
              and rewards of life, that you may all live to a peaceful good old age: that your eyes
              may

            
              "Grow dim in death as sets 
              The morning star, which goes not down behind 
              The darkling west and sinks obscure 
              Amid the tempest sky, but melts away 
              Into the light of heaven."
            

             I bid you good morning. 

            

            Mr. BUSKIRK. I move that the House do now adjourn.

            The motion was agreed to; and accordingly, the House adjourned till Monday morning,
              nine o'clock. 
          
          

        
        

        
          IN SENATE.
          
            MONDAY, May 17. 1869.
          

          The PRESIDENT pro tem., [Hon. Isaac P. Gray]
            took the Chair at 9 o'clock A. M., and thereupon-

          Mr. JOHNSTON, on Montgomery. Mr. President.

          Mr. GREEN. Mr. President.

          The PRESIDENT pro tem. The Senator from
            Tipton.Mr. GREEN. I move that the Senate adjourn sine
              die.

          Mr. JOHNSTON, of Montgomery. I hope that motion will not be put now.

          Mr. BRADLEY. I insist upon it that the Senator from Montgomery addressed the Chair
            first. My hearing is pretty sharp.

          Mr. GREEN. I insist upon my motion. Put the question.

          The PRESIDENT pro tem. The Chair will have to
            put the motion unless the Senator from Tipton withdraws it.

          Mr. BRADLEY. I really hope the Senator will withdraw his motion.

          Mr. GREEN. I know pretty near the thing you have got there, and it is not true if it is
            what is printed in the Sentinel. I demand the question.

          Mr. BRADLEY. Will the Senator say, inside or outside of this chamber, that the facts
            there stated are not true?

          Mr. GREEN. Yes, sir; I will state it in the House or out of the House.

          Mr. ROBINSON, of Madison. So will I.

          Mr. BRADLEY. Will the Senator say they are not true?

          Mr. GREEN. Yes sir; because it says there were only thirty-two Senators answered, when
            thirty-four were here.

          Mr. BRADLEY. I will see the Senator outside of the chamber.

          Mr. JOHNSTON, of Montgomery. We certainly have some rights here, and if we are not to
            have them accorded us, it is the fault -.

          The PRESIDENT pro tem. The opinion of the
            Chair is well known; that you have a perfect right to enter a protest upon the journals,
            but I can not receive it now, for I recognized his [the Senator from Tipton's]
            motion.

          Mr. JOHNSTON, of Montgomery. It is couched in respectful language, and we ask that it
            be read and put upon the journals, if it is in proper language.

          The PRESIDENT pro tem. Unless the Senator
            from Tipton withdraws his-I will have to put it.

          Mr. JOHNSTON, of Montgomery. Then that Senator has the power to control the Chair.

          The PRESIDENT pro tem. I heard his motion
            first, and recognized him. Mr. BRADLEY. I rise to a point of order. No person seconded
            the motion.

          Mr. ROBINSON, of Madison. I seconded the motion.

          The PRESIDENT pro tem. Those in favor of the
            motion, say "aye;" contrary, "no." The Senate stands adjourned
              sine die.

          Mr. BRADLEY. Some persons voted who are not Senators.

          The PRESIDENT pro tem. Do you call for a
            division?

          Mr. BRADLEY. Yes, sir.

          The PRESIDENT pro tem. As many favor the
            motion to adjourn will rise.

          Mr. BRADLEY and Mr. JOHNSTON,Of Montgomery. "Yeas and nays," yeas and
            nays."

          Mr. FISHER. I rise to a point of order The Chair has already decided the Senate
            adjourned sine die.

          The PRESIDENT pro tem. Six were voting in the
            affirmative, and two in the negative. The Senate adjourned sine die.

          The protest which Mr. Johnston, of Montgomery, desired to offer is as follows;

            But before pronouncing the adjournment, I feel it to be my duty, as well as my
              pleasure, to return to each of you, so far as words will express, my heartfelt thanks
              for the uniformly kind and courteous treatment that you have extended to me as your
              presiding officer. Your kindness and partiality shall never be forgotten, and when age
              shall have dimmed' the eyes and silvered the locks, I will recur to the time
              spent hero this session as among the most pleasant and agreeable recollections of my
              life.

            By a unanimous vote the thanks of the House have been tendered to William A. Merwin,
              Principal Clerk, John O. Hardesty, Assistant Clerk, T. C. McConn, Doorkeeper, and
              their employes; and I would be remiss in duty if I did not add this testimony to the
              fidelity and promptness that has characterized their conduct from the beginning to the
              close of the session in the discharge of their important duties, and for the numerous
              acts of personal kindness shown me; and my kindest regards shall follow them through
              life. 

            

             I here wish to say, that, if at any time in the discharge of the perplexing duties
              of the Chair, or in the more exciting contests incident to debate, I have have given
              offense, I take this occasion to humbly ask forgiveness, and that the act be not
              imputed to any intentional disregard of the rights or feelings of others, but the
              result of a momentary weakness to which we are all subject.

            The circumstances under which we were brought together caused the most prudent and
              thoughtful to entertain the belief that universal partisan bitterness would be
              displayed during the session, and that our proceedings would be noted for their
              disorderly character; but to our own credit and to the credit of the State, by mutual
              forbearance of those differing politically, the state of affairs anticipated was
              averted; and, probably, never in the history of the legislation of the State has more
              general good feeling existed and uniform courtesy been displayed among members than
              during this session.

            I have neither the time nor inclination to enter into a discussion of the merits of
              the laws enacted. This subject more properly belongs to our constituents, and,
              doubtless, they will do so, and hold us to a strict accountability, which, in my
              judgment, is the true check upon improper legislation. For, while the position of a
              member of this House is in no way desirable, there are few of us that care to forfeit
              the good opinion of those we represent.

            Many laws of an important character failed to pass for want of time, while others of
              doubtful expediency have been enacted; but I indulge the hope that most of those that
              have received our sanction will tend to promote the general welfare.

            It is to me a source of congratulation that you are soon to realize the bright
              anticipations, indulged so freely throughout the session, of once more resuming the
              endearing relations of home. To those of you who are blessed with a loving wife and
              affectionate children, this must be the consummation of true happiness; and the wonder
              is, that intelligent gentlemen can be induced, even for the short period that we have
              spent at the Capital, to abandon such a relation for the thankless and unprofitable
              business which called us together. In conclusion, permit me to indulge the hope that
              health and properity may follow you to the close of a long and useful life.

            I now pronounce this House adjourned, sine
                die.

            So the House adjourned.

            THE SPECIAL SESSION OF 1869  OF THE FORTY-SIXTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF
            THESTATE OF INDIANA. 
          
            ORGANIZATION OF THE SENATE....DEBATE  IN CONTINUATION.
            IN SENATE.
            
               SATURDAY, April 8, 1869.
            

            [IN CONTINUATION-p. 21.]

            Mr. SCOTT, of Vigo, had introduced the following resolution:

            Resolved, That the Governor be notified that no Senator from any district where
              special elections have been ordered, has appeared to qualify as a member of this body
              on a call of the districts.

            Objection was made to the resolution by Senator Bradley, of Laporte, as being out of
              order. Some discussion was had over the point of order, but it was finally sustained
              by the Lieutenant-Governor on the ground that the Senate being without a quorum it
              could transact no business, except to adjourn or send for absent members ; and it was
              admitted that withholding members, who had never qualified, were not such
              "absent" members as could be sent for. After this ruling had been made a
              desultory discussion in regard to its propriety was carried on, in the course of which
              Senator Stein obtained the floor, and made the following remarks in reference not only
              to the ruling, but upon the more important question of that constitutes a quorum in
              case of a withholding of a portion of members at the primary organization of the
              Senate:

            Mr. STEIN. Mr. President: There seems to be no regular question before the Senate;
              but, as members decline to adjourn,' talk ' may be considered the order of
              the afternoon; and this a good time for the expression of opinions generally.
              Admitting the assumption of the President, that we lack a quorum, the decision just
              made was, I think, right. As a body less than a quorum, I think what appears in the
              Constitution is the only grant of power we have. But I cannot assent to the admission,
              that we are so helpless-that we are really without a quorum. This may seem a wild
              fancy to some, but it will bear investigation, I and I am in great error, if it will
              not ultimately be found grounded in truth. I would have preferred broaching the
              proposition at a later I day, and regret that the motion to adjourn did ; not prevail.
              The reason assigned by the President for his ruling on the resolution of the Senator
              from Vigo, to wit: That we lack a quorum, compels me, however, to enter my protest at
              this point. My notion is, that our programme of proceedings should have been, after
              calling the roll and finding the vacant districts unresponded to, to consider
              ourselves the Constitutional Senate of Indiana ; and adjourn to to-morrow out of
              courtesy to those  who may have been elected in
              those districts, to give them a further opportunity of presenting themselves before
              the Senate. We have no official knowledge of what ails the members representing these
              districts. They may possibly be absent on account of sickness, or they may fail to
              arrive in consequence of the interruptions of travel. And it might be proper to give
              them another day. And inasmuch as the constitution talks about five days'
              manipulation before an organization, I feel disposed to-

            Mr. CHURCH, (interrupting.) From information just received, I learn that they have
              been mired in the Black Swamps. [Laughter.]

            Mr. STEIN. All the more reason why we should give them another day.

            Mr. BRADLEY (to Mr. Church.) Who gave you that information?

            Mr. CHURCH. I believe the rules of the House do not require me to answer.
              [Laughter.]

            Mr. STEIN. Wherever the information came from, it is quite probable. This is a miry
              season. After having exhausted five days, as I was about to observe, these defaulting
              districts being called day by day, and remaining steadfastly aloof, we could then,
              before proceeding to organization and business, consider the great question, whether a
              factious minority shall stop legislation, throttle the State Government, and possibly
              reduce the State to a condition of anarchy; or whether there is some virtue in the
              Constitution so that we can proceed to business. As far as I am concerned, my
              convictions are firm, though I do not find a superabundance of members agreeing with
              me. Upon every principle of reason and common sense, the great standard by which we
              measure public law-for the narrow technicalties which sometimes prevail in muncipal
              law, fall back and disappear when it comes to a construction of what is known as
              public law-upon every principal of reason and common sense, and, I may add, of legal
              construction, we who remain behind are the constitutional General Assembly of the
              State of Indiana. And we have full authority, from and after the time we see fit to
              assert it, to proceed with the legislation of the State. My own opinion is, that we
              have the power to consider these rebellious districts, as seceded districts, and that
              we can consider ourselves as the remains of legislation-legal legislation, left living
              in the State-and proceed with our business. And, were my judgment to prevail in this
              matter, this body would simply adjourn to-day; and after having done all that can be
              done-the qualified members having been called, and the vacant districts called-and
              tomorrow going through the same ceremony this process to be repeated five days, as a
              matter of courtesy, not as a matter of right, to these districts we should then close
              the door of grace, assert ourselves the law-making power of the State, and proceed to
              general legislation.

            The correctness of my position depends upon the construction of the constitution of
              the State of Indiana, and it is purely a question construction. The constitution is
              not specific upon this particular point, and not being specific recourse must be had
              to the principle, construction and interpretation. It says "Two-thirds of each
              House shall constitute quorum to do business." Is there anything specific about
              that? What is meant by "two thirds?" You must resort to construction and
              interpretation to ascertain the meaning, because it is dubious and uncertain. There is
              ambiguity about it, and you are therefor forced into constructions. And when you come
              to constructions, which will you adopt? That which declares a suicidal principle or
              that which declares a life-giving principle a preserving principle? In a court of
              justice this matter would not be permitted to be argued before any respectable judge
              for one minute Where have we ever heard of a court permit ting the law to be so
              construed as to pronounce its own destruction? This charter was made to exist, and not
              to be smothered throttled disemboweled. The laws are made for perpetuity, until
              repealed, and no construction will be allowed which would authorize the court to to
              decide that the constitution contains within itself a self-destroying principle. If,
              however, you construe this ambiguous passage to mean that two-thirds shall be
              two-thirds of one hundred in the other end of the Capitol, and two-thirds of fifty
              here, you put the entire government of Indiana in the hands of a factious minority,
              the government pipes out, and thus for want of breath there is no life in it. You at
              once impregnate this constitution with a self-destroying principle. It is in the hands
              of this gentleman, and this, (pointing to Mr, Bradley and Mr. Henderson) with a few of
              their comrades, to bring anarchy upon us. Now, I say that species of construction is
              violative of reason, and reason is the polar star to which we have recourse in the
              construction of public law.

            In other parts of this constitution there are different passages. There is section
              twenty-five, relating to the passage of bills: "A majority of all the members
              elected to each house shall be necessary to pass every bill or joint resolution."
              How different the language in section twenty -five from section eleven. The
              construction I put upon section eleven is this: When it speaks of two-thirds it means
              two-thirds of the members elected and qualified in each House, and that preserves the
              House. & section twenty-five I am not at liberty to say that. I will concede
              (although not required by the case) that we must have twenty-six  Senators and fifty-one members of the House to pass a bill
              or joint resolution. We are limited by the expression in section twenty-five. We can
              not, by construction, get out of that, unjust as I think it is; but being in the
              constitution, I propose to abide by it. I desire to give life to this constutution and
              not to kill it. As far as section twenty-five prescribes the number to pass a bill, I
              accept it, and am bound by it. As regards section eleven I can not construe it the way
              these gentlemen desire without enggrafting a suicidal principle in this constitution,
              and that I cannot do, because all principles of legal construction forbid it. As I
              said before, it is a question of construction entirely- The language of section eleven
              being uncertain, the only way in which you can construe that in order to give life to
              the constitution and the government, and put a veto on every posibility of dissolution
              through faction, accession or rebellion, is to construe that section in connection
              with section twenty-five, and to mean "two -thirds of the members elected and
              qualified in each House shall constitute a quorum, provided they equal the majority of
              all elected." When we have come to that, let those withholding districts stay
              away. Perhaps it will be better for the State. And, after exhausting the principles of
              courtesy, we will proceed, as the constitutional General Assembly of Indiana, having a
              full quorum to do the legislative business of the State.

            Mr. GRAY. Mr. President: I regret as much as any one the condition in which this
              Legislature finds itself, but I shall resort to no extraordinary means to accomplish
              anything not warranted by the Constitution. Now, I do not know as I clearly understand
              the Senator from Tippecanoe [Mr. Stein.] He seems to have argued a while upon one side
              of the question, and at the close of his speech upon the other side. I first
              understood him to hold clearly that we had a right to do business, and then that
              two-thirds of the qualified members could transact business. Now, I think there can be
              no doubt about what constitutes the Legislature of Indiana at all. I understand the
              Constitution of Indiana to limit the number of members"that the House shall not
              exceed 100 members, nor the Senate 50 members."

            Mr. CHURCH interposing. Suppose the counties or districts which have, by the
              apportionment, one-third of the number, refuse to elect, or refuse to be represented
              here, must the business of the State stop there?

            Mr. GRAY. Well, sir, I will answer the Senator. I propose to be governed by the
              organic act of the State, and I suppose the Senator from Porter [Mr. Church] proposes
              to do the same. And if he will show me any constitutional remedy by which we can
              escape that difficulty, I will be as ready to follow it as he. Now let him point it
              out. There are some things we can do, and some things we can not do. Among the latter,
              we can not legally legislate under the Constitution when we have no quorum.

            Mr. ROBINSON, of Madison. At the commencement of the rebellion, suppose one-third of
              the counties in Indiana had seceded with their members, and left this body reduced
              below a quorum, should that overturn the Constitution?

            Mr. GRAY. If the existence of the State of Indiana depended upon this Legislature
              doing certain business, I would be ready to do it. I believe as Daniel Webster said,
              that anything necessary to preserve the Constitution of the United States is in itself
              constitutional. But I do not think that crises has arisen yet. I do not look upon this
              as being very much of a revolution. I think these refractory members will get tired of
              that business; and then get through; and we can stand it pretty near as long as they
              can. I believe the ruling of the chair was entirely correct; because, if, I understand
              the resolution, it had no reference to compelling the attendance of absent
              members.

            Mr. SCOTT (interposing.) That is the gentleman's construction of it.

            Mr. GRAY. I think my construction is the correct one, and that the reading of the
              resolution will bear me out in it. It was to notify the Governer that these men who
              have been elected do not qualify. I say they are not absent members as long as they
              have not been sworn into office. If the resolution refers to the Senator from Parke,
              and one or two others who are absent and who did not resign, then the resolution is in
              order; but if it refers to-

            Mr. BELLAMY (interrupting.) If there are no absent members is not this House
              competent to do business?

            Mr. GRAY. No sir, [laughter] because I say your apportionment law has established the
              number of members which shall constitute this Legislature. Now I will ask the Senator
              from Switzerland [Mr. Bellamy] if he considers that these absent gentleman are
              members? He is a lawyer-I want him to say whether they are members or not.

            Mr. BELLAMY. I do not know of any members being absent, except the two or three
              named.

            Mr. GRAY. The resolution of the Senateor from Vigo [Mr. Scott] did not refer to that
              at all. I say you have no evidence before this body that anybody has been elected to
              seats here.

            Mr. SCOTT (interposing.) That is what I wanted to find out.

            Mr. GRAY. I say the Governor is no part of the Legislative branch of this government,
              and has no power to compel the attendance-

            

            Mr. FISHER (interrupting.) The object of that resolution is this: In the first place,
              it is well known to this body that the Governor has ordered elections in these
              districts. That has been published to the world. But now We come in and find that
              there has been nobody elected in these districts; and we wish to notify him of that
              fact.

            Mr. GRAY. I will ask the Senator if he knows anything more about that than the
              Governor does? What evidence have you that the Governor has not all the knowledge
              about this question that you possess? I want to know what you know more than he knows
              about these men?

            Mr. FISHER. I don't know anything about it; but I know they are not here to
              respond; and I want to notify the Governor of that we do know that they are not
              here.

            Mr. GRAY. Then the Senator wants to notify the Governor of something he knows nothing
              about, or which the Governor knows as much about as he does. [Laughter.] 
          
          
          

          
            ORGANIZATION OF THE SENATE.
            DEFERRED DEBATE.
            IN SENATE, SATURDAY, APRIL 10, 1869.
            [CONTINUED FROM PAGE 32.]

            Mr. Kinley-The only strange thing to me is that we hesitate a moment in our course.
              We are either a Senate or not a Senate. It is true the Constitution provides that the
              Senate shall not exceed fifty members, and our law provides that the State shall be
              divided into fifty Senatorial districts; and it also provides that the State shall be
              divided into one hundred districts for representative purposes. It says, in effect,
              that there shall be one hundred members in the House of Representatives. If that is to
              be construed literally, then ninety-nine members could not be a House. A single member
              resigning would destroy the House, if the law is to be construed literally. The
              Constitution provides that a majority of the members elected can enact a law or pass a
              joint resolution. If these gentlemen who stand outside the bar are not members, then
              they are not members elected and the thirty or so members that are here are the
              Senate, and we can transact any business we choose.

            The Lieutenant Governor-If the Senator will allow me, the Constitution also provides
              that it shall take two-thirds of each House to constitute a quorum to do business. And
              with less than that number, only certain acts can be done. On that ground the chair
              has based its decisions.

            Mr. Kinley-But what is a Senate? The members elected here-the thirty or so; and we
              are therefore able to transact business. It is true that we have no official notice of
              the fact-that these gentlemen standing outside the bar are members elect. But it is
              notorious that they have been elected and are refusing to qualify. And that is
              precisely one of the modes by which a seat can be made vacant. If you, as Lieutenant
              Governor, had come up here and refused to qualify, that act would vacate your seat,
              and authorize this Senate to appoint a Lieutenant Governor in your place. If the
              Governor had refused to qualify, it would have virtually vacated his office. And if a
              County Treasurer refuse to qualify, it would vacate his office. And so the offices of
              every one of these gentlemen are virtually vacated. And it is certainly within the
              power of the Senate not to send for them, as they have already ceased to be members,
              or, rather never have been members. There are so many vacancies, and it should be so
              construed.

            Mr. Cravens-Would it be competent for this body to declare these seats vacant, when
              we have no official knowledge ofth.e fact that there have been elections? The
              resolution before the Senate proposes to fortify us in that particular-to bring out
              the information.

            Mr. Kinley-I believe it is a principle  of law,
              that the statute may be plead in evidence. It is law.

            Mr. Cravens-Suppose, without information, we should send for these men, and find the
              men whom we supposed elected were not members. What will our condition then be?

            Mr. Kinley-Our condition would be simply that of arresting the wrong men.

            Mr. Bradley-I will ask the Senator it we have the power to send for any person until
              he becomes a member?

            Mr. Kinley-That is precisely the point I made; that they are not members. The very
              fact that they stay around this Hall and refuse to qualify, in my opinion, makes them
              cease to be members.

            Mr. Church-I desire to ask the Senator from Laporte, whether these persons have been
              privileged from arrest for a certain number of days, by reason of their having been
              elected?

            Mr. Bradley-That is a hard question. I do not know that any of them have been
              arrested.

            Mr. Church-Presuming that they have, what would the Senator say.

            Mr. Bradley-I do not know anything about it.

            Mr. Church-Then they are enjoying privileges by reason of their election, and
              refusing to perform the duties they owe to the State.

            Mr. Kinley-There is certainly a time when these gentlemen cease to be members.

            Mr. Bradley-They will cease to be members whenever we get a sufficient number of
              members to do business, and declare their seats vacant.

            Mr. Kinley-How many members are sufficient.

            Mr. Bradley-Thirty-four.

            Mr. Kinley-How do you make that out?

            Mr. Bradley-By the Constitution of the State.

            Mr. Kinley-What article?

            Mr. Bradley-Section eleven of article four.

            Mr. Kinley-I assure you, Mr. President, there is not one word in the Constitution
              about it. [Laughter.] The Constitution says the Senate shall not exceed fifty
              members.

            Mr. Bradley-It also says, that the number may be fixed by law. The law fixes the
              number at fifty; and thirty-four are two-thirds of fifty.

            Mr. Kinley-The law says, that the State shall be divided into fifty Senatorial
              districts. That is what it says. The Senate consists, as a matter of course, of the
              members elected and qualified. If you allow legislation to be dropped in this way, it
              is not a mob but a revolution in the State of Indiana. You would established the
              principle, that a few men, by resigning their places in the Senate, shall defeat all
              legislation. They can stand here till doomsday, and we have no Senate-no House. It is
              an outrage alike in violation of common law, common sense, common duty and decency, if
              the Senate will allow expression. I hold that we shall duty.

            Mr. Hamilton, in his seat-Amen [Laughter.]Mr. Gray I have no objection to the passage
              of this resolution at all. But I can not, for my life, see what good it would
              accomplish. You pass this resolution enquiring of the Secretary Of State whether the
              proclamation of the Governor has been complied with; and suppose you get the
              information that there have been men elected then what do you propose to do? Is there
              an office in this Government that you can compel a man to discharge the duties of
              before he has been qualified? Can you punish any man for refusal to discharge the
              duties of an office, either civil or military, into which he has not been sworn or
              qualified? I agree with the Senator from Whitley I think our course is plain and
              simple I would wait, as suggested the other day the five days. Not that we are under
              obligations to do so, but as a matter of courtesy, because the Constitution gives the
              General Assembly five days to organize; and because there might be some other
              difficulties besides the one which exists at present. After the five days have
              expired, I hold that it is within the province of the Senate to make a declaration of
              the existing facts and certify to the Governor that these seats are vacant. And I know
              whereof I speak when I say that when this thing is done, the Governor will issue writs
              for new elections. And I say further, that when these elections are held somebody will
              be qualified in this Senate and take their seats, and we will have an organization.
              Now, sir, upon this question of a quorum I may be in error, but I am honest about it.
              And, inasmuch as there has been a good deal said in regard to this question, I simply
              want to ask the Senator from Wayne, purely for the purpose of information, if I
              understood him to assume the position (as I also understood the Senator from
              Tippecanoe the other day), that two-thirds of the qualified members constitute a
              quorum? Am I correct?

            Mr. Kinley, in his seat-Yes sir.

            Mr. Gray-I can not, I could not, as a Senator, conscientiously discharge my duties in
              that way.

            Mr. Stein-My position is clearly defined. It was this: That two thirds of the members
              elected and qualified to each House constitute a quorum, provide they are equal to a
              majority of all the members elected. Since the Constitution requires a majority to
              assist in the passage of the bill, we necessarily have got to construe section 11 with
              section 25. The former section is qualified by the latter-We are now a Legislature,
              and my opinion is, that we have full power to go with legislative business.

            Mr. Gray-Then I understand the position of the Senator to be, that if there are  not twenty-six Senators qualified, there could be no
              quorum. 

            Mr. Stein-That is my private opinion.

            Mr Gray-But I want to know your public opinion. 

            Mr. Stein-My private opinion is now publicly expressed. I am not blind to the fact
              that in these vacant districts the elections have been had. A representative is at
              liberty to take information from public notoriety. I am at liberty to do that, and I
              know that elections have been had and hence I concede that to-day we must have
              twenty-six to make a working body.

            Mr. Gray - Then I understand you to hold that there could be no quorum unless there
              are twenty-six qualified members.

            Mr. Stein-If I could take official notice the fact that there had been no election, I
              would say that we could go on without these districts. It is the privilege of a
              District not to send a representative if it so chooses. The Constitution does not talk
              about qualified members.

            Mr. Gray-But suppose there were twenty-five qualified members and no more?

            Mr. Stein-That would depend upon the other question.

            Mr. Gray-If a quorum is two-thirds of the qualified members, there is such a thing as
              having a quorum in this Senate and that quorum unable to do business. Did anybody ever
              hear of any such a thing as that? I say a quorum has the power to do any business that
              comes within its province. If the Senator assumes that two-thirds of the qualified
              members constitute a quorum, and that quorum has authority to do business without
              regard to that other section of the Constitution requiring twenty-six members to pass
              a bill or joint resolution, then his position is inconsistent. If two-thirds of the
              qualified members can constitute a quorum, then two-thirds of twenty or ten can
              constitute a quorum.

            Mr. Hooper-I do not desire to detain the Senate, and shall not but a moment. If I
              understand the position of matters now, the President would rule that the resolution
              is out of order.

            The Lieutenant Governor-As far as the resolution before the Senate now is concerned,
              the Chair will state that on the first day of the session, when the Senator from Vigo
              [Mr. Scott] offered a resolution, I said that any resolution might be passed in the
              opinion of the Chair, that looked towards enforcement of our rights under the
              Constitution; that is, the right to compel the attendance of absent members. The Chair
              thought the resolution offered by the Senator from Vigo was not that sort of a
              resolution. The air is of the same opinion as to the resolution offered by the Senator
              from Tipton [Mr. Green.] The resolution now under consideration proposes to obtain
              information for the purpose of bringing about the result desired, to-wit: the
              organization of the Senate. The Chair is unable to see that the passage of the
              resolution would accomplish the result claimed, but the Chair will not undertake to
              prejudge. The effect that the passage of this resolution would have in the attainment
              of the constitutional end in view, and as it claims on its face to be for that
              purpose, the Chair, with a desire to enforce the Constitutional rule empowering the
              body to compel the attendance of absent members, will entertain the resolution.
              Admitting that there is doubts as to its propriety, the Senate being fully competent
              to determine whether it will accomplish the end it seeks, the Chair will hold the
              resolution in order, and leave the responsibility with the Senate.

            Mr. Hooper-I simply desire to call the attention of the Senate to one fact, which it
              seems to me has been somewhat overlooked. However, it does seem to me, that the
              constitution, where it prescribes that two-thirds of each House are necessary to do
              business, it manifestly has reference to legislative business. It can not in the
              nature of things, without absolutely prohibiting under certain circumstances the
              organization of the Legislature, contemplate these preliminary proceedings that are
              essential to the organization. Suppose two sets of members come up from different
              districts-and that is not an unusual thing at the commencement and before the
              organization of a legislative body;who decides these questions at that time?
              Notwithstanding you may have a provision in the constitution that two-thirds are
              necessary to do business, here is some business that necessarily has to be passed
              upon. Now, who determines this question? Why, the majority of members about whose
              credentials-there is no question. That has been the practice and usage ever since
              there has been an organization of legislative bodies. A majority of the members, then,
              determine these questions, without reference to the fact whether the constitution
              requires two-thirds of the whole number of members or not. That, I take it, is
              precisely our position to-day, and we have a clear right, in my judgment, to determine
              these preliminary questions. But when we come to transact legislative business,I
              believe the requirements of the constitution should be complied with. I differ with
              the Senator from Tippecanoe, [Mr. Stein] for whose opinion I have great respect. I can
              not bring myself to believe that we can go on with legislative business with less than
              the number required by the Constitution. The view I take to-day is, that vacancies
              exist in all these Districts from which members have failed to take their seats. And
              while the passage of this resolution may, in the opinion of Senators, be necessary to
              enable us to determine the question whether vacancies exist or not, I hold that it is
              patent before us. And we must not forget that, in determining this question, we are
              the exclusive judges; that there is no power beyond us to settle these  things. It is for us to determine to-day, whether
              vacancies exist; and our determination is final in this question. I undertake to say
              that the evidence is before us that authorizes us to determine this matter. We have
              the right to take official notice of the fact that elections have been held, and it is
              notorious that these seats are vacant, and equally notorious that these gentlemen are
              refusing to qualify. It is not necessary to read the authorities I read a moment ago,
              but I will call attention to one other.

            Vacancies may occur, before the meeting of the Assembly, by members chosen thereto
              declining to accept the office; after the meeting by their declining to take the oaths
              or complying with the other conditions, if any, requisite te entitle them to sit and
                vote.-Lex. Partiam. Am. p. 191.

            Now, that is precisely the situation today. These members are required to take the
              oath of office. They are refusing to do that; and are refusing to come in. We all
              know-it is manifest-that they are in the city. They are here hanging about the lobbies
              and the streets. Now, what is our duty?

            Mr. Cravens-I ask the Senator whether we would be justifiable in declaring vacancies,
              until we ourselves have discharged our duty in trying to compel the attendance of
              absent members? It is notorious that there have been elections, and it is notorious
              that the men elected are here.

            Mr. Hooper-I think, clearly, we would. There are no absent members that we can send
              for, because, by their acts, the3r have vacated their seats, and are no longer members
              of this body. Shall we set ourselves up as higher authority than this, which has been
              the practice and usage, acted upon and recognized as law for centuries. All we can do
              is to declare vacancies.-It is clear and manifest that these vacancies exist. And it
              is the plain duty of the presiding officers of either House to certify that fact to
              the Governor. I apprehend, as the Senator from Randolph (Mr. Gray,) said, that the
              action of the Governor can be easily judged of; that he would re-issue writs of
              election in each of the districts. And that is precisely what ought to be done, in my
              judgment. As expressing my views on this question, I will ask that the following
              resolution be read, as part of my remarks:

            The Secretary read as follows-

            
              
                
                  Resolved, That the President of the Senate notify the
                    Governor that a vacancy has happened in the office of State Senator at the
                    present session in each of the following Senatorial districts;

                  
                    The county of Vanderburgh.
                    The counties of Knox and Daviess,
                    The counties of Pike, Dubois and Martin.
                    The counties of Perry, Orange and Crawford.
                    The counties of Washington and Harrison.
                    The counties of Floyd and Clark.
                    The counties of Ohio and Dearborn.
                    The county of Franklin,The counties of Shelby and Bartholomew.
                    The counties of Green and Owen
                    The counties of Clay and Sullivan.
                    The county of Montgomery.
                    The counties of Cass and Fulton.
                    The counties of Grant, Blackford and Jay.
                    The counties of Huntington and Wells
                    The county of Allen.
                    The counties of Allen and Adams,
                  

                  by the members elect from said districts refusing to qualify and take their
                    seats at the present session of the General Assembly.

                
              
            

            Mr. Hooper-That is expressive of views upon this question. (He then read from the
              general statute which requires the presiding officer in such cases to give such notice
              to the Governor, without giving the reference.)

            Mr. Cravens-The Senator proposes declare these seats vacant. I would ask him if we
              should not have our own skirts clear before making such a declaration. In the first
              place, we have no information concerning them. I do not know but they are restrained
              of their liberty. In my judgment, and with due deference I think they are. [Laughter.]
              And it might be necessary for us to interpose the authority of this body to have them
              released. [Laughter continued.]

            Mr. Robinson, of Madison-I understand that Thomas A. Hendricks and Joseph E. McDonald
              are restraining them of their liberty. [Laughter renewed.]

            Mr. Hooper-I think that a kind of restraint not necessary for us to take cognizance
              of.

            I admit that it is a question for each one of us, on our individual responsibility,
              to determine whether vacancies exist. Other Senators may differ with me, but as far as
              I am concerned, to my mind, under my obligation, I undertake to say that the evidence
              is before me of the fact) that they refuse to come in and quality! I see them in the
              Halls of this House, in this city. I meet them in the street. I know that they are
              here, and that they are refusing to come in and qualify. And I have authority to
              sustain me in saying, that, by refusing to qualify, they "have created vacancies
              in every one of these districts. Therefore the evidence is before me, by which I am
              authorized to declare, that vacancies exist in every one of these districts.

            Perhaps here I ought to close my remarks. However, one remark by the Senator form
              Laporte, [Mr. Bradley], in reply to my first speech, does seem to demand a passing
              reply. He talks something about revolution-that this proceeding would be
              revolutionary, what we are attempting to do. Nothing in my judgment, would be further
              from it. I abhor anything of that sort as much as the Senator from Laporte can. For
              that very reason, I would not resort to anything of doubtful expediency. I can not
              therefore,enter into any arrangement to organize this body, without the necessary
              number of qualified members. I would not the State into the sea of litigation, would
              necessarily follow.

            Mr. Bradley-Is the act of declaring vacancies a legislative act.

            Mr. Hooper-It is not a legislative act  at this
              time. It is not a legislative act-I will answer squarely. It is a question that comes
              up at the organization, and for the purpose of prefecting the organization of the
              legislative body.

            Mr. Bradley - If it is not a legislative act, where does the body get the power to
              perform such an act?

            Mr. Hooper - From the nature of things. It goes behind any legislation. I thought I
              made that matter plain in the commencement of my remarks. I do not think it necessary
              to have two-thirds to pass upon such questions as these, which are preliminary
              questions. If the other construction is to be placed upon this matter, then we have a
              provision which, in many instances, would destroy a legislative body entirely. I
              believe that it is clearly within the record to declare these seats vacant, and that
              there is nothing revolutionary about it. These vacancies exist as manifestly as if
              these parties were physically dead. They are politically dead, and I don't know
              but I might say dead and damned. If that don't constitute a vacancy, I do not
              know what does. 

            Mr. Rice-I can not see that this resolution will get us out of difficulty, I see
              there are no Senators here from the vacant districts, and were we to get the returns
              from the Secretary of State, that would not bring them here. That certain men were
              elected, we all know, but until they appear and are sworn in, they are not Senators.
              Most assuredly you can not force an office upon a man; you can not make him take the
              oath; you can not make a man a member of this Senate against his will. When the
              resolution has spent its force and brings up the fact that these election papers are
              on file in the Secretary's office-until these members come upon this floor and
              are qualified, they have no rights here; they are not Senators. I think the Senator
              from Whitley (Mr. Hooper) takes a broad view of this question of declaring vacancies.
              I have seen Senators come in and take the oath after two weeks; and, according to his
              views, you would declare their seats vacant. I know of one member of the House in 1865
              who did not appear till within a few days of the end of the session, and the House
              never thought of ignoring his right.

             You say you want to find out whether these men have been elected- what for? To see
              whether there has been any resignation? No. The resolution says, to compel the
              attendance of absent members. If they are not members, how can you compel their
              attendance? I will tell you where the difficulty is, and the people will hold us to a
              strict accountability. These members will come into their seats in five minutes. When
              I left home, I cam with instructions from every man I spoke to, to postpone this
              constitutional amendment. Say we will postpone it for ten, fifteen or twenty days. You
              can give assurance by a vote that the sense of this Senate is that the question should
              be postponed.

            Mr. Scott, in his seat-I never will.

            Voices"Never, never!"

            Mr. Rice-Then people will hold you to a strict responsibility. Your hold upon the
              confidence of the people will slip from you in about two years, and this party
              "you have been battling will come into' power. You stand upon the technical
              ground of pride. You stand upon dignity, whilst there are men out here waiting to be
              fed; and there is no appropriation to feed the insane, the deaf, the dumb and the
              blind. And the great Republican party is standing upon a matter of pride and dignity!
              The people will sweep the matter of dignity out of the way. I admit and say, that
              these Democratic gentlemen are refractory, I would put myself upon no humiliating
              terms by signing an agreement. I would organize as we are, and say, as gentlemen and
              as honorable men, that we will take up the necessary legislation and pass it, arid
              when the time comes, we will take up the Constitutional admendment and pass it, if we
              can; and let them take care of themselves.

            Mr. Church interposed-I suppose the Senator acknowledges that he owes these gentlemen
              a debt, and he agrees to pay them, but proposes to give a note?

            Mr. Rice-No sir. I do not acknowledge that I owe them a debt.

            Mr. Cravens-I am willing, for one, to contract that they may fix the day when the
              measure you speak of shall be considered, on condition that they will not be
              revolutionary again, but let the vote be taken.

            Mr. Rice-I want an organization; and I am willing to postpone the consideration of
              the amendment to a day certain. I am willing that they shall run the gauntlet, whether
              they get out before we pass it or not.

            Mr. Bradley-I will ask whether the Senator does not believe that this minority, which
              he calls a faction, or fraction, represent the will of a majority of 75,000 of the
              people of this State?

            Mr. Rice-I have no means of answering.

            Mr. Bradley-I ask whether they do not reflect the will of a majority of 75,000?

            Mr. Rice-The Senator knows I can not answer that. The Democrats themselves did not
              vote in their districts by a thousand or so. It would be a mere expression of
              opinion.

            Mr. Church-I would ask if the same Constitution that protects these gentlemen from
              arrest, the same Constitution that keeps us here day after day without a quorum; if
              the same Constitution that prevents our doing business won't protect the minority
              in their rights after they come in?

            Mr. Rice-Of course it will protect them. These men are not Senators. I can arrest
              every last one of them to-day, by legal process. They have never taken the oath  of office. They are not privileged from arrest.
              History gives a different expression of this matter. A few years ago the Republicans
              were in the minority here; and they required a pledge from the majority in the Senate
              then in session, that certain bills should not be taken up. They did not give it,
              except in the way we now propose. The result was, the Republicans held the Legislature
              at Madison and defeated legislation. These gentlemen are now playing the same game on
              you.

            Mr. Bradley, in his seat-No.

            Mr. Rice-These men went before the people and were put out of power. And it' you
              take the same stand the Democracy'did at that session, you will be put out of
              power too. I do not compare the two cases. I justify the men of 1863. It was a time of
              rebellion and revolution. It was necessary to save the Government intact. They have a
              precedent, and claim that they have a right

            Mr. Church, interrupting-I will ask the Senator if he don't know that the reason
              these Democrats were put out of power was, not because of their acts here, but because
              of th rebellious acts of that party in this Government?

            Mr. Rice-Both. Everything conspired against them. And this was an element against
              them-an element of weakness. They were endeavoring to pass a bill revolutionary in its
              tendency.

            The Senator from Laporte says that 75,000 majority of the people of this State are
              against this amendment. These gentlemen come back instructed by their constituents to
              resign again, if necessary, so as to bring that thing before the people. I am not
              arguing this thing for them, and I don't intend to. You might as well accept the
              state of facts at once, and not spend time in talking and standing upon a point of
              dignity. You say to them, come in. But you forget that you are in the majority, and
              they are in the minority. They say, give us an assurance that you will do a certain
              business in a certain way, and they will come in. These men have a right to come in
              and be sworn or not be sworn. And it is your right to do just as you are doing;"
              but you take the consequences too. My people want legislation, and I came here to do
              it. And I want to get away as quick as possible when it is done. I am willing to give
              that assurance, and do it now for myself-and I speak alone for myself. I give the
              assurance that we will go ahead with the regular business of legislation; that we will
              pass the necessary appropriation bills, and other bills which come op for the
              consideration of the Senate; and that, at a day to be fixed by the Senate, or at a
              time indefinite, we will take that amendment up and try to pass it.

            Mr. Henderson-Have you assurance that any other Senators will stand with you?

            Mr. Rice-I have. And I think the Democratic caucus had a paper that assured them of
              that.

            Mr. Green-Here is the count if it will do you any good. I see it stands 23 to 25.

            Mr. Rice-I make these remarks, because it might as well be done here as caucus. The
              sooner we understand ourselves the better. I think the people the State demand that
              something shall be done, and, if necessary, that we give some assurance in regard to
              this matter. I know that the feeling of the people is with me. I made it a particular
              point to get an expression from every man of note I could meet; and that is the
              universal expression, and I am going to reflect it. You may talk about seats being
              vacant but the people will ask you how the came to be vacant. The people will also
              ask, what is the reason they were kept vacant? Why, we are dignified fellows!

            Mr. Scott, interrupting-Do you say they had pledges from enough to control the action
              of the Legislature?

            Mr. Rice-I so understand it. I say you stand upon dignity-

            Mr. Scott, interrupting.I have given an individual statement, and if they are not
              willing to take my word as a man of honor-

            Mr. Rice-What individual statement?

            Mr. Scott-I am willing to give these gentlemen all the time they want to get out, if
              they want to leave-if it is one two, or five days.

            Mr. Rice-That is my very proposition, and I want the Senate to make it here And, this
              afternoon, we will have a Senate.

            Mr Fisher-A proposition of that kind has been made and signed in writing by a
              sufficient number of members of the two houses to control that thing. That was given
              with the assurance from certain members that it would be satisfactory. I signed such a
              paper. I came here with a view to do that very thing. And I have no hesitancy in
              saying it in the Senate, out of doors, on paper, or anywhere else.

            Mr. Rice-I say that is all this Senate should ask. I desire to draw out Senators, so
              that these men who are here can report to their men the feeling and animus of this
              Senate in regard to that question. A better thing could be not done, than to reduce
              the proposition of the Senator from Vigo [Mr. Scott] to paper, and send it to
              them.

            Voices-"Never," "never!"

            Mr. Gray-What is it?

            Mr. Rice-To give some assurance to these gentlemen.

            Mr. Church-I never will give them a pledge of any kind.

            Mr. Robinson of Madison-Inasmuch as assurances should be given by the Republican
              majority-seventeen members of the two Houses have signed a proposition, which has been
              before this Democratic caucus. And these seventeen have the power to control this
              question. And the caucus have rejected that proposition  by a vote of 25 to 23. All I have to say in regard to that
              fact is, that I signed that paper. I signed it in the first place to test the
              sincerity of the Democratic party; to know whether they were willing to come in and
              take their seats and do the legislation necessary or not. If they vote down this
              proposition, and refuse to they are insincere and hypocritical. I defy them to go
              before the State of Indiana with having rejected that proposition. They have been in
              caucus two days upon that question.

            Mr Bradley-If the Senator will allow me. Of course I don't want to say anything
              about what took place in a Democratic caucus but I desire to say that that question
              has not been disposed of. They are now discussing it at the other end of the
              Capitol.

            Mr Robinson-How long does it require to dispose of a question in a Democratic
              caucus?

            Mr. Bradley, in his seat-Large bodies move slowly.

            Mr. Robinson, of Madison-The vote this morning did not indicate a large body.

            Mr. Cravens-I understand that it takes some time to investigate the character for
              truth and veracity, and the standing of the signers of that paper. [Laughter.]

            Mr. Robinson, of Madison-As far as that question is concerned, the truth and veracity
              of these gentlemen have never been affected by charges of the Democratic party, and I
              think never will. I say, the proposition was made, and the Democratic party have been
              considering it. And if that proposition is accepted, it is clear to every Senator that
              legislation can be done. And if the Democratic party are sincere, they will accept
              that proposition. I do not want to make a speech. I think this matter ought to be
              talked over in a Republican caucus, and not here. Gentlemen have their views and
              opinions, and there we can reconcile those views and opinions.

            Mr. Fisher-I have listened patiently, and have been entertained by the remarks of
              Senators, and have gleaned a good deal of information. I rise riot with the hope of
              imparting information, nor with a desire to make a speech. It seems to me that we have
              got entirely off the question under consideration. That question is the adoption of
              the resolution of the Senator from Jefferson (Mr. Cravens.) There certainly can be no
              harm in the adoption of the resolution. There could be no harm in eliciting the
              information it seeks to obtain. It may do good. We see certain gentlemen traversing
              about streets and these Halls who, we suppose, are members of this body, but we have
              no evidence it. We want that evidence. There is a way of reaching it. This resolution
              points out that way, and I think we should adopt it. When we get that information, if
              we can make it it, available, why, do so. It costs nothing. I know what the design of
              the Democratic members in regard to the Legislature is. These men who report
              themselves as members elect-and I suppose they are, because some of them I know to be
              honorable men-all, indeed, that I have had any conversation with-profess to have an
              earnest desire to progress with the legislation of the State. That is what they come
              here for. But they have not yet taken their seats. They decline to take their seats.
              They say, the design is to spring that amendment: and unless you make certain pledges,
              we won't come in. Now, as a body, I do not think it proper to make them any
              pledges. As an individual, I am ready to make a pledge; and have. My understanding
              was, that the pledge of a sufficient number to control action, with their assistance,
              would be acceptable. I thought it a great letting down of dignity to grant that
              pledge. I thought they had no right to require that pledge. Their duty was to come in
              here, as was our duty, and take their seats. I hold that they had no right to require
              any condition precedent; and, as a body, I am opposed to giving it. As an individual,
              if I have a mind to lower my own dignity by signing a pledge of that kind, I have
              aright to do it.

            Mr. Church interposed-I would ask the Senator if that is not an indecent and corrupt
              proposition.

            Mr. Fisher-I do not know about that. I hold that they had no right to make us any
              proposition. Their duty was to be sworn in. We, being members sworn and qualified to
              do our duty, could not meet them upon equal terms, because they are not such-they are
              not Senators in the general acceptation of the term. They are Senators elect. We are
              Senators in office. Enough of us have given pledges to assure them that one day's
              notice shall be given them before the constitutional amendment is taken up. If they
              are not satisfied, it is clear that they are either insincere in a desire to meet us
              and do the necessary legislation of the State, or else it is their desire to get some
              political advantage. The pledges which have been given secure them against the very
              thing they dread the nigger. It secures them fully, and gives them power to prevent
              its being pushed upon them. They are not satisfied, but they want something else, and
              that is political advantage. And if we are prudent and cautious, we will not give
              that. If they are not willing to accept what is given them, which is ample, let them
              take their own course. I hope we will pass this resolution, and adjourn till
              Monday.

            After further debate, in which Messrs. Church, Fisher, Bradley and Cravens took part,
              the resolution submitted by Mr. Cravens was adopted-yeas 28, nays 2.

            And then-

            On motion of Mr. Cravens the Senate took a recess till 2:30 o'clock. 

            

            
              AFTERNOON SESSION.
              The Lieutenant Governor resumed, and ordered the roll call and a call of the
                unrepresented districts. Twenty-four Senators answered.

              Mr. Wolcott-As the Senate has now no business before it, I move that we adjourn
                till Monday at 2 o'clock.

              Mr. Cravens-I would like to know before we adjourn whether there has been any
                response from the Secretary of State.

              The Lieutenant Governor-The Secretary informs me that the resolution has been
                received, but no response has been made.

              And then the Senate adjourned. 
            
            

          
          

          

          
            SUPPLEMENTARY TO BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS. VOLUME ELEVENTH.

            ORGANIZATION OF THE SENATE---DEBATE IN CONTINUATION.
            IN SENATE.

            
               MONDAY, April 12, 1869
            

            [CONTINUED FROM THE FOOT OF PAGE 36.]

            Mr. WOLCOTT (in conclusion.) I shall advert once more to this section eleven of the
              Constitution: "Two thirds of each House shall constitute a quorum to do business
              ;"-which, of course, cannot mean two thirds of the members elected, because
              abstract members do not constitute a House. The House is composed of members of the
              body. In Congress, when, by resignation or other causes, number is reduced, the two
              thirds is construed to mean two thirds of the actual members. And, in the provision
              which points out the way to make up a quorum when there is no quorum present, the
              Constitution provides that we shall send for absentees. It does not provide for
              holding elections.

            Mr. BRADLEY (interposing.) Suppose on were sworn in, would ten make a majority of
              members of the House? 

            Mr. WOLCOTT. Any general proposition can be pushed to an extreme. The great purpose
              of our Constitution is to provide a representative government; and, when the number of
              representatives is reduced so small, that there ceases to be a representation. I think
              it proper to proceed-

            Mr. BRADLEY (interrupting,) Not until the Senator answers me as to whether the
              Senators sworn in constitute the Senate? Suppose eighteen were sworn in, would not ten
              be a quorum to pass a bill? 

            Mr. WOLCOTT. I have answered the Senator two or three times already; and, if he does
              not understand, the fault is not mine.

            Mr. BRADLEY (in his seat.) Answer the question directly.

            Mr. WOLCOTT. I do not recall the course I intended to pursue; and, as I do not wish
              to keep others waiting, I will yield the floor. 

            Mr. ROBINSON of Decatur. What is the is the gentleman's motion?

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. The Senator from White [Mr. Wolcott] will please reduce his
              motion to writing, and then we will see what it is.

            Mr. HOOPER. I would simply inquire whether my resolution has lost its place?

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. The Senator from White made a motion after the resolution
              was withdrawn, and then gave way to the Senator from Whitley ]Mr. Hooper] for the
              introduction of the resolution again. When the Senator from White sends up his motion,
              we will dispose of that, and then the resolution will come up.

            Mr. WOLCOTT. I suppose it is competent for me to give place to the resolution, and
              let it be disposed of.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. That should be disposed of I suppose.

            Mr. WOLCOTT. I will withdraw my resolution for the time being.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. The resolutions of the Senator from Whitley are before the
              Senate at this time.

            Mr. HOOPER. Mr. President, I do not propose to enter into any discussion of the
              question presented by this resolution to any extent whatever, because I submitted my
              views upon the question on Saturday. But it has been suggested by the Senator from
              Laporte, [Mr. Bradley,] that this matter ought not now to be pressed ; but that we
              ought to wait patiently. How long he would have us to wait he does not tell us-for the
              good reason, I suppose, that he does not know himself.

            Mr. BRADLEY (is his seat.) Just so.

            Mr. HOOPER. I think we have waited patiently long enough; and that the time has come
              when it is our duty to determine upon some policy and upon some course of action.

            Mr. BrADLEY (interposing, and Mr. H. giving way.) If the Senator will allow me I do
              no know exactly how long we will have to wait: but I stated that I thought a
              resolution like this was impolitic, I have received in formation that the House is organized; and, I suppose, if
              that is done, that the Senate will be organized: and I really hope the Senate will
              take no action upon this resolution. I do not mean the Senate. I mean this fraction of
              a Senate. I thought it impolitic to act in this way, lest it might destroy the whole
              object of the orgaization of the House. Because if this body passes a resolution
              declaring the seats of certain Senators vacant, (which I contend it has no right to
              do,) the Governor may act upon it;-I don't believe he will, but possibly he
              may;-and, if he does, we destroy the General Assembly for the present. Hence, I hope
              the Senator will not press his resolution.

            Mr. GREEN. I will ask if the Senator don't think this the most speedy way we can
              organize the Senate?

            Mr. BRADLEY. I think not, I think you will never organize in that way.

            Mr. HOOPER (resuming.) I do not desire to discuss that branch of the subject today,
              because, as I have already stated, I presented my view of that question on Saturday. I
              have no doubt as to the practicability of this mode of organizing the Senate-none
              whatever. While it may be true, that the House is organized, that does not by any
              means perfect the organization of the General Assembly. For all practical purposes, we
              are to-day-as we now stand,just as effectually disorganized as we were on Saturday.
              And now what assurance is the Senator able to give us, that we should further delay in
              adopting our line of policy? Nothing, it seems to me, that we ought to rely upon. I
              think we ought to proceed straight forward in the discharge of our duty, or of what we
              conceive to be our duty; and that is, to adopt a resolution of the character that I
              have introduced. I have introduced this resolution for the purpose of enabling us to
              determine the policy it is best to pursue. I shall not insist upon pressing a vote on
              it now. For I suppose it is a matter of such importance, that it will necessarily
              involve some discussion ; because it is a somewhat unusual state of affairs that now
              surround us. It is for the purpose of presenting this matter-that we may at once
              determine upon the line of action to take-that I offer this resolution ; and, if it
              provokes discussion, now is the time for that discussion, that we may fix upon the
              course we are to adopt, And I feel no disposition to withdraw the resolution, or to
              take any step that would look like further delay, because I think the time for action
              has come. There is nothing new in the situation that requires further delay. It is
              notorious, and it has been for five days past, that the members elect are in the city
              and can come in at any moment and qualify; and allow me to say to the Senator from
              Laporte, (Mr. Bradley) that the most effectual way he can prevent the adoption of the
              resolution or something of this character, is for our friends of the minocity to come
              in and qualify, and take their seats; and that will dispose of this resolution. They
              are here now in the other end of the capitol, and I suppose perhaps, some are in the
              lobbies of this chamber, and if they wish to prevent any such action now is the time
              to come in and prevent it by doing that which is their duty.

            I said there was nothing new in the situation. What I mean by that is, that there is
              nothing now that should induce the minority to come in and take their ssats that would
              press upon them with any more consideration or any more force than at the very first
              day of the session. It has been understood from the first day we assembled that there
              were members both of the House and the Senate of the majority in sufficient numbers to
              control this matter with the aid of the minority, who were determined and intended
              that the appropriation bills should all be passed and the necessary legislation should
              be enacted before the Fifteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States
              shall be taken up. That was distinctly understood-there conld be no mistake about this
              question but it was squarely stated that the majority were not going to make any
              pledges-they were not going to stand by and plead for an organization of this General
              Assembly by making pledges as to what kind of business would be done after the
              organization. It would be a surrender of the principle that the majority should rule,
              to hand over the direction of our business into the hands of the minority. For that
              very reason no pledge of that kind could be made. We, as independent members of the
              General Assembly could not consistently make any such pledge without surrendering our
              right as the majority to govern. It is equally true that this other proposition has
              been well understood, and there could have been no question, if the members of both
              Houses had come in and organized, that this constitutional amendment question would
              not have been taken up until the other important measures of the session had been
              passed upon. Therefore I say there is nothing new in the situation that should induce
              us to delay. If possible, the influences are the other way. I understand that the
              written pledge given by some members has been withdrawn, and therefore there is
              nothing new in the situation that should induce us to think that anything could be
              gained by delay. Therefore I insist, that we should to-day, determine upon the policy
              we should adopt; for it seems to be determined that either this policy shall be
              adopted or the other that has been indicated, namely : that we shall go on and
              legislate with the members we have. I think the resolution is a proper one, but I will
              not stop to discuss the general question, if the Senate does not desire to press a
              vote to-day but prefer to discuss the question, I shall not press the vote myself. 

            

            Mr. President, I am happy to hear the Senator from Whitley [Mr. Hooper] for whom I
              have the highest respect, make the remark that he offered this resolution for the
              purpose of eliciting discussion, and that he did not desire to have it passed
              to-day.

            Mr. HOOPER (interposed.) I said I would not press the vote to-day.

            Mr. BRADLEY. I am placed in an embarrassing situation here. I have to discuss this
              matter against some thirty senators -

            Mr. FISHER (in his seat) only twenty-eight.

            Mr. BRADLEY (continuing:) and they would probably defeat me in the discussion. I am
              aware there is nothing new in the situation except this one fact, and it may not be
              improper for me to state it, although I have the highest respect for the presiding
              officer. At the commencement of our session on a Saturday, the presiding officer
              decided that a resolution like this was not in order. I say this without meaning an
              disrespect to the presiding officer, but simply because I think it was an error.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. The Senator misunderstood the intention as well as the
              position of the presiding officer. The resolution offered by the Senator from Vigo
              [Mr. Scott] at the commencement of the session is very different from the one offered
              this afternoon.

            Mr. BRADLEY. The resolution I refer to was offered by the Senator from Tipton ]Mr.
              Green.]

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. Will the Senator read the resolution.

            Mr. BRADLEY. Yes, sir."

            RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be requested to lay before
              this body, as soon as he can conveniently, a certified statement of the returns for
              the election of Senators in the districts declared vacant by resignation at the close
              of the last session of the General Assembly."

            Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I rise the point of order. There is nobody hereto pass a
              resolution,"

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. The point of order is sustained. No resolution can be passed
              and certified to unless there be two-thirds of the Senate present."

            Then the Senator from Jefferson offered the following resolution:

            RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and he :s hereby
              requested to lay before this body whatever information may be on file in his office in
              respect to the special election, held on the 23d day of March, 1809, to supply the
              vacancies in the General Assembly, occasioned by the resignation of the members
              thereof, on the 4th day of March, 1869, with a view of taking the necessary steps to
              compel the attendance of absent members.

            And I took the position then and there, that we could not make members by calling
              upon the Secretary of State, no matter what he said, he could not make a member. No
              man can become a member until he comes with the proper credentials and qualifies by
              taking the oath of office. Hence no matter what information can be got from the
              Secretary of State we cannot by that information compel the attendance of absent
              members. I took the ground then as I do now, that the last clause of that resolution
              amounts to nothing.

            Mr. CRAVENS (interposing.) I desire to explain in behalf of the presiding officer. At
              the time the presiding officer decided the resolution of the Senator from Tipton [Mr.
              Green] to be out of order, and at the time the Chair decided the resolution of the
              Senator from Vigo [Mr. Scott] to be out of order, I understood the Chair to hold that
              any resolution or any step that looked to a compliance with the power granted us under
              the Constitution to compel the attendance of absent members, would be held as valid
              and in order by the Chair. When I introduced my resolution, as I stated in the last
              clause, it was with a view of taking the necessary steps to compel the attendance of
              absent members. What were the necessary steps?

            Mr. BRADLEY. I cannot give way to the Senator for an argument.

            Mr. CHURCH (interposing.) I will state that the contemplated action of the House has
              been had and the recreant Senators have been sent for.

            Mr. BELLAMY. I call the Senator to order. He has no right to refer to what is going
              on in the other end of the Capitol.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. The opinion I gave on the point of order referred to by the
              Senator from Laporte (Mr. Bradley) is not published in the JOURNAL,
              but it is published in the SENTINEL which he sent to Mr. Bradley.
              It is as follows:

            "The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. As far as the resolution before the Senate now is
              concerned, the Chair will state that on the first day of the session, when the Senator
              from Vigo [Mr. Scot]t offered a resolution, I said that any resolution might be passed
              in the opinion of the Chair, that looked towards enforcement of our rights under the
              Constitution; that is, the right to compel the attendance of absent members. The Chair
              thought the resolution offered by the Senator from Vigo was not that sort of a
              resolution. The Chair is of the same opinion a,s to the resolution offered by the
              Senator from Tipton [Mr. Green.] The resolution now under consideration [Mr.
              Craven's] proposes to obtain information for the purpose of bringing about the
              result desired, to-wit: the organization of the Senate. The Chair is unable to see
              that the passage of the resolution would accomplish the result claimed, but the Chair
              will not undertake to prejudge. The effect that the passage of this resolution would
              have is the attainment of the constitutional end in view, and as it claims on its face
              to be for that purpose, the Chair with a desire to enforce the Constitutional rule
              empowering the body to compel the attendance of absent members, will  entertain the resolution. Admitting that there is doubt as
              to its propriety, the Senate being fully competent to determine whether it will
              accomplish the end it seeks, the Chair will hold the resolution in order, and leave
              the responsibility with the Senate."

            Mr. BRADLEY. I think the Sentinel is the best paper-a good
              deal.

            Mr. CRAVENS. The Chair knew that and therefore sent it to the Senator.

            Mr. BRADLEY. The Senator from Jefferson, [Mr. Cravens,] in his resolution, declares
              what was his view in offering it. But I regard that as of no consequence whatever. The
              question is simply this: What would be the effect of the resolution ? Now, for what
              purpose could we call upon the Secretary of State? What object could we have in view,
              except to receive information as to what election returns were filed in his office
              ?

            Mr. CRAVENS (in his seat.) That is what we want.

            Mr. BRADLEY. That is all. And the same purpose would be effected by the resolution of
              the Senator from Tipton [Mr. Green.] I insist that it is not necessary to insert in a
              resolution what view the author had in offering it; and that is the only difference
              between the two resolutions. The Senator from Tipton simply offered his resolution to
              call for that information. When the Senate got that information, they could act upon
              it in just such a way as they thought proper. The Senator from Jefferson offered the
              same resolution,and in addition, added, that it was offered with a certain view. Now
              the view makes no difference-none in the least-with the question. The whole scope,
              intent and purport of the resolution being to get from the Secretary the information
              as to what returns were filed in his office. We would get that information by one just
              as well as by the other ; and when we had the information we could use it for any
              purpose we choose.

            I also desire to answer the Senator from Whitley [Mr. Hooper ;] but perhaps I need
              not-from the information they have received. I am aware, that whenever a resolution is
              offered here, and the presiding officer rules it in order, it can be passed-I
              don't care what it is. There are twenty eight Senators on one side to vote for
              any such resolution-and but two, or three,or four-there are four now on the other. It
              is useless for us to sit here and battle the resolution. We can only protest against
              it. That was my purpose-simply to offer my solemn protest against it. That is all we
              can do. It is of no use to discuss the question. Our arguments amount to nothing
              against the majority here.

            Mr. SCOTT. I move to postpone the further consideration of the resolution till
              tomorrow at two o'clock. 

            The motion was agreed to.

            Mr. WOLCOTT. The motiun which I offered a while ago and withdrew, I now offer in the
              shape of a resolution, and I move make that also the special order for 2 o'clock
              to-morrow.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR It will be read for information.

            The Secretary read as follows:

            RESOLVED, That inasmuch as there is a quorum of all the members
              that are qualified under the Constitution present the President be and he is hereby
              directed to proceed with the business of the Senate as the same now stands upon the
              Calendar.

            Mr. BRADLEY. I object to that; and I raise the point of order-

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. I think the resolution is not in order.

            Mr. SCOTT. I move that the districts be called where vacancies exist, and also the
              names of the Senators elect.

            Mr. BRADLEY. They will be here in few minutes.-They are not here yet.-I have sent for
              them. [Laughter.]

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. Does the Senator withdraw his motion?

            Mr. SCOTT. Yes sir.

            Mr. ARMSTRONG. I move that we have a recess for fifteen minutes.

            The motion was rejected.

            * * * *

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. The Secretary will now call the Districts, with the names of
              the Senetors reported as elected therefrom.

            Mr. BRADLEY. I request that the call may be suspended for a short time, when they
              will all be here.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. Certainly, sir.

            Mr. RICE. I move that the Sergeant-at-arms be instructed to act in concert with the
              detachment sent out by the Senator from Laporte, in bringing them in. (Laughter.)

            Mr. TAGGART. He has three Aids-he may do without the assistance of the Sergeant at
              Arms.

            Subsequently-the Senators elect appearing in the Chamber-

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. The Secretary will now call the Districts, with the names of
              the Senators said to be elected from those Districts; and Senators will come forward
              and present their credentials when their names are called.

            And, accordingly, as their names were called, the newly elected Senators came forward
              to the area in front of the President's Desk, submitted their Credentials and
              took the oath of office as Senators at the hand of Judge Chapman, of the Marion
              Crimininal Circuit Court, in the following words: "You and each of you do
              solemnly Swear to support the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution
              of the State of Indiana, and  best of your
              ability discharge your duty as Senators in the General Assembly of the State of
              Indiana. So help you God."

            So the Senate of the Forty Sixth General Indiana determined a Constitutional Quorum,
              by the qualification of Senators elected in March, namely:

            
              From Vanderbgh.District . . . Danl.Morgan.
              Knox and Daviess..............W. S. Turner.

            SUPPLEMENTARY TO THE BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.VOLUME ELEVENTH.
            Proposed Amendments to the Constitution of the United
              States----The Fifteenth Article----Debate in Continuation.
            IN SENATE.

            
              TUESDAY, April 13, 1869. 
            

            [CONTINUED FROM PAGE 41, VOLUME XI.]

            Mr. CRAVENS. Mr. President: I know, and I suppose it is known to every Senator on
              this floor, that the people demand of their public servants the discharge of their
              duties; and they especially demand that the necessary and important legislation of the
              State shall be completed. It is well known also that the minority in this and the
              other branch of the General Assembly have determined, and are still determined, that a
              legal vote shall not be taken on the proposition to ratify the XVth
              amendment to the Constitution of the United States. I know very well, Mr. President,
              that, sooner or later, a compact and determined minority is a power that must be
              recognized.-While I, for one, would not, as a representative of the people, make any
              undignified or improper pledges or contracts for the purpose of having legislation
              attended to-which is as much binding on one as another of us-I am disposed to accept
              the situation.

            This Constitutional Amendment has never been before this body, or the other, for
              action. It was simply presented through the message of the Governor; and there never
              has been a joint resolution presented for its ratification and acceptance. In that
              view of the case, I think, perhaps, the action of the minority was not at all
              necessary. But since the House has been organized, with a view to giving time to
              perfect and complete the necessary and indispensable legislation of the State, and for
              the purpose of giving time to our Democratic friends to mature their plans, I have a
              proposition which I intend to offer this morning. It is a proposition of a valid
              character. In the first place, 1 propose to offer a joint resolution ratifying and
              accepting the Constitutional Amendment as proposed by the Congress of the United
              States, so that it may be a question properly before the body. Then I intend to offer
              another resolution: and the object I have in view I intend to state frankly -end
              squarely. I am satisfied that this Legislature will not have the opportunity of voting
              with a quorum of either House, perhaps, on this proposition. And, in order that this
              proposition may not be before either body at the demand of the majority, or as a
              terror to the minority, I propose to make a disposition of it.-I now offer a joint
              resolution ratifying the Constitutional Amendment ; and I shall keep the floor until
              it is read, that I may offer the other resolution.

            The Secretary read as follows:

            
              
                
                  A JOINT RESOLUTION Accepting and Ratifying a certain Amendment to the
                    Constitution of the United States.

                  WHEREAS, Congress has, by a two-thirds vote, proposed to the
                    Legislatures of the several States, an Amendment to the Constitution of the
                    United States, which, when Ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the
                    States, shall be valid, to all intents and purposes, as a Part of this
                    Constitution, namely:

                  
                    
                      
                        "ARTICLE XV.

                        "SECTION 1. The right of the Citizen of the
                          United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United
                          States, nor by any State, on account of race, color or previous condition
                          of servitude.

                        "SEC. 2. The Congress shall have power to enforce
                          this article by appropriate legislation:"
                      
                    
                  

                   Wherefore-

                  Be it Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of Indiana, That said
                    Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States is hereby  Accepted and Ratified on the part of the
                    State of Indiana:
                
              
            

             Mr. CRAVENS. Now Mr. President, the resolution is before the body, and in order to
              dispose of it for the present and in order that it not be in the way of
              legislation-

            Mr. JOHNSON of Montgomery. Is this the first reading of the joint resolution?

            LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. A joint resolution is not required to be read three times. At
              least it has been the custom here to read joint resolutions but once. 

            Mr. CRAVENS. Now for the purpose of disposing of this resolution, and getting clear
              of it for the present, and in order to fix the when it shall be considered, I offer
              the following resolution.

            Resolved by the Senate, the House of Represents concurring, That the consideration of
              the Resolution accepting and ratifying, on the part of Indiana the proposed Fifteenth
              Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, be postponed and made the special
              order for action at 2 o'clock on Tuesday, the eleventh day of May next ensuing,
              in joint Assembly of the two Houses to be held in the Hall of the House of
              Representatives on said day and at said hour.

            Mr. CRAVENS. Now, Mr. President, the resolution explains itself. It is a postponement
              to a particular time, and in order that we may get clear of it, after explaining it I
              demand the previous question.

            Mr. HANNA. There is such a thing as fairness in all transactions. The passage of
              resolution is intended to legalize a joint meeting of the two Houses. 

            Mr. CRAVENS. I attempted an explanation; that I thought would be satisfactory to the
              majority and to the minority here. I will say this proposition has not been the
              subject matter of any agreement in any Republican caucus. I want to place this
              Fifteenth Amendment; so that it will be before both Houses. Senators know it is in the
              same position as if House would make it the order for a special day and hour; there
              would be no quorum either branch, and if it is made the order in joint Assembly, the
              probability is that it would be the same thing; so in point of fact it amounts to the
              same.

            Mr. HANNA. I hope the Senator will withdraw the motion for the previous question.
              This a proposition to raise a joint convention of the two Houses, and that is outside
              of understanding.

            Mr. CRAVENS. If there is any understanding about it, I do not know it. 

            Mr. HANNA. The House postponed it till llth of May without the concurrence of senate.
              I move to strike out Mr. CHURCH (interposing.) The previous question having been
              demanded the motion to amend is not in order.

            Mr. HANNA. I ask the members of the majority whether they want to stop this
              session-

            Mr. GIFFORD (in his seat.) I desire to leave in case this is pressed.

            Mr. CHURCH. I hope the Senator will have an opportunity to leave.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. The previous question having been demanded, the Chair is
              obliged to stop the discussion. As many Senators as second the demand for the previous
              question will rise and stand till counted17. As many as are opposed will rise20. The
              demand is not seconded. The question recurs upon the resolution offered by the Senator
              from Jefferson [Mr. Cravens.]Mr. HANNA. I move now to strike out that portion
              providing for a joint convention of the two Houses.

            The motion was rejected by yeas 20, nays 24, as follows:

            
              
                
                  YEAS-Messrs, Bird, Bradley, Carson, Denbo, Gifford, Hanna,
                    Henderson, Hooper, Huffman, Humphreys, Jaquess, Johnson of Spencer, Johnson of
                    Montgomery, Laselle, Lee, Montgomery, Morgan, Sherrod and Taggart-20.

                  NAYS-Messrs, Andrews, Armstrong, Beardsley, Bellamy, Case,
                    Church, Cravens, Eliott, Fisher, Fosdick, Gray, Green, Hadley, Hamilton, Hess,
                    Kinley, Rice, Reynolds, Robinson of Madison, Robinson of Decatur, Scott, Stein,
                    Wolcott and Wood-24.
                
              
            

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. So the amendment does not prevail. The question recurs on
              the passage of the resolution.

            Mr. HANNA. I do not want to act hastily about this matter. I want to make one more
              effort in good faith. Therefore for the present I move to lay both resolutions on the
              table till we can have a talk with our friends.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. It is not competent to move to lay two subjects on the
              table, but inasmuch as these seem to belong to each other, it may be proper, though I
              am not quite clear about it.

            The motion was entertained by the Chair, the yeas and nays were called, and-

            Mr. ANDREWS, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said : I really
              wish to take no advantage of our opponents in regard to this question.

            Mr. HANNA (interposing.) I withdraw my motion for the present, as several Senators
              say they want to hear the question discussed. I will say that this matter has been
              postponed by the branch in the other end of the Capitol, as we are informed by the
              proceedings of the House as published, till the 11th of May, and if this resolution is
              adopted in the form it is now, it will have to go to the House for concurrence. Now,
              according to parliamentary law it has passed beyond their control till the 11th of
              May, and there will be a great deal of time consumed in its discussion there even if
              this resolution is passed here. We had private assurances from many members of the
              opposition who are honorable gentlemen and who will stand by their pledges, that the
              consideration of this question should be postponed  till after the legitimate business of the session should be disposed of, and then
              after the House met they adopted a resolution putting off this matter till the 11th of
              May. Now it appears to me to undertake to raise a joint convention of the two Houses
              for the purpose of considering the Constitutional Amendment, is not acting in good
              faith to the minority here, and I say for one I stand here opposed to it. I say the
              minority are ready to take up the legitimate legislation necessary to carry on the
              affairs of the State government, and perhaps a great deal more, and go on and discuss
              and perfect and complete and carry it forward, but we stand here desiring to oppose
              the adoption of the Constitutional Amendment. The House has fixed a day when they will
              consider it, and if you see proper to sit here and fix a day when you will consider
              it, well and good, and if we see proper to get out of the way by resigning that is a
              matter of our own.

            In my judgment this kind of legislation cannot take place by the joint meeting of the
              two Houses; but that is a matter that has been extensively discussed in the public
              prints; certainly we cannot get in a joint convention by the action of the separate
              branches unless there is a quorum present to adopt the resolution to get in there; and
              you ask us to adopt a resolution for a joint convention when in good faith we ought
              not to sit here and let you do it. I do not put it upon the ground that you have the
              power, if we stay here, to pass it, but upon the ground that it is not good faith to
              adopt that resolution now. We are willing to take the responsibility of getting out of
              the way when you attempt to pass this Constitutional amendment but we don't want
              to get out now, yet if you are going to press it in this shape I am not going to say
              that we will stand here and allow you to do it.

            The Senator from Jefferson (Mr. Cravens) says he wants this amendment before the
              Senate. All I have got to say to that is, that the Constitutional amendment was before
              this Senate in the form in which Congress, I suppose, required it to get here, and
              that was through the Executive branch of the Government. The Governor has laid it
              before us. The form that has been usual is the adoption of a joint resolution
              ratifying it by the separate action of the two branches of the Legislature-not in
              joint convention. Now this joint resolution introduced by the Senator from Jefferson
              looks to that kind of legislation which has been usual and ordinarily adopted, and
              that is that each branch shall act separately upon the joint resolution adopting or
              ratifying the Constitutional amendment. That is the first resolution offered by the
              Senator from Jefferson, he then accompanies that with a resolution of the Senate to be
              concurred in by the House, by which, instead of pursuing the usual course, there is to
              be a joint convention of what may be left of the two branches on the 11th of May for
              the purpose of acting upon this matter. To that portion we object, and why? Simply
              because it is outside of the arrangement we with men that we consider honorable and we
              will stand by their pledges that the consideration of this matter would not be taken
              until some future day placed at such long time distant that we can perfect all
              necessary legislation.

            Mr. RICE (interposing.) Does not the resolution effect that purpose?

            Mr. HANNA. Not in the ordinary mode. In making arrangements with gentlemen never look
              for extraordinary proceedings. Where an amendment to the Federal Constitution is to be
              ratified it is usually done by separate action of each branch of the Legislature. The
              House so understands it, and has adopted a simple resolution, as you may see by
              referring to the published proceedings, postponing this matter till the 11th day of
              May then a motion was made to reconsider and that motion laid on the table. According
              to all parliamentary law that question is beyond the reach of the House till the 11th
              day of May, and therefore this concurrent resolution if adopted here will attempt to
              open up a question which is settled there till the 11th day of May and thus throw into
              the House a very disturbing element. The House in good faith carried out the agreement
              made between gentlemen and I hope the Senate will do the same thing.

            Mr. CHURCH (interposing.) I would like to ask if Mr. Pierce of Porter, who offered
              that resolution in the House, or Mr. Wildman, who demanded the previous question
              thereon had made any pledges with any man as far as the Constitutional amendment is
              concerned?

            Mr. HANNA. I do not know anything about it, except that there was an agreement
              between gentlemen. I am not a member of the House and therefore made no agreement with
              members of the House. Members of the House made an agreement between themselves and
              members of the Senate did the same; and as I said before, I hope it will be carried
              out here in good faith. If a simple resolution be adopted fixing the 11th day of May
              for the consideration of the Constitutional amendment; the minority stand ready to go
              on with the legislation of the State, for I assure you Mr. President, there is no
              disposition on the part of the minority to avoid legislation upon any single question
              affecting the welfare and the interests of the people of the State.

            Mr. GREEN. I infer from the gentleman's speech that he has an arrangement with
              gentlemen upon this floor.

            Mr. HANNA. I say I only have the word of gentlemen, and when given it is always  binding. I have no arrangement with them. 

            Mr. GREEN. Have you the word of gentlemen not to broach this question? 

            Mr HANNA. I only have their word that the consideration of this matter in relation to
              the ratification of the Constitutional amendment shall be postponed till some future
              time, regarding it in reference to the usual legislative mode of considering it, I
              object to this extraordinary mode of proceeding.

            Mr RICE. If I understand the Senator's remarks he holds that there is no
              difference between the validity of action whether this resolution be passed by a
              majority in each House or whether by a majority when the Houses are together on
              concurrent vote. I wish to know if that is the Senator's opinion. If the effect
              would be the same, then there is no extraordinary measure proposed.

            Mr. HANNA. According to my judgment is a lawyer, there would be no difference between
              one course and the other. But I will state what I suppose to be the object of the
              Senator from Jefferson [Mr. Cravens] though I did not desire to anticipate it. It is a
              part of the history of the country when by joint action of each branch of the General
              Assembly they were convened together for a certain purpose-the counting of the votes
              for Governor-at the end of counting the votes the officer presiding over the joint
              Assembly assumed the responsibility (which the Senator from Jefferson assumed last
              session) to control that body and adjourn it at such time as he thought proper. That
              was done upon a previous occasion some years ago. After that the joint convention met
              upon the day the presiding officer designated for the purpose of taking into
              consideration questions before them, among which arose the election of United States
              Senators.

            Mr. CHURCH. Was that when Bright and Fitch were elected?

            Mr. HANNA. Yes sir. That action whether legitimate or not it is not for me to say,
              but it was so considered on the ground that there was a quorum of each House present
              at the time they adopted a resolution to go into joint convention. Now this attempt on
              the part of the Senator from Jefferson, if this is his view of the subject, to reenact
              that very thing when the House has taken a different view of it and the minority have
              taken a different view, is not right. I say all we ask is fair play, we don't
              want to stop legislation. It seems to me we had better go along with it. Fair dealing
              requires that we should go on in the ordinary and usual mode, and postpone this
              question and get clear of this disturbing element in the minds of Senators.

            Mr. CRAVENS. Mr. President, I want to see this matter talked about and discussed in
              good feeling but there is one tone or temper manifested by the Senator from Sullivan
              [Mr. Hanna] that I don't exactly admire, and that is he keeps intimating that the
              proposition under consideration is an evidence of a want of fair dealing.

            Mr. HANNA (interposing.) I did .not say on your part. You have already disavowed that
              this is an action of a Republican caucus, or that they are bound by it, therefore I
              only called upon Senators who made these pledges to see that fair play was had.

            Mr. CRAVENS. There has been no time since that amendment was forwarded to the
              Executive of this State by the Secretary of State of the United States that I would
              not have subordinated it to the passage of necessary legislation. At the end of the
              last session I did make an engagement with the Senator from Sullivan and other
              Senators, and that was this: and it is the only engagement I ever have entered into.
              On the Tuesday morning previous to the time the Democratic Senators resigned, the
              Senator from Sullivan, I believe sincerely anxious that legislation should be
              forwarded, stated the fact that the minority were disposed to resign on that morning
              unless they got an assurance that the Constitutional amendment should not be taken up
              out of order. I, with others, told him that as far as we were concerned it should not
              come up, and even if the caucus decided to take it up out of order I proposed that he
              should have timely notice. That was reiterated by us in the caucus. But it
              unfortunately was stated that myself and other Senators on this floor had gone back
              upon our engagements, and when I came back here, after it had been spoken about in the
              districts, I determined that I would not in any way enter into any engagement:-I would
              let legislation go before I would, because I regarded the vote upon that
              Constitutional amendment as a necessary act of legislation of the State-one that I was
              under obligations to see perfected. Therefore I have made no engagements, and I have
              offered this in simple good faith. What is it, sir? Simply a question of postponement,
              and a way by which the whole subject might be removed from this branch and the other
              branch, so that it should not be an element for the delay of legislation, and so the
              majority should have no temptation to seize it out of its order I propose to put it in
              that position. What is the position? As I said when up before, if we made it the
              special order for the 11th of May in this body and the other branch it is more than
              probable, nay, more, I know that when the time comes for taking it up we will again be
              without a quorum. These men will act consistently and as I said before it is a power
              we must recognize: and I say so still. And more, if this body would not be competent
              to do business without a quorum and the other body would not, would the two bodies
              together be any more competent? But I know what these gentlemen want.  It is a political advantage they are demanding, and I know
              they intend to have it as far as they are able to control it, and all I ask is that we
              be put upon an equal footing with you. I am not going to interfere with any measure
              you undertake for the accomplishment of your purpose; nor could I interfere if I
              desired it. It is simply for us to determine whether that mode would be legal or
              illegal. As to the question whether it would be legal or not Congress or the Supreme
              Court will decide if we take that mode. But I well recollect the case the Senator from
              Sullivan [Mr. Hanna] speaks of. That Convention never was ordered by either branch of
              the General Assembly. Resolution after resolution for that purpose was introduced into
              this body. I then was in this body and belonged to the majority, but no resolution was
              passed. And no resolution ever passed the other House because when a resolution was
              introduced in that House the minority walked out So a resolution was never passed in
              either body, yet we all know what the result was. And if we simply wanted to rely upon
              that case as a precedent this would make no difference whatever. The question, the
              whole question and all that there is involved in this resolution is simply a
              proposition for its postponement And for what purpose? Only that the majority and
              minority may go to work and do their duty in reference to local, home legislation.
              Then why refuse to pass it?

            Mr. BRADLEY, (interposing.) Does the Senator assert seriously that that is all there
              is in it.

            Mr CRAVENS. That is all I can see in it.

            Mr. BRADLEY. Does it not say that on a certain day it shall be considered in joint
              Convention.

            Mr. CRAVENS. Yes sir.

            Mr. BRADLEY. That is what I object to.

            Mr. CRAVENS. Why do they object to that? They say by their every action that less
              than two-thirds can do no business. We know what their purpose is in asking a
              postponement of this. As far as I know these men have never asked that they should
              have more than one or two days notice before this amendment question should be taken
              up. Now we give them twenty odd days-nearly a month. If they really are desirous, and
              I have no doubt some of them, perhaps all of them are, to complete the legislation for
              which almost every interest is languishing and every man, women and child in the state
              is clamoring, they would go forward with the legislation now. As this is only a
              reference to the resolution to a body which they say is illegal; if illegal why do
              they object to having it sent there? These men have stood out upon that principle,
              they have resigned upon that principle, and come back here demanding pledges. If we
              can do no business as parts of one whole, how in the name of heaven can that whole do
              business! It seems to me to be a very clear proposition; but if we are disposed to
              take the risk well and good. The main object I had in view was to postpone this
              question to a day certain, and place it out of the power of either House to take snap
              judgement upon the minority; and yet the minority oppose it.

            I have made them a fair proposition - a proposition that in my humble judgement
              conflicts with no obligation; for, as far as I have heard from these men, all that has
              been asked was that no action should be had without at least one two or three at most,
              days notice. How we give them twenty days - nearly thirty days notice. Where is the
              sincerity of their profession to discharge their duties to do the legal legislation
              for which the people of the state are clamorous?

            Every one knows that the object these men had in resigning was to carry this
              proposition as an issue in the canvass of 1870. I care not so much about the fate of
              the proposition but am anxious that it should be disposed of an not go there as a
              disturbing element. I will take all fair and honest advantages to have this thing
              ratified, but if I can not accomplish it honestly let it fall and go into the canvass
              of 1870.

            But why do these men oppose this resolution? We have seventeen days in this month,
              and eleven in the next. All legislation needed by the people can be taken up and
              perfected, and then as we approach this matter gentlemen can retire if they are
              disposed to do so.

            But I had another object in view, and that object was conceived in deference to that
              very power we say we are bound to recognize; and that was that these gentlemen need
              not resign unless they choose to do so, because you would be as effectually free from
              any contact as if yon had resigned. I put it at an hour when it would not be necesary
              for you to be present at the hour of two o'clock, when all parties could go from
              their hotels and boarding places without going from one chamber to the other. Why this
              opposition I can not conceive unless these gentlemen honestly believe it would be a
              legal mode of ratification.

            Mr. HANNA (interposing.) Will the Senator permit me? Do you believe a ratification by
              a mere majority would be legal?

            Mr. CRAVENS. I will say to the Senator this: I have some doubts about it.

            Mr. HANNA. Do you believe it would be legal if ratified in each House separately by a
              mere majority - there being no quorum?

            Mr. CRAVENS. Not till we had exhausted out constitutional power to secure that
              quorum. I am not even fully clear that a majority of this body and the other body
              would be a working Legislature, but I say if we
              were willing to take the risk of passing it in this House and House without a quorum
              we would be equally willing to take the risk and let the authorities who have to pass
              upon it determine the question as to its validity. I do not want this discussion to
              come up, I wish to take an quiet vote. I had no idea our friends would make any
              objection to this vote. I had no idea our friends would make any objection to this
              vote. I had in view the entire removal of this question from before both branches of
              the General Assembly. If that action is illegal it can't hurt these gentlemen to
              adopt it, and if it is legal and we pass it, I say we have triumphed over them, when
              they were trying to get a political advantage over us. It is a question so far as we
              are concerned. As far as we are concerned the have a certainty; and hit is if they
              continue to resign, they will carry this matter into the canvass of 1870. Now
              admitting it to be a fact, for the sake of argument, that we propose to gain political
              advantage we are taking very heavy risks-a risk that will have to be passed upon in
              all human probability by the Supreme Court of the United States. Suppose that simply
              by the vote of the state of Indiana this amendment should be ratified, and it be
              passed by this State in the way proposed, Congress would not pass upon it. When they
              undertook to make laws under that amendment it would have to be a question for the
              Supreme Court. But I am not going to discuss the legality of the thing. I am not
              prepared to say whether that would be a legal view or not; the main purpose I have is
              the postponement to a day that would leave both branches of the General Assembly free
              to proceed with necessary legislative business. As far as risks are concerned they are
              all on our side.

            Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President: From the time I first took an interest in politics, I have
              had but one opinion upon this question, ind that is that a joint convention without a
              quorum of the two House was a nullity. That has been my opinion, and that has been the
              doctrine of the party I have acted with. And that was the opinion of the party at the
              time that thing occurred that has been referred to on this floor, and I don't
              think we have had any other opinion upon that subject. I don't know that the
              Democrats ever held as a strict question of law that that election was legal. It was
              only made so by the Senate of the United States; perhaps as a matter of necessity more
              than law. Holding that view of the question-believing that a joint meeting without a
              quorum of the two Houses would be illegal, I cannot see that this is a breach of good
              faith. It is supposed of course, that there will not be a quorum at that time, and
              under that supposition that if a quorum is not here any action would be illegal-I
              cannot see that it would be a breach of any faith on the part of gentlemen who have
              made some statements to those on the opposite side of this House. I have made some
              statements, and I will live up to them. But when they hold up to me a matter that is a
              violation of law and say that is a breach of faith, I don't think their position,
              is tenable. If gentlemen upon the other side of this floor can satisfy me that a joint
              convention witout a quorum is a legal body I am ready to stand up to what I hold to be
              the statements I made and act upon them in good faith. That is the difficulty with me.
              And my conviction is strong upon that point, and I wait for light. I only have their
              own precedent. They now deny the legality of it. With my convictions of law and duty I
              am in favor of this proposition.

            Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President: Whatever act I have performed in bringing in a quorum of
              the Senate was done upon the faith and promises made to me personally by Senators in
              the opposition party; entirely so. Not by any written pledge, but verbal promises made
              by Senators on the other side, and those promises were that this question should not
              be considered until the day named. The understanding we made was distinct. This
              question was not to be considered. Strange as it may seem these gentlemen insist that
              there is nothing in this resolution but a postponement of the question until that day.
              It is strange when there is a further fact that it also provides that on that day
              there shall be a Joint Convention of the two Houses. If you leave that out I would be
              glad to have it passed. But if it is insisted that that shall remain and that this
              Senate now, having us in here, and having a constitutional quorum, shall go so far
              upon the passage of the resolution ratifying the constitutional amendment as to
              provide the mode by which it shall he passed, I must, I can not avoid regarding it as
              a breach of good faith; and a persistency in that, I am sorry to say, will put it out
              of my power forever to trust the promises of gentlemen from that side.

            Mr. GIFFORD. Mr. President: I am no lawyer and consequently cannot say what bearing
              this proposition will have in the Congress of the United States, but I know my
              position upon the subject before the Senate. I came up here fully instructed to vote
              and use my influence to prevent the ratification of this proposed amendment to the
              Constitution of the United States until the people have had a fair opportunity to
              express themselves at the polls on this subject. I am instructed to resign at every
              full and change of the moon if necessary to defeat it. (Laughter.) It is not necessary
              for me to discuss the matter. I expect to obey my instructions. I did not come up here
              to betray my constituents. I do not think any Republican member is bound to press this
              question, especially those who were elected two 
              years ago. If they had resigned as we did and had come up here with instructions how
              to act on this question, we would expect them to have the vote taken at this session;
              but as they are not in that position-having refused to go before the people-I think it
              not proper that they should press this question, at least until they give us notice
              and then we expect to resign. I came in here expecting that they would give us at
              least one day's notice. All I ask is to let this go over one day, and if I am
              here to-morrow morning you may act upon it. "We were promised one day's
              notice and I don't want but one day.

            Mr. CHURCH. I would like the Senator to give the names-

            Mr. GIFFORD. We are not allowed to give the names until we have been betrayed.

            Mr. CHURCH. Is the promise in writing ?

            Mr. GIFFORD. It is in my noggin-in my head-and my veracity will pass in my
              county.

            Mr. HOOPER. Mr. President: I realize that this is a question of some importance and
              we ought to give it a fair and deliberate consideration. I am glad that this matter
              has been discussed in good temper. I am sure I would regret that the minority on this
              floor should be placed in a position by which they should be led to believe that there
              had been an act of bad faith on the part of the majority here or any portion of the
              majority, and by which my friend from Laporte (Mr. Bradley) would be placed in a
              position to hereafter and forever place no further confidence in the word of the
              majority. Now what is the condition of this question ? It seems to me it is precisely
              this : The plea that the minority has made in reference to the consideration of this
              question all the way through has been that it shall not be acted upon hastily; that
              they shall have sufficient time to consider it, and that it shall not be pressed upon
              them. Now this very proposition is one to continue the consideration of this question
              to a future time; giving them not only one or two days, as they claim has been
              promised to them, but absolutely giving them some thirty days before we propose to
              take this matter up and act upon it. Now, is not that the material question involved
              in that resolution? It seems to me it is.

            Another question has incidentally come up. Gentlemen have said that the adoption of
              this resolution would be a step towards legalizing the ratification of the
              Constitutional Amendment, and that is the position of the minority upon this question.
              As I have said before, a convention called in the mode this resolution proposes to
              call one, and the adoption of this amendment by such convention would not amount to
              anything. Then what harm could be done by the adoption of this resolution? I have
              myself always entertained that view of this question, and it has been fairly presented
              in the progress of the debate upon this very issue. If we believed that getting into a
              joint convention without a constitutional quorum would be legal and proper, we might
              have done so after the other resignation. We acted upon a different theory, and now
              this proposition is one made for the purpose of determining the mode of ratification
              upon the theory that we will have a quorum. Taking this view of the question I cannot
              see any bad faith in this proposition. I have not given the subject that investigation
              I ought to perhaps, but my present view is that if a quorum was not here then the
              adoption of this Constitutional Amendment without a quorum would be operative and
              void. Therefore I say no act of bad faith whatever. It is simply providing a mode by
              which we propose to act upon the theory that the minority will be here with us.

            Mr. BRADLEY. If that is the Senator's opinion what good purpose will be effected
              bv the adoption of this resolution?

            Mr. HOOPER. It will do this good: it will fix and determine the mode by which we
              propose to act. I can see no reason why we should not to-day fix upon the mode we
              propose to adopt in the disposition of this amendment, for that is precisely what it
              amounts to. Let them break up this Legislature upon this simple proposition to
              postpone action till the 11th of May if they dare.

            Mr. HANNA. The minority is not oposed to the postponement, but to fixing the manner
              and mode of ratifying this amendment.

            Mr. HOOPER. I understood the Senator to say that the ratification would be illegal
              and unconstitutional without a quorum present.

            Mr. HANNA. I did not say so.

            Mr. HOOPER. I understood him to take that position. It comes with ill grace from the
              minority to present any such question as that, for they are the very men that is the
              very party that has acted upon that theory. It was the question they presented in the
              election of Bright and Fitch. They acted upon that theory and while it might do for a
              United States partizan Senate to admit members who had been elected in that way, yet I
              cannot hold to its legality.

            Mr. BRADLEY (interposing.) The party did not act upon that theory. They did not pass
              any resolution for such a convention.

            Mr. HOOPER. They tried but did not succeed; that is the only trouble. But while it
              might do for a partizan Senate to admit members elected in that mode, where their
              judgment was final and not to be overruled by any other tribubal, I do doubt upon an
              issue like this-the adoption of a matter of so much importance as an amendment to the
              Constitution of the United States-whether the United  States Senate would admit it as having been legally
              adopted, when the question might be reached in some other way.

            Mr. HANNA. Mr. President: The opinion I expressed as to the validity or invalidity of
              the ratification of the Constitutional amendment was in reference solely to its
              adoption by joint convention. I did not present any opinion upon the other point. But
              I will say now very frankly, for we should be frank, that there are serious
              difficulties in the way. The Constitution of the United States provides that it shall
              take three-fourths of the Legislatures of the several States or by Conventions in
              three-fourths thereof, as the one or the other mode may be proposed by Congress, to
              ratify amendments proposed to the Constitution of the United States. Now observe the
              language: "when ratified by the Legislatures of three-fourths of the
              States." What is the Legislature of a State? Two Houses acting separately each
              for itself, constitute a legislature. In view of that fact I expressed some doubts as
              to the ratification by a joint convention being legal. But still in the case of Bright
              and Fitch it is different. The language of the Federal Constitution in regard to
              United States Senators is that they shall be "chosen by the Legislature" of
              each State. Some Legislatures-and a great many of them-elect by concurrent act, each
              branch voting separately, and whenever they concur on the same man, declare him
              elected Senator. Under our State Constitution the Legislature was bound to come
              together, to count the votes cast at the election of the fall previous for Governor
              and Lieutenant Governor. A certain day was fixed and they came together, and were
              adjourned to a day fixed by the presiding officer on his own volition. Upon that day
              there was a majority of each House together. They came together by virtue of the
              Constitution of the State. Certainly there was a quorum of each House present in the
              first place when the resolution was passed resolving to go into the Convention.

            Mr. CRAVENS (interrupting.) I beg pardon: A majority of the Senators were on the
              other side of the House. Time and again a solution had come from the House or been
              introduced here, but we understood what was to be done and we resisted all the time
              the passage of any resolution and no resolution ever passed; nor was there a
              quorum-

            Mr. HANNA. That makes the case still wronger which I am going to put. As the federal
              Constitution requires that the Legislatures shall elect Senators, and the same
              Constitution requires that the Legislatures shall ratify amendments, then if they
              cannot elect a Senator with less than a quorum they cannot ratify an amendment in like
              manner. The trouble is to get in joint Convention. You cannot get there unless the law
              or Constitution authorizes the meeting. There the Constitution compels the two Houses
              to meet for the purpose of counting the votes for Governor and Lieutenant Governor,
              but here it is proposed by the action of the two branches of the Legislature to fix
              the time, and mode, and manner, and place in which we shall assemble to act in
              reference to the ratification of the proposed amendment to the Constitution of the
              United States. And I say it is not good faith on the part of the men who have pledged
              themselves to us that this amendment shall not be taken up till certain notice shall
              be given to us: for if we adopt this resolution it is in effect taking the first
              primary and principal step towards the ratification of this amendment and we are not
              going to stand here and see it done.

            Mr. CRAVENS. The Senator is throwing some light upon the subject, and I will ask him
              if the constitution of the United States don't make an express grant of power to
              Congress to regulate the manner and mode of the election of United States
              Senators?

            Mr. HANNA. Yes sir. But we have a later act which did not exist at the time of the
              election of Bright and Fitch. At the time they were elected there was no time, nor
              mode, nor manner prescribed otherwise than that each State should choose by the
              Legislature thereof two United States Senators. But now now we are called upon here to
              fix the time, fix the manner and fix the place in which we shall meet and consider the
              question of ratification of the Constitutional amendment, and I say by that act we
              would take the first and primary step toward ratification.

            Mr. BELLAMY. If we pass a resolution of this Senate fixing the time and a certain
              day, will not that fix the time the place and manner?

            Mr. HANNA. My answer is at hand. We would fix the time and manner of acting but by
              each House independent of the other, because that is the usual mode. When that time
              arrives, if there is no quorum you have already determined at the last session that
              there is no power to proceed any further. Now you can't get into joint convention
              except by the adoption of a resolution of each body, and no resolution can be adopted
              but by the action of a quorum. Now you ask us to sit here and do this thing when we
              have acted upon the faith of the pledges of gentlemen that we shan't be trapped.
              We can't stand still and do this.

            Mr. GRAY. As I understand the Senator he would have no objection to a simple
              resolution. This is a concurrent resolution.

            Mr. HANNA. But it fixes the time and mode and manner.

            Mr. GRAY. I understand the House has postponed this question till the 11th of May,
              and that a motion to reconsider was laid on  the
              table. I will ask the Senator if he thinks the House can consider this concurrent
              resolution even if it is sent there?

            Mr. HANNA. I am the last man to be guilty of any discourtesy to any gentleman, but
              what cannot gentlemen do if they violate their faith with us? What can't they do?
              I conceive if they will be governed by parliamentary law, that it is beyond their
              reach till the 11th day of May. They have put it out of their power to consider the
              question till the 11th day of May; but they have the majority and they can take up
              what they please. We have got to take that risk. If the majority say they will thrust
              this down our throats, that agreement they made with us is violated.

            The Senator from Jefferson, [Mr. Cravens,] has said that we want to get this question
              before the people, and that he does not. Now I say the response which has been made by
              the people of Indiana as far as they have been consulted, has been to buoy up and
              strengthen the hands of those who appealed to the people for advisement upon this
              subject, and we are willing to stand there. But why force it upon us now? If I
              understand the late action of Congress, and the results that will probably follow,
              Indiana will not be called upon to act upon this amendment. You had better postpone
              this thing then as the House has done for thirty days, and let it go along, and before
              that time the action of Congress proposing to force upon the down trodden people of
              the south this Constitutional amendment, will become the law of the land. It appears
              to be a contest for the purpose of over reaching those Senators who in the simplicity
              of their hearts supposed that the honor of men might be trusted. Now the Senator from
              Jefferson [Mr. Cravens] alluded to a conversation between myself and himself last
              year. I would not allude to it if he had not. I went, in all good faith, to that
              Senator, and asked, there being a day fixed for the consideration of that question
              then, whether it would be brought up before that time. Two or three other Senators
              were in the room and they assured me it would not. We have been found fault with
              because we resigned before that hour arrived, but we did so simply because a member of
              the Republican caucus told me that the Senator from Jefferson and one other went into
              the caucus and urged them to take up that proposition next morning. The Senator from
              Jefferson, says he did not do any such thing, but I am only apprised of that since I
              came here-

            Mr. CRAVENS (interposing.) With the Senator's permission I will say that not
              only did I not urge it, but I asserted in the Republican caucus, as did the other
              Senator that if it was to be taken np before the time set we were in honor bound to
              give you timely notice. I appeal to Senators who were members of that caucus if this
              statement is not correct.

            Mr. HANNA. I say, acting upon information we received direct from a member of that
              caucus we made out our resignation before the hour for the consideration of the
              question. Now, acting upon that information we tendered them to the Governor. Now we
              have received assurances, verbal assurances from Senators sufficient to control this
              question if the stand by their assurances, that we shall have due notice. Now here is
              a joint resolution to ratify this Constitutional amendment, proposed by the Senator
              from Jefferson, and a concurrent resolution aecompanying it: and I say these Senators
              if that concurrent resolution is adopted the initiative and important step is taken
              towards the ratification of that amendment. These men have given us their
              assurances;-will they go back on them? I do not want to be deceived again in this
              thing. I want to act in good faith.

            I come here with an overwhelming majority of my people saying: stand aside when they
              propose to adopt that amendment. I would like to see that question laid before
              Republican counties, and if we don't get a majority their vote, I will say you
              may adopt it at any time. You say we have a compact minority but I disclaim that I am
              a leader of that minority. I am not. Whatever voice I may possess with that minority
              is simply on account of my personal and mental qualifications, whatever they are. But
              we have no leaders. We are all leaders. We act as the voice of the people of Indiana
              tells us how to act. These men have assured us that we shall have at least one
              day's notice; and if they intend to carry out that assurance now is the time to
              carry it out.

            Mr. ROBINSON, of Madison. I wish to say that the writing which was before yoor Caucus
              was withdrawn after you rejected it.

            Mr. HANNA. We never rejected it What is the verbal assertion of the Senator from
              Madison on that subject?

            Mr. ROBINSON, of Madison. I said as other Senators have, that before the
              consideration of this question should be brought up in the Senate, you should have one
              day's notice. If the Senator will convince me that the proposition before the
              Senate is in violation of good faith I will vote against it.

            Mr. HANNA. All I ask is one day's notice.

            Mr. SCOTT. I have said upon this floor; before this House was organized that before
              this question should be taken up I would voice to give them one, two, or five days
              notice; and I say now if the gentleman and his party, or those that are acting with
              him think that this is in violation of that understanding I am ready to vote to
              sustain that statement that made upon this floor.

            Mr. HANNA. I have already said that I believe it is the initiative and important step
                 in reference to it. I say if this concurrent
              resolution is adopted fixing the time, place and mode of ratification, and it is
              concurred in by the two Houses, and a majority of the two meet and ratify the
              amendment in accordance with the terms of the concurrent resolution the thing is gone.
              So does the Senator from Jefferson understand it; and so does the majority who are
              working for it understand it, or they would not stand-

            Mr CRAVENS, (interrupting.) I hope Senator does not design to misrepresent me. I said
              I had doubts upon it. I drafted the resolution with the full understanding that those
              who support it take the risks: and I think it the best mode for the reasons I have
              stated. No one believes or contends that the will be present in either branch or in it
              assembly when it meets.

            Mr HANNA. "Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof." We have not said
              that we will resign thirty days from now. I only say lift it is bad faith they intend
              to perpetrate on us. And to do that which will produce gratification in a form that is
              at least dangerous; I say that we are bound to stand here and take this step under the
              instructions we have received from this people that we were to oppose it in every
              form. As far as I concerned I will do so. I know a large majority of the people of
              Indiana are opposed to this thing. We are called the minority but we are placed in
              that peculiar position where the minority are representing a large portion if the
              people of the State, and those representing the minority of the people, are insisting
              n having their own way to the destruction of ordinary legislation.

            Why is it that this thing is thrust in here at me? Why is it, when the proclamation e
              Governor calling us together says that we are to consider the "necessary
              appropriations to carry on the State Government and et the current expenses of the
              Benevolent and other institutions of the State?" The appropriation bills are
              named in this proclamation, and why is it that this thing, outside of what is named in
              the proclamation of Governor, is the first thing thrust in upon and we are required to
              take it in this or leave our seats? Is this a people's government? Are the people
              to be heard here in reference to a radical change in the laws of a kind that gives a
              large increase of votes into the hands of a population that never heretofore exercised
              it? It concentrates in the general government what was never thought of in the
              adoption of the original Constitution of the United States. Yet the Senator from
              Jefferson s that he desires that the people shall not be consulted upon this subject.
              Now I say if we are going to change our form of government and give the people no
              voice in it, let us proclaim an Emperor. If the people are not to be heard when a
              large majority are represented by a minority here-their voice is not to be regarded
              and if a questionable majority of the hour, is to override all promises, and all
              pledges, what is there left of a people's government here?

            Now, Mr. President: a majority of the members on this floor can proceed with
              legislation or not as they see proper. I am not a leader but I speak for myself when I
              say they can go on or they can clog the wheels of legislation if they see proper. They
              can go on or they can stop legislation if they see proper.

            Mr. JOHNSON of Montgomery. I offer the following amendment:

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. Before the amendment is considered I would like to lay
              before the Senate a message received from the House, as it perhaps ought to be acted
              upon before the adjournment.

            The Secretary read the House concurrent resolution for a joint convention to secure
              the services of a minister of the Gospel to open the session in joint convention, this
              afternoon, with prayer.

            The resolution was concurred in.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR makes the committee on the part of the Senate to consist of
              Messrs. Hanna, Hamilton and Morgan.

            The Secretary read the resolution of the House inviting the Senate to a joint
              convention, at four o'clock, to receive the Governor's message.

            Mr. HANNA. I move to lay that on the table.

            Mr. CRAVENS. The Senator [Mr. Hanna] alluded to a ruling I made while in the Chair
              during a Joint Assembly last winter, as being-similar to that made by the Chair at the
              session in which Bright and Fitch were elected. The case was different. We have a Rule
              of the Senate which provides that in any Joint Convention of the two Houses, when the
              business for which they were specifically called together shall have been transacted,
              then the Convention shall adjourn. Upon that principle I ruled, in the case referred
              to, without any action of the body itself. Rule 55th of the Senate reads as
              follows:

            55. In all joint meetings of the two houses of the Legislature, convened for a
              specific purpose, it shall be incompetent for this body, or its members to engage in
              such joint meetings in the transaction of any other business than that for which they
              were so specially assembled.

            Mr. HANNA. What would be the ruling of the Chair on the subject of adjourning that
              convention to another day?

            Mr. CHURCH. I do not think the Chair called upon to determine a question which is to
              arise in the future.

            
            Mr. HANNA. I have great confidence-

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. The Chair would not hesitate to give a ruling when such a
              question may arise, I do not think that the Chair has any power over a joint
              convention.

            Mr. HANNA. Under that decision, I will not object to the resolution.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. Is there any objection to the consideration of the
              resolution?

            Mr. HANNA. I move to postpone its consideration till two o'clock.

             The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. If there is any objection, it cannot be taken up.

            Mr. JOHSON, of Montgomery's amendment was then read as follows:

            "Strike out all that refers to a concurrence of the two Houses, and strike out
              that part which refers to a joint convention of the two Houses,"

            Mr. BELLAMY. The amendment is out of order, because a motion of that kind has been
              voted down.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. It is slightly different, and the chair will rule it in
              order.

            Mr. JOHNSON, of Montgomery. Mr. President. My amendment will make the resolution
              simply one postponing the consideration of the amendment till the 11th of May. It
              strikes from the resolution all that part making a joint convention, which is
              something that never has been done. It is the first time in the history of the State
              of Indiana that there has been a resolution presented that would make a special order
              by a concurrence of the two Houses. It is a thing unprecedented and I hope the
              amendment will be agreed to and then the resolution be adopted so that we can go on
              with business.

            Mr. LASALLE. Mr. President, Gentlemen seem to have doubt as to the effect of this
              resolution. For my part I have not the least doubt but that if the Senate pass this
              resolution the House will pass it, at the day fixed, whether there be a quorum in
              either House or not; and that a joint convention raised in this way has the power to
              pass the resolution ratifying the Constitutional Amendment. Now nothing is more common
              than for some of our duties to continue after the session expires. After the two
              Houses pass this resolution it makes no difference what becomes of the quorum. The
              members composing that Joint Convention are authorized by us to carry out our
              resolution upon the well known principle: i facit per
                atium, facit per se: that which a person does by others, he does by
              himself. We consider them as our agent to carry out our resolution. Hence the
              importance of this proposition, and hence why i think it is deciding the question upon
              this subject. If we pass this resolution and the House should pass a similar
              resolution the thing is fixed, and whether there be a quorum or not that joint
              convention has full power and authority to carry out the resolution each House passed
              separately. Now in regard to the passage of a bill, that is different; but this is not
              a law. If it were a law we could not authorize any other body to enact it. The
              Constitution says that the taking effect of no law shall depend upon any other than
              legislative authority. But this will not be a law, for the Constitution says, all laws
              shall be by bill.

            It has been said by gentlemen on the opposite side, if we are sure that members of
              the House have pledged their honor as members that this matter should not be
              considered till the 11th of May, why have we any fears about the passage of this
              resolution. I will answer if they have confidence in the other House, why ask the
              passage of this resolution? To keep good faith with their friends in the other House.
              Why not pass a similar proposition? What harm can be done by it? The other House has
              passed a resolution postponing the consideration of the whole subject till the 11th
              day of May; Why caanot this House meet their friends in the other House on the same
              ground, if they were disposed to act in good faith? And why not carry out pledges made
              verbally? I simply ask, if the other body has done right, why not do as they have? And
              what harm can ensue if this body pass the same resolution as the other?

            Mr. CHURCH. Mr. President: I do not know what action I may be led to take; for the
              situation is truly alarming, When any question comes up here-a dog law, a road law, or
              a question of finance that a certain party that seems to be in the majority does not
              like, they get up and say: You shan't do it; we will resign and go home if you
              don't stop legislation right here; we will resign and you will be responsible for
              our going home; we know what your constituents want for we have been home to ours. I
              tell you sir, if I have got to this pass in Indiana, it is different from other States
              in the Union. If that is the proper course to be pursued in Indiana it is different
              from other States. But I do not believe it is proper in this State.

            The Senator from Sullivan [Mr. Hanna] states that the action of Congress has been
              such that within thirty days this will be the law without our action; and yet stands
              up so obstinate that notwithstanding that he would stop the legislation of this State
              rather than give up that will of his and his friends not to submi to the majority.
              Didn't he say so?

            Mr. MORGAN (iuterposing.) I would like to know how the Senator from Sullivan go
              here?

            Mr. CHURCH. I suppose he came on the cars. I don't know but that he insists upon
                 the old fashioned way of traveling-determined
              to be a Democrat as Democrats used to be - I don't know but that he came up on
              horseback; - I think it quite likely, as he has not changed his course, and probably
              still votes once in four years for General Jackson. Republicans come up on the cars,
              generally speaking.

             Mr. HANNA (in his seat.) On free tickets.

            Mr. CHURCH. Be that as it may; I will tell you how the Senator got here. I suppose he
              was occupying a seat here. I suppose he was occuplying a seat here, sworn faithfully
              to perform his duties as a Senator, but a question came up; he feared the majority
              might differ from him, and he resigned. Said he I won't perform; the duties which
              I have sworn to perform. I have come and agreed faithfully to perform my duties, but I
              am afraid to perform my duties, but I am afraid the majority will differ with me, and
              I won't perform any duties but will resign and go home. We know his people wanted
              him here, and thought it bad for him to go home. We thought he ought not to make them
              pay $1,000 to come back and we urged, plead and begged of him to remain, but he went.
              What was the result? We did not run anybody against him because we wanted - 

            Mr. GIFFORD (in his seat.) They run a nigger against me.

            Mr. CHURCH. If they would run a nigger against you in Porter County he would beat
              you. [Laughter.] I overheard a nigger just about such a man as the Senator from
              Evansville-say of me one day, "I'll be darned if I blame Church for being an
              abolitionist he is so near black himself;" and that may be one of the reasons why
              in my county they gave me about six hundred majority and in the county adjoining about
              the same.

            But in order to carry out the will of this minority, (because this will become a law
              in about thirty days, according to the Senator from Sullivan,) they say they will
              resign. And I say that is alarming. It is a precedent for minorities in all future
              time. Next year, if the Senator is right, the Republican party will to in the
              minority, and will they resign, upon every question of politics? There is a precedent
              here.

            With reference to this question of agreement: what was it? Will they pretend to say
              that these men agreed that they will not fix any time or manner in which this should
              be acted upon in the future ? I do not believe they promised to do anything more than
              to delay the time. These men think they see a Possibility that this Constitutional
              amendment may be ratified without their help. Dare they ask more than to say: We wash
              our hands of this iniquity; we are satisfied it is wrong; we will go out and leave
              you, gentlemen?

            Mr. HANNA (in his seat) That is what We propose to do.

            Mr. CHURCH. I give you distinctly to understand that I have been elected to carry out
              principles. I do not ask the Senator from Sullivan or the Senator from Franklin to
              undertake to tell me what my people want. Beleiving this I will do my duty, and if the
              Senator from Franklin wants to walk out he probably knows the way having so recently
              come in. I ask if we have not done our duty ? and if these men go out I ask if they
              have not as much interest in this State as we? I was in hopes the Senator from Laporte
              [Mr. Bradley] would withdraw his language : that if we act this way he has forever
              lost all confidence in the promises of the majority-

            Mr. BRADLEY (interposing.) I had no reference to the Senator from Porter [Mr.
              Church.] He made no pledge to me. I asked none.

            Mr. CHURCH. It is injustice to charge the rank and file of the Republican party with
              these things without naming the persons making the pledge, and the language in which
              their pledges were made. It is unjust to make the wholesale charge that they have all
              violated their pledges and obligations. If any person is to be charged with violating
              their pledges, the precise language should be stated, so that we can see and judge
              whether they are justifiable in the view they take.

            Mr. CRAVENS, (interposing.) I would ask if it would not be a more proper plan when
              the charge is made by Democratic Senators that this course is in violation of good
              faith entered into by Senators upon this floor, to let those Senators rise in their
              places and relieve Democratic Senators from the obligation not to reveal or announce
              themselves, and not throw the responsibility upon all the Republican Senators? If
              Senators have made pledges inconsistent with the course now pursued, I think it is
              unjust to them, and still more unjust to the men who have made obligations.

            Mr. CHURCH. This would be proper if these charges did not reflect upon all of us. The
              Senator from Laporte has relieved me. I think it unjust for a man to run until
              somebody is after him. But this charge falls equally upon Senator Jaquess as upon that
              Senator there, and upon Senator Johnston as upon the Senator from Vigo: and equally
              upon the whole of them because it is not charged what was said or who said it. I
              undertake to say, while there may be promises or statements out, it was not the
              intention of those parties to entrap Democrats without giving every opportunity they
              desired. While some Republican Senators may have stated, time and again, that they
              would not take up this resolution without giving the Democrats notice, they have not
              pledged themselves that no time should be fixed, or as to the certain  manner in which a time would be fixed. And I challenge a
              Senator to get up here and state if they have, and if so, who made them; and until
              they do I shall say they have no authority for making these charges, and that they are
              not true.

            Mr. GIFFORD. I do riot propose to name any names. It is a private matter until we are
              betrayed. We are not allowed to make public the names until we are betrayed. All we
              expect is for them to give us one day's time; and then if we stay here it will be
              our fault.

            Mr. CHURCH. I ask if any stronger pledges were given verbally than were given in
              writing by members of the Legislature.

            Mr. JOHNSTON, of Montgomery. I rise to a point of order.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. State your point of order.

            Mr. JOHNSTON, of Montgomery. The point of order is this: that the Senator has no
              right in any way to attempt to call out private pledges made between Senators.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR, The subject has been alluded to frequently by Senators in
              debate, and I presume it is right for the Senator to discuss it.

            Mr. JOHNSTON, of Montgomery. The Senator has no right to demand that any Senator
              should be required to reveal secrets.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. I do not think the point of order well taken. I think a
              Senator has the right to demand if he desires to, the demand to be complied with or
              not, as the other Senators please.

            Mr. CHURCH. If this matter is not to be talked about, I have nothing to say.

            Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President: Allow me to say that I used strong language about this
              matter. The pledge was this: or the assurances and statements upon which I relied, and
              influenced others to act upon were these : that the Constitutional Amendment should
              not be considered until a day certain; and before that day arrived we should have
              several days notice, one at least. Upon this I induced as far as I could others to
              come in, and I said if Senators persisted in the passage of this resolution I would be
              compelled to regard that as a violation of good faith.

            Mr. CHURCH. Then it is a question between the Senator and those others as to whether
              that was a contract and bargain or not. That is whether it included this further
              matter brought up to-day. I undertake to say that he is mistaken in believing that it
              includes the question raised here to-day. The Senator told me that question was one of
              post ponement-

            Mr. BRADLEY, (interrupting.) The Senator does not report correctly. I will say again
              that the question of this amendment should not be considered, understand me? 

            Mr. CHURCH. I understand he said two ways: before that resolution should be passed
              -

            Mr. BRADLEY, (interrupting.) No sir.

            Mr. CHURCH. He ways these parties agreed that we should not consider this question.
              Very well; we won't consider the question; but did they agree not to fix the
              time?

            Mr. BRADLEY. I made no objection to the time. I would vote for it, but not in the
              manner proposed.

            Mr. CHURCH. We are willing to fix more than the time. He don't say whether these
              parties agreed any thing with reference to whether the constitutional amendment should
              be considered in joint convention or separately in the two Houses. I think they would
              not and shall act upon it in that way; although it is not pleasant for me to be
              governed by a few persons that will make any kind of contract with Democrats. I am
              satisfied I never can deal with them without loosing. I am satisfied I never can
              bargain with them without getting the worst part of the bargain. Upon the question of
              ratification we have agreed to fix the time far in the future; but they are afraid we
              will leave it in such a position that the majority may act upon it; and they are not
              satisfied with getting out of the way themselves; but are not satisfied unless they
              take such action as will prevent the majority from doing anything. Enough for them is
              to get out of the way, I should think, and not stop to prevent our doing anything. Now
              I say I believe these men [Republicans] have not pledged themselves so far but what it
              is their duty, seeing the intention of these men to prevent legislation, to act like
              men; and I hope they will do it. And if these men desire to go before that time they
              will go. I hope today, (if they are afraid,) that they will go today. I thing this
              thing would be got along without them. I think we will run the nigger next time a
              little. I am disposed to stand firm; do nothing wrong, but do right.

            Mr. GRAY. I move that we adjourn.

            The motion was agreed to.

            And accordingly-

            The Senate took a recess till two o'clock p.m. 

            
              AFTERNOON SESSION.

              [Mr. STEIN'S Speech (which occurs here) on this question of the Order
                for the ration of the Fifteenth Amendment having been too long delayed for
                authentication, it found in this Appendix, page -.]

              

              Mr. HANNA. Mr. President: As I am one of those addressed in the letter called in
                question by the Senator from Tippecanoe, [Mr. Stein,] perhaps it is nothing but
                right and proper that I should give a correct version of that. And I would state now
                that at the adjournment of the last session, and after I had been informed of
                certain things to which the Senator from Jefferson [Mr. Cravens,] alluded, I failed
                to have that confidence in the word of man which I had before that time possessed. I
                am naturally of a confiding disposition, and when a man tells me a thing is so, or
                shall be so, and it is in his power to make it that way, I am inclined at all times
                to believe it. When a man deceives me once, it is my misfortune, but if he deceives
                me once, it is my misfortune, but if he deceives me a second time it is my fault.
                Therefore it may be for that reason that certain Senators are asked for no
                pledges.

              Mr. STEIN, (interposing.) I would ask that the Senator alludes to?

              Mr. HANNA. I allude to the running debate between the Senator from Jefferson, [Mr.
                Cravens,] and myself. I can only state-

              Mr. STEIN. Inasmuch as a remark was made by the Senator from Laporte, that I had
                not been asked for pledges, I should like to biow whether the remark affects me?

              Mr. HANNA. I will tell you. And I will state here, that I went to the Senators from
                Jefferson, [Mr. Cravens,] and Tippecanoe, [Mr. Stein,] and two or three other
                Senators on the Tuesday morning after this suffrage amendment came in on Monday, and
                I asked them if it was at all probable or likely that the amendment would be taken
                up or an hour fixed for its consideration. I was exceedingly anxious, as I am
                to-day, to do the necessary legislation for the State of Indiana. I applied to these
                Senators, who with two others I knew, would give the Democratic party the control of
                this Senate as to this question, and they gave me the assurance, as I understood it,
                that it should not be taken up without notice. Whether properly or improperly,
                whether rightful or wrongful, a member of the Republican party who attended their
                caucus that convened Tuesday night, came to me-

              Mr. CRAVENS, (in his seat.) Wednesday night.

              Mr. HANNA. No, Tuesday night, came to me and told me that the Senator from
                Jefferson, and the Senator from Tippecanoe after it was ascertained that a
                sufficient number could be commanded to ratify this amendment, they got up and
                advocateed and asked to bring the question upon us the next morning and put it
                through in violation-

              Mr. STEIN, (interrupting.) I desire to have the floor when the Senator gets through
                to make an explanation.

              Mr. HANNA. You can make it now.

              Mr. STEIN. The conversation alluded to was had in the room of the Senators from
                Jefferson, [Mr. Cravens,] and Wabash, [Mr. Fisher.] There was no one present except
                us four. It occurred on Tuesday morning before the opening of the morning
                session-the very morning succeeding the day upon which this amendment was
                communicated to us by the Governor. The first thing said to us by the Senator from
                Sullivan, [Mr. Hanna,] according to my recollection-of course I desire to put no
                wrong construction upon the Senator's own recollection-I presume he takes his
                and I take mine;but the first remark made by him was that he came to notify us that
                the Democratic Senators had their resignations ready and proposed to resign. I asked
                why, when we had postponed the consideration of the amendment till Thursday at two
                and a half o'clock? He answered that they could not rely upon that-that the
                Democrats were apprehensive that we were simply waiting to have our forces
                marshalled-there was a slim attendance Monday-and then that we would recind the
                special order and pass the amendment right through. We told him that was no purpose
                of ours, and if he desired proof of our sincerity that we would pledge our words
                that we would stand against any such thing. And he said if we would do that-knowing
                Judge Hughes' petition, it would be satisfactory. We gave him to understand
                that we spoke only for ourselves,' and if the caucus should come to a different
                conclusion we would give him due notice; add it will be remembered by the
                Republicans in that caucus, that we expressly informed our brethren in caucus, that
                if we came to the conclusion to take up the amendment we were in honor bound to the
                Senator from Sullivan, to notify him of our action. The President, [the Lieutenant
                Governor,] I believe was in the caucus, and will remember that notice. I have been
                resting under the recollection all along, definite and clear, that we were to notify
                him before any action should be had on the amendment provided our caucus concluded
                to take it up, so the Democrats should have time to resign.

              Mr. HANNA. I do not allude to this to get up a controversy. It is a matter of
                different recollection, as there always will be upon verbal arrangements. It has
                shaken, to a great extent my confidence in men, and until yesterday I had no
                information different from what I state now. Now, Mr. President, how have we
                proceeded since we came here? We made propositions, through the Senators and
                Representatives holding seats on the floor of the two Houses, to the opposition,
                upon what terms we would come in and proceed to the legislation which the Gouernor
                commanded us to come up here to do. This proposition was published the next morning,
                in the public prints. We had not expected that. How they got hold of it I do not
                know; certainly not through me, though I was the original draftsman of the proposition. We then made another proposition.
                That proposition was treated, as far as I know, with silent contempt. We never
                received any answer. I might say that the authority of the two Senators holding
                seats and the Representatives holding seats, to act for the whole party, having been
                questioned by the Republican caucus, we re-adopted the very same proposition and
                sent it back, but never received any answer to it. We submitted a fourth
                proposition; that we would come in and transact the business for which the Governor
                convened us-pass the appropriation bills and other necessary legislation-provided we
                have assurances that this proposition to amend the Constitution of the United States
                be postponed, and we have at least one days notice of its consideration. That was
                treated with silent contempt and no effort was made by them to get at legislation.
                Thereupon comes a proposition from members of the Republican party, acting not
                outside, but independently. Now the Senator from Tippecanoe, [Mr. Stein,] comes here
                and cracks his plantation whip over these Senators. He hopes none of them will bow
                the supple knee to-the people-the people. He is here cracking his whip-we will see
                whether they obey his behests or not.

              This proposition made by these several Representatives and Senators, whose names I
                do not mention except that of Mr. Osborn, whose name has been mentioned by the
                Senator from Tippecanoe, [Mr. Stein,] was not acted upon by the Democratic caucus-it
                was not in a form to require any action. But there was a committee appointed-my
                colleagues had the kindness to make me chairman, and I drew up a letter, which will
                in dne time be published, stating that if they would put this proposition in form it
                would be accepted. Then comes the reply of Mr. Osborn; and that reply says these
                promises had been repeatedly made. The very point in controversy had been repeatedly
                made, that letter says. What did we do with that letter? That letter came to me. I
                have known Mr. Osborn from his boyhood and I will say that he is an honorable man.
                The letter was received and thereupon the caucus adopted this resolution which I
                read as part of my remarks:

              RESOLVED, Thaathe House shall organize to-day, and immediately
                thereafter a resolution shall be introduced postponing the consideration of the
                fifteenth amendment until after the disposal of the necessary business of
                legislation. If said resolution is adopted, the Senate will then organize; but, if
                it is not adopted, the Senate will not organize, unless terms are obtained.

              Now sir, members of both Houses of the opposite party were informed of this
                resolution. Members of the Democratic party then went in, were sworn, the House was
                organized, and the resolution was passed unanimously men standing by their pledges
                in the House as gentlemen always should. Let weal or woe come a gentleman should
                stand by his word when he gives it. They stood by and adopted the resolution, and
                believing that the Senate would be equally honorable with the House we came in and
                were sworn in. Now we are met with a proposition, which they say is not the action
                of the Republican party, to entrap us. What does the letter say? That it was not the
                intention or purpose of the Republican party to entrap us. What does the Senator
                from Tippecanoe say? It is open war, war to the knife and to the hilt between a
                faction on one hand and the Republican party on the other. He asks no quarter and
                will give non. He will thrust this down the throats of the people, whether they
                desire it or not. No quarter, he says. Well, let him stand upon his platform and
                other gentlemen upon theirs and see whether he can crack his whip and stop them.

              Here is the resolution upon which we went into the two Houses, of which the
                gentleman was informed was the action of our caucus. We desire to take up the
                legislation of the State as the only business the Governor commanded us, and that is
                to pass the necessary appropriation bills. We desire to take them up and act upon
                them; and I would rather take them with all their defects and put them through, than
                stand here wrangling over the question whether the right of suffer-age shall be
                extended or not. I say the Republican party were informed of our resolution the
                democrats went into the House and the republican members in good faith carried it
                out. And we had the right to expect it would be carried out in the Senate. After
                what passed at the last session of the Legislature I exacted no personal pledges and
                I have given none. I know if a man were to give me a personal pledge and treat me in
                that kind of a manner it would be a personal matter between him and me, and we would
                settle it, if he placed me in a false position before the country and before my
                people.

              The Senator from Tippecanoe [Mr. Stein] says we must act upon this ; that it is a
                great reformation; that Christ himself had opposition raised to him, and objection
                must be expected to nigger voting. He makes that kind of blasphemous comparisons!
                [Laughter.] Now I say that my objection to extending the right of suffrage is not on
                account of the negro as a man, for I know nothing about him. I never was in a slave
                State in my life. I never had a negro about my house, and don't know anything
                about him. All I know of him is that history records the fact that from the earliest
                time of civilization to this, that you cannot make a government-that you cannot
                constitute a government, giving the power in the hands of two races, but you sow in
                that gov the seeds of its own destruction,
                Jealousies, discords of all kinds and bickerings will spring up which ultimately
                results in revolution and anarchy. Mexico is a good example. For forty years I
                believe every five years on an average they have been in revolution. Every man has
                equal privileges there and what a government they have got!

              I am not afraid, if you see fit to pass this Censtitutional amendment but what in
                ten yeary the majority of colored people would array themselves under the standard
                of the Democracy in voting. And why? (Laughter from the Republican benches.) Because
                the Democracy have been their friends. (Renewed laughter.) There never was four
                millions of black people, since the earliest period of civilization that were so
                well protected as these in the United States. Why did you ever know of the blacks in
                this country eating each other? and don't they do it in Africa? Didn't the
                Apostles visit that country when they visited the others, and yet they have never
                advanced a single step in civilization, in the arts or sciences, in commerce, or
                agriculture even, for three thousand years. Now, again, they would range themselves
                with Democrats because they are poor men and laborers. Politicians are dividing
                themselves in this country into the monied power and the power of labor - the power
                of wealth against the power of labor. And I think, naturally the poor men will range
                themselves on one side, and men controlled by wealth on the other. Of course some
                poor men will be on the side of the rich because they will hire them. They may do
                that for a time but they can't do it all the time They will get tired opening
                their purse strings. Therefore I say I am not afraid, as far as the success of the
                Democratic party is concerned I am not afraid of the adoption of the amendment. I
                oppose it on the ground that it is a concentration of power in the hands of the
                general Government, and is making a consolidated government, and not a confederate
                government. It is an attempt to revolutionize-a strike at the foundation of the
                principles of government as established by our fathers. And they are doing it in
                defiance of the people. And yet if these gentlemen think their constituents will
                sustain them, why are they afraid of submitting this question to the people?

              Now, all we ask, and earnestly insist upon, is that necessary legislation for the
                State shall be had before the question is taken up, discussed, or in any manner
                acted upon. This is another evidence of the sentiment getting abroad that the
                general government must control everything. All the necessary legislation for the
                support of the Asylums for the Blind, Deaf and Dumb and Insane, must wait for this.
                I have heard gentlemen here talking about the soldiers and say they will be the
                friend of their widows and orphans, and yet they stand here thrusting the nigger
                between the soldiers and the soldier's widow and children. They profess to be
                the friends extraordinary, not ordinary friends of the soldier, and the
                soldier's widows and orphans, and yet we see anothre evidence of the
                evershadwning demands of the general Government that the amendment to the
                Constitution shall take precedence of everything in the State. Now I hope the
                threats-if they may be called threats-this cracking of the plantation whip by the
                Senator from Tippecanoe [Mr. Stein]he is very fond of it for I have heard it often-I
                say I hope it will have no effect. And I tell the gentleman he had better look to
                his own position, for he stands upon slippery ground.

              I have a right to talk this way, for I have appealed to the people to know what
                they thought of my course here, and they sent me back. As far as that is concerned,
                however, I take my own course without consulting my constituency; and if it
                don't please them they can send somebody else. I think I have said all I desire
                to, unless some gentleman makes a statement connecting me with some transaction that
                may be necessary for me to explain.

              Mr. FISHER. Mr. President: It is not my purpose to enter into an argument upon this
                question. I came here with my mind made up as to the course I should pursue, and I
                was free to speak of it both to Republicans and Democrats. I said I was in favor of
                performing the necessary Legislation of the State, and when that was done take up
                this constitutional amendment. I was asked on last Friday, I think it was, if I
                would sign a paper to that effect. My reply was that I was never willing to give my
                word for anything that I was not willing to give my note for. I signed it, and that
                is the last I knew of the paper except what I have gathered from the discussion
                here. If the paper was withdrawn of course all obligations imposed by that paper
                were withdrawn with it. If I were to make you a proposition in writing, to buy a
                certain piece of property, and you had not accepted that proposition until 1
                withdrew it, the proposition would not be binding, and it is just precisely so in
                this case. Therefore whatever members of the Senate said prior to what was written
                on that paper and since, is the only thing they have to be governed by. No other
                pledges are resting, as I understand it, on any Senator here except such as have
                been verbally made. What I said verbally was not in the shape of a pledge to
                anybody;-it was a mere expression of determination of my own purpose-nothing more.
                Now how stands the proposition before us? Suppose that pledge was binding to give at
                least one days notice to the Democratic party before taking up and acting on that
                constitutional amendment? That joint resolution  ratifying the constitutional amendment was introduced to-day; and immediately a
                resolution was introduced postponing its consideration for four weeks. That is the
                question now before us, with the exception , of the amendment of the Senator from
                Montgomery [Mr. Johnston.] Now the question arises: Is that action upon the
                constitutional amendment?

              Mr. BRADLEY (interposing.) Why does not the Senator state the full purport of that
                resolution?

              Mr. FISHER. It having been read three or four times I did not think it necessary. I
                will state for the benefit of the Senator from Laporte, [Mr. Bradley,] for it is
                evedent he does not understand it, that it not only fixes the time and place but the
                manner of voting upon the fifteenth amendment. Well now sir, enact this resolution
                for postponement and what do you do? It would be understood by every Senator upon
                this floor to mean that in four weeks from to-day at two o'clock it would be
                taken up and acted upon in each House. I believe in the passage of that resolution,
                we are acting in perfect good faith to the gentlemen on the other side of the House.
                I suppose no Senator has pledged himself to let them dictate the terms of the
                resolution which should postpone action on this subject, but they seem to claim
                control of the whole matter.

              Now it was said this morning that if this resolution passed there would be
                resignations and a breaking up of the Legislature. Suppose we back down in view of
                that fact, the next thing would come in an appropriation bill which might contain an
                item obnoxious to the minority and they would say: strike that out or we resign.
                Then a bill might come in which was obnoxious to them and they would say: unless you
                indefinitely postpone it we will resign. And that principle clothes the minority
                with all the power of this body. It gives them power to control evrything, and hence
                I am unwilling to yield to their dictation in this matter.

              Much has been said about the people contending against a factious majority in this
                matter. I always imagined that I had a constituency and that I was representing
                them; and that is as much as I propose to do. I do not propose to submit to any
                other gentleman representing my constituency. When I come here I vote the will of
                the people who sent me here. I don't propose that any man shall say to me: Sir,
                you are voting against the will of your people and you must change.

              I regard it as a matter of no great consequence whether that amendment [Mr.
                Johnston's] is adopted or not. As far as I am concerned if the amendment is
                voted down and the resolution of postponement passed, and a majority of the members
                of each House vote in favor of adopting the joint resolution it be so admitted and
                so adjudged. I believe that if a majority of the members of the Legislature go into
                joint session and by a majority of each House vote in favor of that amendment, that
                will be sufficient. What is needed is a majority of the Legislature. If a minority
                prevent our doing it in a legimate way, let the majority do it in the best way they
                can, so as to give an expression tot he Executive of the United States, of the
                wishes of the majority of the people of Indiana. This fifteenth amendment has to be
                ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the States. What we want to show
                is, that by a vote of a majority of each branch the Indiana Legislature is in favor
                of it, and I apprehend it makes little difference whether there is fifteen twenty to
                vote in the negative or none. I believe it will be just as effectual as if the
                Democratic party were here.

              Mr. CARSON (interrupting.) Then why was it not gratified last session? And why was
                it not ratified before we organized this session?

              Mr. FISHER. In reply I will say that the only reason was, we had not sufficiently
                matured the subject. [Laughter.] It Wag something new. We were not so well satisfied
                upon the subject as we are now. We had not inquired into the legality of such a step
                And there may be a difference of opinion now. I am only giving my opinion.

              Now I said last week that if a proposition was sprung for the purpose of ratifying
                the constitutional amendment I would vote in favor of postponing it to a certain
                time, and I am ready to vote for that resolution of postponement. When that vote
                comes I want the yeas and nays, for there may be half a dozen members who have made
                pledges and I want to see their names. If the Democrats join with such Republicans
                as favor the fifteenth amendment and vote down the resolution for postponement, the
                responsibility is with them; and in voting that down it brings us to a direct vote
                upon the constitutional amendment and then the responsibility is with them.

              Mr. RICE (interposing.) I understand the pending proposition is the amendment of
                the Senator from 'Montgomery. Do I understand that you will vote
                "aye" on that proposition?

              Mr. FISHER. No sir. I was supposing that we were going to vote upon the resolution
                just as introduced, then I would like to know whether the Democratic Senators are
                going to vote with those who are now in favor of pressing that resolution for
                ratification at once, and thus defeat those who are ready to vote to postpone it or
                not? If they do this and a vote on the question is brought up the responsibility is
                with them. I will endeavor to have it postponed, but if it comes I will be found
                voting "aye." 

              

              Mr. BRADLEY. I will ask, for he is one of the Senators upon whom I relied, not upon
                a written pledge, but upon verbal statements, whether he did not tell me that he
                would be in favor of postponing the consideration of this fifteenth amendment till
                after all legislation is done; and particularly as to whether I did not ask him-if
                they intended to take any step to get us into any kind of a trap - whether the
                legislative journals should show the facts in the case - and whether he did not say
                there was no trap contemplated and that they would make the journals show the facts?
                And when I asked if he thought the Governor would certify to the facts, if he did
                not say that the Governor would certify to the facts, and everything should be done
                fairly and openly?

              Mr. FISHER. To all that I answer affirmatively; stating however, in teh same
                connection, that I gave my own views and my own action, and not authoritatively what
                would be the action of any one else. For instance, speaking of the Governor's
                action, I had no authority to say what he would sign, nor did I say as knowing, but
                simply as a matter of opinion. And in that position I now stand. I am ready to
                postpone the consideration of that joint resolution four week, and I propose to vote
                for that measure. There is no trap in it. I do not so understand it.

              Mr. BRADLEY. I will ask further, if the Senator intimated by word, gesture or
                action, or anything, that coupled with that, should be this proposition to consider
                the fifteenth amendment in Joint Convention?

              Mr. FISHER. I never thought of such a thing. It never crept into my head, This is
                something new to me. But it comes here and I meet it; and it amounts to nothing
                material in my judgment. But I have said enough on that. Something has been said in
                relation to certain pledges that were made in a conversation between the Senators
                from Sullivan, [Mr. Hanna,] Jefferson, [Mr. Cravens,] Tippecanoe, [Mr. Stein,] and
                myself. My understanding is as was stated very clearly by the Senator from
                Tippecanoe. When the Senator from Sullivan, had spoken of the question precisely as
                the Senator from Tippecanoe stated, it was said, as we are very apt to say, that a
                thing should not or would not be taken up, as I said to the Senator from Laporte,
                [Mr. Bradley,] that there would be no traps and that our journals should all show
                right,meaning that was my purpose, that it should. But we stated at the same time
                that it would be controlled by the Republican caucus, and if any other course was
                decided on he should be immediately notified. In addition to this I said I would
                vote against, taking it up before 2 1/2 o'clock. I don't think either of
                the other Senators went so far as that, but I did. With regard to what transpired in
                the caucus I will only say that a motion was made that we take it up at 2 1/2
                o'clock on Wednesday. I think it was immediately withdrawn; or after a very
                short discussion. I am not certain whether it was withdrawn or voted down. There was
                no proposition to take it up Wednesday morning. It was averred by the Senators from
                Tippecanoe and Jefferson that they should feel constrained to notify the Senator
                from Sullivan immediately if it was agreed to take it up. Another great error the
                Senator from Sullivan made. He said after it was found that we could pass the
                ratification-I say to you we never found that--

              Mr. HANNA (interrupting.) I was only giving the language of my informant.

              Mr. FISHER. On that night the highest vote was twenty-three Senators-so the whole
                thing originated in a mistake, or error, or misinformation.

              Mr. HANNA. Was it full?

              Mr. FISHER. Yes sir, it was full, excepting one man only-Mr. Colley.

              Mr. HANNA. Are you sure of that?

              Mr. FISHER. Yes sir.

              Mr. HANNA. Was Mr. Hughes there?

              Mr. FISHER. Yes sir, Mr. Hughes was there. There were twenty-nine in the caucus,
                and twenty-three only pledged themselves to vote for the amendment. I believe I have
                said all that is necessary to say on that subject. This'question has been
                argued by gentlemen more competent than I am. I felt constrained to define the
                position in which I stood because I supposed in all these references to pledges
                reference was had to me as one of them. I now stand with a determination if
                possible, to pass this matter over for the term of four weeks. I am in favor of that
                resolution; but while I am in favor of that, I am not in favor of the Democratic
                members dictating the terms of any resolution we pass.

              Mr. BRADLEY. Suppose the resolution should pass and be concurred in by the House,
                would it not take it out of the power of this Senateto alter it without the
                concurring action of the House?

              Mr. FISHER. I suppose it would. I have no question of that. That matter must then
                come up on that very day at that very hour. If the Democratic members should be here
                with us, or we be here and they see proper not to act with us, I apprehend it would
                not make one cent's difference whether we go by resolution of the House and
                Senate together or by resolution of a joint caucus.

              Mr. BRADLEY. I will ask if the Senator is indifferent whether this is passed
                now-about going into joint convention under this vote, or by the two Houses
                separately,-why does the Senator insist that this resolution should be adopted?

              Mr. FISHER. In reply I have this to say:  that
                when this resolution came in it was said by Democratic Senators that if you pass
                that resolution we will resign. That is just the point. If we are upon every
                immaterial question to be threatened with a resignation to break up the Legislature
                it is just as well to stop to-day as any other time. If this was a question of the
                passage of the Constitutional amendment, it would be a different thing. But I hold
                it to be an immaterial question, and if so let the resignations come.

              Mr. GRAY. Mr. President: I had not intended to say anything with regard to this
                question, and should not now were it not for the fact that a great deal has been
                said with regard to certain pledges: and I do not know but perhaps the vote, when
                that is taken, will be considered as pointing out the Republican Senators who may
                have made certain pledges to our Democratic brethren. Now I have made no pledges at
                all. I have refused to sign anything of the kind. I am clear and untrammelled, but I
                am not willing, nor am I going to discuss the matter of pledges in the Senate. It is
                a matter between individual members and Democrats, and a question I have no right to
                inquire into. I am going to vote upon this matter just as I feel upon it as an
                individual Republican Senator. For my part if a caucus had determined to take up
                this question, at a certain day I would have stood by that caucus election, but my
                party has not determined anything of the kind: then I am left free to act and vote
                as becomes an individual Senator in his place, and I shall do so.

              I think I can say, and say truly, that a large majority of Senators in this
                chamber, both Democrats and Republicans, have been saying in the hotels, upon the
                street corners, in the chamber here, and almost everywhere else, that they were in
                favor of acting upon the necessary legislation of the State before taking up this
                amendment to the organic act of the nation. I have so expressed myself, and am going
                to act in that way. I am for the fifteenth article. I am as much in favor of it as
                any gentleman, and represent one of the most radical constituencies in the State of
                Indiana; and that is saying a good deal, but I do not believe that any Senator can
                go before his constituents and receive any applause after having been very
                punctillious on this question as to the matter of time. All that can be done to-day,
                an be done next week or the week after; and I am solicitous about a few measures
                before this Legislature. I am exceedingly anxious that this election bill shall
                pass; and that the fee and salary bill should pass; and I am exceedingly anxious
                with regard to one or two other propositions; and I shall shape my conduct and vote
                so as to bring about the passage of these measures that I believe the people are
                interested in. After we get through then I am willing to take up this constitutional
                amendment and vote upon it whether we have a quorum or not. 

              Mr. CHURCH. I will ask the Senator if he has not assurances that the presiding
                officer will not entertain a resolution when there is no quorum present;every
                Senator knows that the presiding officer refuses to entertain a resolution when
                there is no quorum here- and now, if the Senator is so anxious about th ratification
                of this amendment, I ask how he expects to do it until he votes upon it? 

              Mr. GRAY. I have not understood the chair as expressing himself in that way. The
                Senator from Porter [Mr. Church] may hay information that I have not.

              Mr. CHURCH. I do not think there has been any secret about it. During five or six
                days the President has uniformly refused to entertain resolutions in the absence of
                a quorum unless they have direct reference to the perfection of the organization of
                the Senate And it was so at the last session.

              Mr. GRAY. I do not remember it. I was not here the last two or three days of last
                session. But suppose you insist upon the passage of the resolution you have now, and
                suppose the Democratic Senators go out and resign how will you do ?

              Mr. CHURCH. I propose to have another election and another session. I propose that
                when men undertake to be ugly they can't he worse than I.

              Mr. GRAY. The only difference between the two positions is this: In the course I
                shall take, although this state of things may come about, still the necessary
                legislation of the State will have been enacted; his course will bring about the
                same state of facts but the necessary legislation will not be enacted. I simply
                wanted to make this explanation for the purpose of explaining my vote when I come to
                give it.

              Mr. RICE. Mr. President: I will take this opportunity to place myself right upon
                the record on the vote which is to come up. This is the same vote we took this
                morning, substantially. It is varied a little, and comes back in a little different
                shape. The question was new to me. I tried to get information as to the scope of
                this resolution on yesterday, but could not do it. This morning the question came
                up. Without having time to investigate or think about this thing, I voted against
                the amendment. I shall vote in favor of the amendment, now, and simply for this
                reason: I stated in the Senate the other day-it has been my view before I left home,
                since I came here, and is yet-that the necesary legislasion ought to be gone through
                with. The people ask it and demand it. I am with the Senator from Randolph [Mr.
                Gray]: there is legislation pending which nearly and dearly affects the  interests of my constituents, and I want to go on with
                that legislation. When we get through with that, I then propose to cast my vote to
                take up this amendment, and vote for the amendment and dodge no responsibility.

              But how are we placed? When we came back we found the Senators who had resigned
                with credentials in their pockets. They stood out from Thursday afternoton at two
                o'clock, till yesterday at four. At that time there was a prospect of the
                Legislature breaking up, and, I say it here fearlessly, it was the understanding -
                and men who say they never bow the supple knee and cringe to power were as anxious,
                that I, or any person else should make a pledge. They would not do it themselves,
                however glad they would be for me to do it. It was the feeling of every Republican
                Senator before the organization; and now, after these pledges are given - I did not
                give any absolute pledge, and I do not think any Democrat will say that I did, but
                if it had been necessary, had I been asked to pledge, I should have done it. I spoke
                to the Senator from Porter and the Senator from Laporte, and stated this position. I
                thought the amendment ought to be pushed off to a certain day, or indefinitely,
                until the neccessary legislation was passed, and then taken up.

              Mr. CHURCH, interposing. I undertake to say that when you state that every
                Republican member intimated to you that they would like you to make these statements
                to Democrats, it is not true so far as I am concerned.

              Mr. RICE. You cannot get up a quarrel with me. I will make an exception of the
                Senator from Porter [Mr. Church,] if he disclaims anything of the conditions.

              Mr. GREEN. Will the Senator please except me ?

              Mr. RICE. Yes sir; but I will not except any more of you. [Laughter.]

              Mr. KINLEY. The Senator from Wayne [Mr. Kinley] must be excepted.

              Mr. RICE. No, sir. I say, as a general proposition, not that I spoke to every
                Senator, but you could feel it in the atmosphere of the Republicans with whom you
                talked. And, I say the Republican pulse beat high all over the State for it. And, on
                this Senate floor men went further than I-they signed a paper. I don't blame
                them for that. I thought they did right if they could reconcile it to their sense of
                propriety. But how has it resulted? That the Democracy relying upon these indefinite
                pledges-these street talks that we had as among gentlemen, and the written pledge of
                seventeen members of the Legislature, they came in; and I say they have a right to
                say it.

              What was the effect of my speech the other afternoon? I know it had a damaging
                effect on me with some of my friends. But it brought several Senators to their feet
                who indorse the same position I took. Mr. Scott interrupted me at the time.

              He read from the published reports as follows :

              
                Mr. SCOTT (interrupting-) Do you say they had pledges from enough to control the
                  action of the legislature?
                Mr. RICE. I so understand it. I say you stand upon dignity-
                Mr. SCOTT (interrupting.) I have given an individual statement, and if they are
                  not willing to take my word as a man of honor-
                Mr. RICE. What individual statement?
                Mr. SCOTT. I am willing to give these gentlemen all the time they want to get
                  out, if they want to leave-if it is one, two or five days.
                Mr. RICE. That is my very proposition,-and I want the Senate to make it here.
                  And, this afternoon we will have a Senate.
              

              Mr. Fisher interrupted me in the same way. I indorse the whole thing as my course.
                Now, how does this thing stand? After the proposition had been sent to the
                Democratic caucus, it was withdrawn, and the Chairman, Mr. Osborn, returned to the
                Democratic caucus a letter, in a part of which he says:

              
                And while they desire and seek nothing but a fair and undisguised course in any
                  act of legislation, they can see no good that will result from any additional
                  promises.
              

              What is the effect of that? You have got our promises already. But if you ask us to
                go one step further, we give no additional promises. The paper was withdrawn. But
                that shows that the substance was before the Democratic caucus; and they say upon
                that they acted.

              Mr. GIFFORD, (in his seat.) That is the way we understood it.

              Mr. RICE. Then you have organized upon what was said on the street, and they said
                they would not give any additional pledges; and so the inference is that the pledges
                were binding in effect. They so organized and agreed upon a line of policy. They
                agreed to organize the House, and the Senate was not to be organized until a
                resolution was there passed to postpone this amendment. The representative from
                Porter county introduced the resolution postponing it till the 11th day of May. That
                has been my position all the time, and men shall not come upon this floor and tell
                me that I bow the suppliant knee, and cringe to power, when, at the same time, they
                depend upon my pledge, and your pledge, and for the purpose of an organization, use
                us as a cat's paw to put these chestnuts in the Senate, and then face upon us.
                The crack of the lash will have to come from other hands on my back before it will
                be felt. It will have to come from hands clean and pure as to having stood by the
                organization of the Republican party during the last session. [Applause.]

              Now, sir, what do they propose? The Senator from W'abash says that in fact the
                  resolutions are the same, and we can organize
                and pass the constitutional amendment, and pass it with the Democracy outside, and
                it will be equally binding with a joint convention. I say no. I say no! Does it
                carry out the assurances of Mr. Osborn that they desire "nothing but a fair and
                undisguised course in any act of the Legislature?" Then why does the Senator
                hold on to the propositions, the result of which is equally the same? Why do we
                spend so much time when there is not a Republican who comes out and says that the
                action proposed is in a straightforward and undisguised course; and was not so
                intended? I say if the Democrats sit quiety by here and in the House, and let it
                pass, they organize a joint convention with the majority, and that convention rules
                without respect to them. I go in for taking a square course. When I pledge my word
                as a Republican, I intend, as far as my action is concerned, that it shall stand. It
                shall stand let other Republicans do as they please. I consider myself bound, and I
                have now achieved the purpose for which I made the statement, and that is the
                orgaization of the Legislature.

              Mr. TURNER. Will the Senator allow me?

              Mr. RICE. Certainly.

              Mr. TURNER. In this informal conversation of his upon the streets, I will ask him
                if he does riot now understand and believe that the real basis and foundation, upon
                the part of the Democrats, and the inception of their willingness to come in and be
                qualified began with the debate which took place upon the pledges or remarks that
                they would--?

              Mr. RICE. I should judge they had their force. They would have had their effect
                upon me had I been in the position those gentlemen were.

              Mr. TURNER. I ask this question for the simple reason that the next day, the first
                time I saw the Senator after he made his speech seeing that he and others would
                agree to postpone this question-he and myself had a conversation, and I think in
                that conversation I stated that it was an expression of confidence we had not
                before--

              Mr. RICE. I know that at no time did I utter any other sentiment than the one I
                uttered on this floor. What effect it had upon the Senator and others I do not
                know.

              I do not want to prolong this discussion any further. I see a material difference
                in the two propositions. I am willing, for one, if they resign to-morrow, to take up
                the constitutional amendment, and vote on it, and let our action go as far as it
                may. But I shall not discuss the proposition-it is not before us.

              It is a simple question of right or wronga question of justice to the people of
                Indiana. Your State officers are borrowing money to carry on the institutions with;
                every interest of the State is languishing, and we are standing on a point which
                ought not to block legislation at this time. If these gentlemen had stood aside, and
                we had passed this resolution today, I think it would be perfectly legal, and it
                would be legal at any time. What is the effect of it? You virtually effect the
                passage of the constitutional amendment today, because it gives you a power to
                exercise at a future day, which if a sufficient number live and are able to and are
                able to get here, they can exercise, and they will. I stand upon what I have said -
                upon the pledge of the seventeen members of teh Legislature - upon the pledge of the
                vote of the solid House yesterday in regard to my course, and I am here to vote in
                good faith to carry out the line of policy indicated on Saturday and indorsed by the
                House of Representatives.

              Mr. JOHNSON of Montgomery. In order that we may get at legislation; and take up
                such bills as are necessary to be acted upon, I move that this resolution and
                pending amendment be postponed and be made the special order for Monday the third
                day of May next.

              Mr. RICE. Why say the third? Put it on the eleventh.

              Mr. JOHNSTON, of Montgomery. I will say the eleventh then.

              Mr. CRAVENS. Mr. President. I suppose we apprehend fully the meaning of the
                gentleman's motion. I have nothing to disguise. These resolutions have been
                pretty generally debated and fully discussed, during which something has been said
                about pledges. I do not believe any Senator upon this floor is here upon the
                influence of a pledge since the withdrawal of the written pledge. Senators have
                risen and said they made no such pledges as are imputed. They expressed their own
                individual opinion. The opinion expressed by the Senator from Parke I had at all
                times, arid would have expressed it had I been disposed to give assurances. There
                has been no time since the amendment came in here that I would not have subordinated
                its consideration aud passage to the perfection and passage of all internal, local,
                state and home legislation. Now sir, Senators have said they are extremely desirous
                to refer this question to the people. I ask Senators where do we get our power to
                refer questions to the people? We have come here under the command of the people and
                the constitution of the United States and of this State--

               Mr. CARSON, (interposing.) This is a proposition to amend the fundamental law of
                the land.

              Mr. CRAVENS. Exactly. I prefer not to be interrupted. It is a bad habit growing up
                on this floor. Let Senators make a mend  of it.
                I do not intend any discourtesy. I want to be brief- I am going to bring this matter
                to a close to a determinaton before I leave it. 

              When Senators talk about referring this to the people I say if they are true to the
                Constitution they are insincere, because these people have said, Here is our will;
                here is the organic law. What does that tell you to do? It says that whenever the
                Constitution of the United States is to be amended it shall be done by a vote of two
                thirds of the States. Now what shall be done with it? The people made that
                Constitution; it is their will - their command to you and to me; and we have sworn
                to obey it. It says that Congress shall determine whether the voice of the people
                shall be called or whether this Constitutional amendment shall be referred directly
                to the people's representatives or agents in the several Legislatures. I say
                there have been fourteen amendments to the Constitution of the United States and
                every single one of them have been made in the very mode proposed now to adopt this
                fifteenth Constitutional amendment. I say that when the Democratic party or the
                Republican party propose to light this thing of negro suffrage they have chosen a
                bad place to fight it. If they had been in good faith and determined to fight this
                suffrage question they should have done it when they permitted the negro to be made
                a citizen, because now if you can withhold suffrage from any class of citizens, have
                you not the same power to rob and take from other classes the elective franchize?
                Certainly the same power will fully authorize you to take it from any other
                class.

              As to the mode I will be frank. There is no other Senator upon this floor
                responsible for this resolution introduced this morning. The main thing in it is
                what? The very thing these Senators have been asking day after day for a
                postponement of the consideration of this question. I now ask the Secretary to read
                the concurrent resolution, which followed the introduction of the joint rresolution,
                and I call the attention of the Senate to the language of it.

              The Secretary read as follows:

              Resolved by the Senate, the House of Representatives concurring, That the
                consideration of the joint resolution accepting and ratifying, on the part of
                Indiana, the proposed Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States,
                be postponed and made the special order for action at 2 o'clock P. M. on Tuesday, the eleventh day of May next ensuing, in joint Assembly of
                the two Houses to be held in the Hall of the House of Representatives on said day
                and at said hour.

              Mr. HAMILTON. Will the Senator yield?

              Mr. CRAVENS. I want to get clear of this, so that you can do what you want to. This
                resolution proposes to postpone the consideration of that joint resolution. I
                supposed this proposition to make it a special order would be voted tor directly,
                and I supposed some of my own party would have to vote for it. It was introduced for
                this simple reason,-and I will be as frank as gentlemen dare be;-there was only one
                poor, pittiful, lame advantage, and that was that we would have the benefit of these
                Democrats in each end of this Capitol to legalize the joint assembly, and for
                nothing else. I do not know--

              Mr. BRADLEY (interposing.) Will the Senator tell us that he did not deny that this
                morning?

              Mr. CRAVENS. No sir;-I do not know whether the Reporter took it or not;-I said the
                main proposition was the question of postponement; and another thing, the other
                proposition was to get it from before both of these bodies, so it would not be a
                temptation to the majority, nor a terror to the minority without let or hindrance. I
                say all the advantage was simply legalizing the joint Assembly. I recollect in
                caucus, I proposed myself that mode of ratifying that Constitutional amendment, and
                I know it was most promptly and decidedly voted down by a caucus of my own political
                party. I say we are taking all the chances of the legality of that mode;-and even
                more risk upon ourselves than they, We are taking the risk of again presenting the
                proposition to the same body of men who upon a former occasion refused to adopt
                it.

              The Senator from Sullivan, [Mr. Hanna,] in his speech this morning, took issue with
                myself. I understood him to say that mode would not be legal. I said no other man
                was responsible for this. I regret now that it had not been made the subject matter
                of a caucus; and when I find members of my own party reject a proposition of this
                sort, I certainly have no right to persist in trying to force it to a vote; and I do
                not feel that I am authorized individually, in my own person, to assume the
                responsibility of even one day's delay of the necessary legislation of the
                State by my own individual action. But, as I was alone responsible for this
                proposition; and as I find members of my own party are not in favor of it, many of
                them;-I know it will look a little harsh to others that I pursue this course, I now
                propose;-and inasmuch as this debate has gone as far, perhaps, as practicable; and
                inasmuch Mr. President, as I won't reply to this cracking whip operation; when
                I see the effect of those threats, and see the disposition to yield to them that I
                have seen around me today; I do not feel that I would be authorized to answer the
                responsibility of delaying legislation, continuing acrimonious debate, or further
                disturbing the harmony of this body, I now, if the Senator from Montgomery will
                withdraw his amendment and motion to postpone, I will put an end to the matter.

              Mr. JOHNSTON of Montgomery. I would like to know what kind of an end? [Laughter.] 

              

              Mr. CRAVENS. I will say to the Senator that I will put an end to it that will be
                satisfactory to him.

              Mr. BRADLEY. Let us hear what it is? Will it be a call for the previous
                question?

              Mr. CRAVENS. I shall not call the previous question. I have already indicated what
                it would be, and have no disposition to go back on what I have said.

              Mr. HANNA. We don't want this matter laid upon the table.

              Mr. CRAVENS. It will not be laid upon the table.

              Mr. JOHNSTON of Montgomery. If the Senator will withdraw his resolutions joint and
                concurrent, I have no objection.

              Mr. CRAVENS. I have indicated clearly, I apprehend to every man within the sound of
                my voice what I propose to do.

              Mr. JOHNSTON of Montgomery. With the understanding that I have the previlege of the
                floor to press the same amendment, if it is not satisfactory, I will withdraw
                it.

              Mr. CRAVENS. I go into no understanding.

              The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. Does the Senator from Montgomery withdraw the motion to
                postpone?

              Mr. JOHNSTON of Montgomery. Yes, sir.

              Mr. CRAVENS. Then with the consent of the Senate, in order to put the matter at
                rest, and leave the whole matter and the whole responsibility in the hands of the
                majority, for them to take whatever course they see fit, I ask permission to
                withdraw both the joint resolution and the concurrent resolution.

              The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. Is there any objection? The chair hears no objection. It
                is so ordered. The Chair lays before the Senate House.

              The Secretary read an invitation for the Senate to attend in joint convention, at
                four o'clock, in the hall of the House to hear the Governor's message.The
                invitation was accepted.

              Mr. HANNA. I do not want to go over this discussion again at some future time, and
                I have a resolution on this subjeet which I desire to offer now.

              It was read as follows:

               RESOLVED. That the consideration and discussion in every shape
                and form, of the proposed Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United
                States, and every preliminary resolution, or motion looking to the consideration of
                the ratification of said amendment, shall be, and hereby is postponed till the 11th
                day of May next, at 2 o'clock in the afternoon of said day; to the end that the
                necessary appropriation bills, and other necesssary legislation may be acted
                upon.

              Mr. HANNA. I call the yeas and nays and move the previous question.

              The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. It is the opinion of the Chair that this resolution is not
                in order for the reason that the Senate has concurred in a resolution of the House
                to a, into the Hall of the House to hear a message from the Governor.

              Mr. HANNA. Has the hour arrived?

              The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. Yes sir.

              Mr. HANNA. I did not know that. I withdraw the resolution.

              Thereupon-

              The hour having arrived and passed, Senators repaired to the Hall of the House
                instanter.

              When they returned-

              On motion by Mr. STEIN, the Senate adjourned till two o'clock P.
                  M., tomorrow. 

            
            

          
          

          

          

            SUPPLEMENTARY TO THE BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
              VOLUME ELEVENTH.
            Proposed Amendments to the Constitution of the United  States
              ----The Fifteenth Article---- Debate in Continuation.
            IN SENATE.

              AFTERNOON SESSION.
              [IN CONTINUATION-p. 286.]

              The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR called to order at two o'clock p. m., and stated the
                order to be the resolution, submitted by Mr. Cravens this morning, the consideration
                of which was pending at the time of taking the recess for dinner.

              The resolutions are as follows:

              
                
                  
                    A JOINT RESOLUTION Accepting and Ratifying a certain Amendment to the
                      Constitution of the United States.

                    WHEREAS, Congress has, by a two-thirds vote, proposed to
                      the Legislatures of the several States in Amendment to the Constitution of the
                      United Sates, which, when ratified by the Legislatures of three-fourths of the
                      States, shall be valid, to all intents and purposes, as a Part of this
                      Constitution, namely; 

                    
                      
                        
                          "ARTICLE XV.

                          "SECTION 1. The right of the Citizens of the
                            United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United
                            States, nor by any State, on account of race, color or previous
                            condition of servitude.

                          "SEC. 2. The Congress shall have power to

                    Be it Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of Indiana, That said
                      Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States is hereby
                      Accepted and Ratified on the part of the State of Indiana:

                    Resolved by the Senate, the House of Representatives concurring, That the
                      consideration of the joint resolution accepting, and ratifying, on the part of
                      Indiana, the proposed Fifteenth Amendment to the institution of the United
                      States, be postponed and made the special order for action at two
                      o'clock, P. M. on Wednesday the eleventh day of May
                      next ensuing, in joint Assembly of the two Houses to be held in the Hall of
                      the House of Representatives on said day and at said hour.
                  
                  
                
              

              The quention being on Mr. Johnston of Montgomery's amendment as follows:

              Strike out all that refers to a concurrence of the two Houses, and strike out that
                part which refers to a joint convention of the two Houses.

              Mr. STEIN. Mr. President: I announce myself as one determined to support the
                resolutions of the Senator from Jefferson [Mr. Cravens.] Since they have been sprung
                in this chamber, they have been vehemently assailed by the opposition as involving a
                breach of faith on the part of the Republican members of the Legislature. It has
                been charged that our Democratic brethren have been cajoled into a reappearance
                among us, by pledges which are now sought to be broken. This is a grave charge;
                involving a question of honor. I presume, I for one, may speak upon it without
                embarrssment. I assume that it will not be urged against me, that I am committed to
                any pledge, direct or indirect; or that any act of mine has tended to deceive my
                democratic colleagues with regard to my ultimate purpose.

              Now, sir, with my understanding of the case I cannot but regard all this clamor
                concerning a breach of faith as unfounded and a perversion of the facts. Hence I am
                unwilling that the charge should go abroad uncontradicted. Already it is exultantly
                paraded in Democratic prints that we of the Republican party have bowed the knee to
                the arrogant dictation which has been made for the last six days, that our political
                adversaries held us bravely at bay, until our own fears led us to succumb and yield;
                after which they graciously came  back among
                us. This is a version both pleasing to the Democratic ear and flattering to
                Democratic pride. But unfortunately it lacks the foundation of truth.

              When this session began, our colleagues of the opposition were in this city in
                close cabal and conspiracy, determined to deny their presence to the legislature
                until we of the Republican party, should secure them against the intrusion of the
                Fifteenth amendment, at any time during the session by firm and unequivocal pledges.
                We were given to understand in a variety of ways that this was a condition absolute;
                without which we should, under no circumstances, enjoy their companionship aud aid
                in the work of legislation. We were served with notice as early as our first
                preliminary caucus - hold last Wednesday evening; the day before the meeting of the
                present General Assemply. Did we quail? did we yield then? What was our action on
                the demand? We laid it on the table, coupled with a resolution which, in the most
                authoritative manner apprised the Democratic members that we were here to perform
                our Constitutional duties and would in no wise trammel ourselves with pledges
                precedent as an inducement to their reappearance. Here was our action and our
                utterance as a party. Has the resolution then passed been since retracted? If so,
                when? Do we not know that the same proposition which came to us on Wednesday evening
                was again sent to our caucus the next day - sent certified as the demand of the
                Democracy as a party? - and that it encountered the rebuff of a decisive silence.
                Not a word of response was deigned on the occasion. What next? An hour later, and
                while our caucus was still in session, a second proposition was sent to us. It
                proved a huge descent from the first lofty stand-point. It was now requested that we
                should give our Democratic friends at least two days notice before acting upon the
                obnoxious amendment! But this proposal fared no better than the first. Its treatment
                was a like silence. And here ended our action and intercourse upon the subject, as a
                party. Here, as a party, ends our record; and you search it in vain for the trace of
                those assurances and pledges concerning which so much is said in and out of print;
                in and out of this chamber.

              But we are given to understand that individual pledges from our side are out on
                this subject. Concerning these it is enough to say that they cannot be urged against
                us as a party. They may bind those implicated, but can reach no farther. They
                constitute a matter of account to be settled between our Democratic brethren and the
                individual members of our party committed to the pledges. But the presumptions are
                against the existence of any compact at the time our brethren returned to these
                halls and their duty. Otherwise why should our adversaries manifest such trepidation
                over the resolutions now pending? If private pledges were out, they must have been
                sufficiently numerous to control the situation - else it would have been folly for
                Democracy to come back upon the strength of the same. If adequate in number, why the
                unmistakeable alarm shown at present? Senators knew that gentlemen stand by their
                word of honor, and if such honorable pledges are out it is known to all parties
                concerned in them. Surely no one can have so insulting an opinion of any member of
                the General Assembly as to suppose that the word of honor which he pledges to an
                adversary will be violated by him either in letter or spirit.

              The presumptive evidence is fortified by the facts. I admit that after the
                adjournment of our caucus last Thursday certain members of our party, feeling rather
                sensitive in this crisis and weighing the comparative importance of general State
                Legislation, with the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment, thought it best to
                subordinate the latter to the former, and accordingly committed themselves by verbal
                promised to a portion of a Democratic members that State Legislation should be
                preferred, and that at least one days notice should precede the consideration of the
                amendment. A sufficient number of these promises were secured to command the result
                both in this and the other house. I am advised that the verbal character of the
                agreement excited such distrust that a leader of the Democratic wing found it
                necessary to apprise those of our side who were in the arrangement that the must be
                in writing and signed! after which it should prove all sufficient. This was acceeded
                to and that which was verbal became written. Will it be denied that all which
                beforehand lay in parol was now merged and embodied in into the writing? The paper,
                so signed, was put the possession of the Democratic caucus and I am given to
                understand that all Friday and most of Saturday's forenoon was spent by them in
                discussing the reliability for truth and trustworthiness of the gentlemen whose
                names we subscribed to the document! What conclusion was arrived at I don't
                know, but before twelve o'clock of Saturday, a Democratic member of the House,
                called upon the gentleman whose name appeared first upon the written proposition and
                gave him to understand, as I am informed, that unless the members who had signed the
                paper would allow it to be published in the public prints it would not be considered
                by the Democratic representation. Such a demand indicated a purpose to parade the
                document as a concession tendered by our party. It could mean nothing else. The
                gentleman addressed, properly regarding it in this light, and feeling now satis  the insincerity of those who had been asking
                reasonable pledges as a condition preliminary to their re-appearance here, promptly
                asked a return of the paper, and it was handed back then and there; and, I am told,
                due notice was then given that the return of the paper should be considered an end
                of all negotiations between its signers and the Democratic wing of the Legislature.
                This occurred last Saturday.

              Now, sir, the Democratic members saw fit to reappear and qualify yesterday both in
                the House and Senate. They came into the chamber at a timely moment. We were then
                debating the proposition of declaring their seats vacant and would have reached a
                vote, (which could not have been other than an affirmative vote,) in the course of a
                few minutes. And I now assert, what it was my object to say when I took the floor,
                that they came back voluntarily and at their own risk and at a time when the members
                of our party was untrammeled by any promises. Let the world know this, and no more
                be said of "breach of faith."In further exposition of this matter I ask
                that the Secretary read the editorial which appeared in the Indianapolis Sentinel (Democratic,) of this morning, headed "The Legislature
                - the organization of both brances," which I now send up.

              The Secretary read as follows:

              
                THE LEGISLATURE- THE
                    ORGANIZATION OF  BOTH BENCHES.-Both branches of the General Assembly were organized yesterday
                  afternoon and proceeded with business. Upon the written pledge of eighteen
                  Senators and Representatives that the ratification of the proposed Constitutional
                  Amendment should not be attempted until ample notice was given of the intention,
                  the Democratic members of the Legislature, elected at the recent special election,
                  presented their credentials yesterday afternoon, and were qualified. It will be
                  noticed by the House proceedings that the arrangement was carried out in good
                  faith in that body by the adoption of a resolution, the reconsideration of which
                  was laid upon the table, an action which makes it binding, not to enter upon the
                  consideration of the ratification of the proposed Constitutional Amendment before
                  the 11th day of May. This action insures the adoption of all necessary
                  legislation. We sincerely hope a better feeling will prevail, which will end in
                  submitting the controversy to the verdict et the people, and thus recognize the
                  foundation principle of a free government that the people are the true source of
                  power, and that the will of the majority should govern.
              

              Mr. STEIN. Thus it will be seen that the Democratic organ of this city bases the
                reappearance of the Democratic members here upon the strength and faith of that
                written paper thus signed. The version thus given is running abroad and already I
                find it in the Democratic paper published in my own city, (Lafayette.) Nothing is
                said of the withdrawal of we proposal, nor of the circumstances under which the
                proposal was originally delivered to the Democratic members. These circumstances
                have not yet been mentioned, but they deserve to be declared ; as we thereby have an
                explanation why the subsequent demand to have the paper published bore such an
                offensive character. When the written pledge was placed into the hands of the
                Democrats they were distinctly apprised that it was a private
                pledge, with which the Republicans as a party had no connection. As such, and also
                because some of those who had lent their names to it apprehended that they had
                thereby somewhat compromised themselves, they required that the document should be
                kept private and not thrust into print. But they expressed their willingness that it
                should be held to the end of the session as a guarantee of their fidelity to the
                engagements contained in it. Should these be violated the paper was to be published
                as a justification of the one side and a proof of the treachery of the other. These
                was the stipulations upon which the paper was originally delivered.

              But, as I said before, this paper was returned and in the possession of one of its
                signers on Saturday before noon. Pie had it and I saw it with my own eyes before
                twelve o'clock of that day. I make bold to say it has not from that moment been
                back in Democratic hands. Its return was construed as a termination of the truce or
                armistice between the contracting parties; there could be no other construction
                about it.

              Now permit me to read some sentences contained in the Indianapolis Journal (Republican) of this morning. I will read myself until I come to the
                main letter. I read from an editorial headed: "What the Democratic caucus
                did."

              
                
                WHAT THE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS DID.-We gave a sketch yesterday of the
                  negotiations between the caucus of Democrats and the Republicans as to the'
                  terms upon which the former would consent to do their duty. We propose to complete
                  it to-day. The Democrats agreed that, if they could have the assurances of enough
                  Republicans to keep the Constitutional Amendment out of the way of other business,
                  that it should be kept out of the way, and due notice given them when it should be
                  taken up, they would take their seats, permit the Legislature to be organized, and
                  help do the work they had been elected at a cost of $50,000 to do. The Republicans
                  accepted the proposition, though they were under no obligation of duty or courtesy
                  to do more than they had done since Thursday; that is, hold themselves in their
                  places ready for work at any moment when the recusant Democrats should come in and
                  give them a quorum. They made an agreement in writing that they would not allow
                  the Constitutional Amendment to be taken up till necessary legislation had been
                  completed, and that they would give up a day's notice of their purpose to
                  take it up. Thirteen Representatives and five Senators signed it. They were
                  enough, with the Democrats to control all action upon the amendment. This was
                  exactly what was asked. The Democratic caucus on Saturday, by a vote of
                  twenty-five to twenty-three, refused to abide by the agreement. They asked the
                  Republican members to let them publish it, " as an explanation to their
                  constituents" of their consent to do their duty. The Republicans refused to
                  do that, as the whole transaction was an individual and private affair, pledges of
                  individual Republicans to individual Democrats. They said to the Committee of the
                  caucus, " if you want to explain to your constituents your action in doing what you were elected to
                  do, you have only to point them to the Constitution which makes it your duty to
                  organize, and transact the State's business. If that is not explanation
                  enough, it is not our affair to furnish it." When the Democrats rejected this
                  pledge, the Republicans at once withdrew it, and told the caucus that they had now
                  no pledges or promises to make, but that they were and would be always in their
                  places ready for work. The Democrats, in spite of this, then attempted to get a
                  second pledge. Though they had broken their agreement, they had the coolness to
                  ask another, as if anybody could trust them to abide by it any more honorably than
                  they did by the first one, They asked that the Republicans should make the same
                  pledge as before, but should give it to the caucus instead of to individual
                  members. To this proposition, which was made on Saturday, the Republicans, by Hon.
                  Milton S. Osborn, replied as follows:
              

              The Republicans replied as follows. And now I ask the Secretary to read the letter.
                The Seretary read:

              
                
                  
                    
                    
                       INDIANAPOLIS, IND., April 12, 1869.
                      GENTLEMEN:
                    

                     Your communication of the l0th. inst., addressed to myself and some other
                      members of the General Assembly, was placed in my hands about six o'clock
                      Saturday afternoon. I endeavored at once to see the gentlemen named, to submit
                      to them your proposition. I have not been able to see all of them up to this
                      time. Your communication has been considered by such as I have seen, and they
                      say that they signed the agreement referred to, in consideration of assurances
                      given to them personally by several Democratic members elect that such an
                      agreement in writing would remove the obstacle which seemed to prevent an
                      organization of the Legislature, and from an impression made by the Democratic
                      caucus in their third proposition. While they regarded the requirement that
                      their often repeated promise to take no advantage of the minority to pass the
                      fifteenth amendment should be put in " black and white," as not
                      entirely respectful, and certainly unusual, they consented to do so, in order
                      to secure the much needed legislation for the State. We are notified by the
                      resolution of a Democratic caucus, a copy of which you have kindly placed in
                      my hands, that the proposition we made to such Democratic members elect as had
                      expressed their intention to qualify if such assurance could be given them,
                      had been rejected, but that if said proposition were put in a different shape
                      it might be acted upon.

                    Such of the Senators and Representatives as I have submitted your
                      communication to say that they have already given all the assurance as to what
                      their course will be that could reasonably be required, and that they have
                      been disregarded in every form made; and while they desire and seek nothing
                      but a fair and undisguised course in any act of Legislation, they can see no
                      good that will result from any additional promises to gentlemen who have so
                      uniformity rejected promises which they had given strong assurances would be
                      accepted, and would induce gentlemen who possessed the power, to permit an
                      organization. I therefore respectfully assure you that we have no additional
                      promises to make, but will be ready at two o'clock this day, if a quorum
                      shall assemble, to proceed with the much needed Legislation.
                    
                      Very respectfully,
                      MILTON A. OSBORN
                      Hon. J. M. HANNA, Hon. C. R. CORY, Hon. JAMES M. SLEETH.
                    
                  
                
              

              Now, sir, I call upon the Senator from Sullivan [Mr. Hanna] to say whether that
                letter was received by him?

              Mr. HANNA. That letter was received by me yesterday.

              Mr. STEIN. Then a fair presumption is that it was laid before the Democratic
                members of the Senate and House.

              Mr. HANNA (in his seat.) Do you want a statement to that effect?

              Mr. STEIN. No sir. I take it for granted - 

              Mr. HANNA (in his seat.) There is no presumption about it.

              Mr. STEIN. The paper further proceeds:

              The Republicans had no more pledges to make to men who, as they say, "had so
                uniformly rejected" the pledges they had asked. The Democrats could get
                nothing. After the transmission to them of Mr. Osborn's letter, not one word of
                promises, pledges or negotiations in any shape took place. They took their seats and
                allowed the Legislature to be organized without a breath of assurance, where they
                had been so resolute to have all sorts of pledges four days before. They fell
                heavily and not at all gracefully. They had followed Mr. T.A. Hendricks so far that
                they could not go ahead without breaking their necks, not get back without a
                ludicrous fall.

              These are the remarks of the editor, it is true, but they embody the understanding
                which prevails without exception among the members of our party. If, since the
                withdrawal of the original written proposition any new promises, verbal or written,
                have been made, they are such I know not of-they have escaped the publicity of even
                rumor. Had any been extant it is not likely that the Sentinel in
                its article of this morning, already read to the Senate, would have omitted allusion
                to it. I therefore conclude there were no other promises, and feel warranted to
                assert, from what has been said that the Democrats came back, at their risk and
                without pledges outstanding from any member of our side.

              But let me return for a moment and analyze the character of the written paper,
                returned last Saturday, and for argument sake consider it as still a pending
                engagement. Can it be so construed as to carry its signers against the resolutions
                of the Senator from Jefferson, [Mr. Cravens,] now under discussion? These
                resolutions do not contemplate an abrupt consideration of the Fifteenth Amendment.
                They postpone the matter of ratification to a remote day, In the interim all
                necessary State Legislation can be accomplished. There is nothing prevent the
                recourse of resignation, so familiar to our Democratic brethren. Then why should the
                pledge be referred to as an argument against these resolutions? I happen to hold the
                original paper now. Let me read it omitting the names of the signers:

              We the undersigned, members of the House of Representatives, agree that we will
                vote for no proposition to take up the Constitutional Fifteenth Amendment, before
                the regular and necessary business, and that when a resolution is offered we will
                vote that it go upon the table at least one day before it is considered.

              Mr. HANNA (in his seat.) That is not all the paper. 

              

               Mr. STEIN. That is all of the contract. 

              Mr. HANNA. No sir.

              Mr. STEIN. (Turning over the paper.) Well sir I find the following additional
                passage, which certainly does not affect the contracting Part:

              We, the undersigned Senators, concur in the above.

              This is signed by several Senators.

              Mr. HANNA. No: there is something else.

              Mr. STEIN. (Handing the paper to a page) I will pass the paper to the Senator. He
                shall satisfy himself by ocular inspection that I have omitted nothing but the
                signatures.

              Now sir, will Senators of the opposition say that this pledge is a signification
                from those signing it that the Democrats shall be at liberty to take all measures to
                defeat completely the ratification of the Fifteenth Amemdment, and that in all such
                measures the signers will aid them? That would be a most violent and unnatural
                construction of the paper. Such is not the purport of the paper, and such never have
                been the purpose of any of the signers. Where is the Republican of this Legislature
                who has ever intended to take a step looking to the utter prevention of the
                ratification? Many of us, myself among the rest, have been opposed to even so much
                as a temporary postponement of the great event. Many of us consider that this
                Fifteenth Amendment appeals to us as patriots of the whole nation and that before it
                the local legislation may well stand suspended for a day. I look upon it as
                embodying the vital principle upon which our government must be reconstructed, or
                our country lapse back at length into the trouble from which she has just emerged.
                Without this measure, in my judgment, the country cannot attain the crowning acme of
                its development. The principle of universal protection must accompany the idea of
                citizenship; else all is insecure. Now we have declared citizenship to the negro and
                will we deny him that absolute protection which can only be guaranteed by the
                ballot? It is by the ballot alone that the rights of the citizen obtain their
                complete sovereignty - unless thus protected it is in vain to talk about rights. A
                disfranchised people are always at the mercy of the ballot-holders of the land. But
                by that quiet and mighty weapon, the ballot, they can always protect themselves.

              Mr. BIRD. Will the Senator allow me? I ask the Senator if he believes that he could
                go before the people of his district and be elected upon the issue of the
                Constitutional Amendment?

              Mr. STEIN. I would have a very unworthy opinion of my constituents if I thought
                otherwise. Yes sir, upon this very issue, I stand prepared to go before the people
                of Tippecanoe eounty, convinced that I would be abundantly sustained by the
                intelligent people whom I have the honor to represent here.I grant that, as a
                present question throughout the State at large, we might have to fight you at a
                disadvantage. The sad preponderance of unreasoning prejudice and life-long
                prepossessions stand frequently in the path of the most salutary reforms. But let us
                once ratify this amendment, and, as an accomblished fact, the people will acquiesce
                in it as readily and as cheerfully as they did a few years since in the memorable
                Emancipation Proclamation of Lincoln. This is one of the great reformatory movements
                of the age; and it wonld be a singular exception to its kind, did it not encounter
                fierce opposition in the outstart. It was in contention with relentless adversaries
                that Christ preached the new gospel. Reforms are not born in the midst of plaudits
                arid acclamation. Through persecution and buffetings they win their way to their
                inevitable ultimate dominion. But, once established, the people look back with
                relief, and glorify the courageous souls who through cloud and sunshine carried the
                banner and accomplished the victory.

              Sir, I admit that, upon this question of ratification, we and the Democratic party
                stand upon terms of bitter and undying hostility. We ask no quarter, and we give no
                quarter. We do not expect an offer of quarter; and I trust that no Republication
                Senator or Representative, after what has happened, will be found to bend the hinges
                of his knee to a part notoriously seeking here, by faction and rebellion, to
                frustrate and defeat this great measure.

              We look to see this amendment pass sooner or later. It will be the law of the land.
                It may become such before the ratification of this State will be required. And oh!
                may the day when that ratification shall be given here be near at hand-and near at
                hand the hour when the final ratification shall be proclaimed all over the land-when
                the protection of the civil rights guaranteed by the Constitution of our common
                country shall be guaranteed by that higher power-the highest power under God
                Almighty-the power of the ballot. 

            
            

          
          

          

          
            SUPPLEMENTARY TO THE BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
              VOLUME ELEVENTH
            Compensation of the Judges----Debate in Continuation.
            IN SENATE.
            
               WEDNESDAY, April 15, 1869.
            
             [IN CONTINUATION--p. 50.] 

            
              AFTERNOON SESSION.

               Mr. Scott's bill, [S. 45] relating to the salaries of the Supreme, Circuit,
                Civil and Criminal Courts and Common Pleas Judges and declaring an emergency, being
                under consideration-

              Mr. BRADLEY moved to amend by increasing the salary of Supreme Judges to three
                thousand nine hundred and fifty dollars. Circuit Judges to two thousand nine hundred
                and seventy-five dollars; Common Pleas Judged to two thousand four hundred dollars,
                and Circuit Prosecutors to nine hundred dollars, and Common Pleas Prosecutors to
                five hundred dollars.

              Mr, GREEN argued in favor of increasing the salaries of the Supreme Judges. If the
                present judges were paid in proportion to the salary received in the time of Judge
                Blackford, they should get about $6,000 or $7,000 per annum.

              By the act of January 28, 1818 the salary of the Judges of the Supreme Court was
                fixed at seven hundred dollars. (R. S. 1824 p. 367.) Nineteen years later, January
                21, 1837, the salary was increased to fifteen hundred dollars, (R. S. 1838 p. 302.)
                December 14, 1843, the Legislature passed an act reducing the salary to thirteen
                hundred dollars, (acts 1844 p. 13) but this, under the Constitution, did not affect
                the salary of the judges then in office, for the term for which they were
                appointed.

              On the 18th of June 1852, the salary was farther reduced to twelve hundred dollars.
                (R. 8. 1852 p. 433.)By the act of March 5, 1859, the salary was increased to two
                thousand dollars. ( 1 G. and H. p. 539.)

              The salary was again advanced to three thousand dollars in March 1865, (acts 1865
                p. 129.)

              1. Blackford, of 433 pages, contains the decisions of the Court from the May term
                1817 to the May term 1826 both inclusive,-a period of nine and a half years.

              The second, third and two hundred and seventy eigth pages of fourth Blackford
                contain the judgments of the Court from the November term 1826 to the November term
                1836 both inclusive, a period of eleven years. Seventy-two pages contain a report of
                the omitted cases, from the organization of the court up to and including the
                November term 1836.

              For the period of four years covered by the present salary there has been published
                and now in press seven volumes of reports, nearly two volumes a year.

              The cases submitted at the May and November term 1868 will make more than two
                volumes of reports.

              The labor of the Judges of that court is now more than ten-fold that of the period
                for which they received a salary of seven hundred dollars.

              Seven thousand dollars a year now would not equal seven hundred for the period of
                twenty and a half years from the organization of the court, regarding alone the
                labor performed, but considering the increase in values it would require a much
                larger sum to equal that awarded to the Jndges by the founders of the state.

              These Supreme Judges sit in their rooms all the time; and it becomes tiresome. But
                they are compelled to work. A Circuit Judge can get off the bench and leave the
                court. He can get some one to act for him. I hope this Legislature will increase the
                salaries of the Supreme Judges if not of the others. It is & thing demanded by
                every sense of justice.

              Mr. ARMSTONG moved to strike from $3,950 the figure "9," and insert
                "0."

              Mr. HANNA. Mr. President: I opposed this bill last session because, as I stated
                then, certain County officers received larger salaries  the Judges of the Supreme Court. Some of the County
                officers step around and enjoy themselves while making from eight to ten thousand
                dollars a year. I was Circuit Judge a while and got one thousand dollars a year, but
                I resigned (it is a luxury to me to resign occasionally) to accept the office of
                Supreme Judge at one thousand two hundred dollars; for the two hundred dollars if
                nothing else. Although I had to do a good deal more work I had rather be a Circuit
                than a Supreme Judge at anything like the same salary. It may be possible, as to the
                number of hours, that a Supreme Judge has more work than a Circuit Judge; but there
                is a certain process herein a man dries himself up mentally when f works steadily
                day after day and hour after hour. I take it that the salary of the Supreme Judge
                ought to be more than the salary of a Circuit Judge. No man ought to be a judge
                unless in the vigor of his manhood and intellect Nor ought he to receive so small a
                salary that at the end of nine years, he would come off as I did, not worth a dollar
                more than when he went on. Do you require that kind of sacrifice of public servants?
                It is not right nor proper. You ought to pay your Judge a sum sufficient to raise
                him above want and the daily cares of life. We do not economise in the right
                direction. I believe that fact is exemplified when we vote ourselves fifty dollars
                worth of stationery, when we don't use five. I do not pretend to countenance
                any such nonsense, and yet I take it vigorously. I take it and carry it off in open
                day light: I did not take it after dark. When the public give it to me I take it and
                I think I earn it. We have raised our own salary two dollars a day by the
                indirection of voting postage stamps to each member, and yet we stand here
                hesitating whether we will vote an increase of salaries to the Judges of your
                Courts. When a man goes on the bench he should withdraw himself from the people; and
                if a man sees proper to devote his time to the public, we ought to permit our Judges
                to lay up something for a sick hour. I am opposed to making fish of one class of
                public servants and flesh of another. I agree in the opinion that our whole Judicial
                system should be reformed; but I did not desire to take upon myself the amount of
                labor necessary for the preparation of the proper bills to effect that object. True
                I have as great an interest in it as any body, but the burden of the Government does
                not rest upon my shoulders, nor the shoulders of the party with which I act. It is
                too late in the session now to undertake such 
                  at hing
                  a thing
                , but that does not prevent our doing simple justice to officers. I managed
                to live, breathe and have a being on one thousand dollars a year, as Circuit Judge:
                twelve hundred dollars a year for three years, as Supreme Judge, and two thousand
                dollars a year for the balance of the time. During all that time I paid some sixteen
                hundred dollars a year, as my good wife says, for family expenses. I have but one
                way of keeping accounts, and that is: when I get money I put it in my pocket, and
                when it is all gone, that is the cash account balanced. 

            
            

          
          

          

          
            SUPPLEMENTARY TO THE BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS
              VOLUME ELEVENTH.
            Minors in the Cotton and Woollen Factories----Hon. SimonWile,
              of Laporte,
            HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
            
               THURSDAY, April 22, 1869,
            

             Mr. Williams of Union's bill [H. R. 283.] a bill regulating the employment of
              persons under sixteen years of age in Cotton and Woollen Factories in this State, and
              providing for the education of such persons, was taken up-it being the special order
              for this hour.

            SECTION 1 proposes that no person under the age of sixteen years
              shall be employed in any Cotton or Woolen factory in this State unless such person
              shall have attended school at least twelve weeks during the twelve months immediately
              preceeding; nor shall such person be employed in such factories for a longer period
              than nine months in any one year.

            "SEC. 2. No person under the age of sixteen years shall be
              employed in any Cotton or Woolen factory more than eleven hours in any one
              day."

            SEC. 3, Fixes the penalty for violation of this act at a fine of
              not less than fifty dollars nor more than one hundred dollars.

            The question being on Mr. Stewart of Ohio's amendment to strike out the word
              "eleven" in section two and insert in lieu thereof the word
              "eight,"

            Mr. WILE said:

            Mr. President: I am opposed to the passage of this bill. In stating my objection
              however, I beg to say in advance, that I am not actuated by any selfish motives. I
              trust that my motives are placed upon the solid basis of right.

            In stating the reasons for the vote I shall give, I speak somewhat from actual
              experience.

            In the first place this bill discriminates, unjustly, between cotton and woolen
              manufacturing establishments and other branches of industry, placing restrictions that
              must work to the disadvantage of one branch, while foundries, rolling mills and other
              manufacturing interests are exempt from the provisions of the bill. They are permitted
              to employ whom they please, work them as long as they may choose, regardless of age or
              time, while this bill discriminates against one of the prominent departments of
              industry.

            Mr. Speaker, it is a fact that must be patent to every candid mind that this
              discrimination, is, in every sense unjust. The woolen and cotton manufacturing
              interest in this State has but recently commenced the process of development, and for
              the short period of its existence, has gained such a position, that the State may well
              be proud of it. If gentlemen will but pause, and reflect that by the passage of this
              bill, they virtually place such obstacles in the way of the progress of one of the
              most useful branches of industry, as will seriously cripple and discourage the further
              improvement of the same.

            Mr. Speaker, I can not reconcile my mind to the belief that this House, upon calm
              reflection, will pass a measure, which, in effect, would be calculated to place a
              check upon one department of mechanical industry-discriminating in favor of the one,
              to the prejudice of the other.

            As to the remaining provisions of the bill, making a change in the working hours from
              ten to eleven hours, I am totally opposed.

            Ten hours labor per day is sufficient for employer and employes. Practical experience
              has fully demonstrated, to the satisfaction of all familiar with the subject, that all
              experiments in changing the time from ten to eight hours, have resulted in failure;
              and the old system of ten hours still prevails. 

            

            I agree fully with the charitable views presented by the gentleman from Cass, [Mr.
              McFadin and the gentleman from Ohio, [Mr. Stewart in regard to working children in
              factories of all kinds; but when these gentlemen speak with vehemence and earnestness
              of the "soulless corporations," I must beg leave with them. It is a fact
              that no gentleman will deny, these corporations have added largely to the wealth of
              the State, giving steady employment to hundreds and thousands of poor widows and
              orphan children, whose condition would, in many instances, be deployable in the
              extreme, should the ideas presented by these gentlemen on this floor, prevail.

            Gentlemen have intimated that these "soulless corporations" might go
              somewhere else to seek investment for their capital. I insist that this is a very
              hasty conclusion. I would beg leave to remind the eloquent gentleman who made these
              intimations, that the citizens of his own town held out large inducements to a certain
              woolen manufacturing company-a "soulless corporation"-to locate and build
              their works there.

            The people of this State, as well as the citizens of all the Northwestern States,
              should fell and fully consider every measure calculated to work to the disadvantage of
              their enterprising capitalists. Our manufacturing establishments are yet young, and we
              lack experience. Besides all this, we have to contend with many disadvantages thrown
              around us by the New England monopolies; therefore, if you bridle this enterprise, in
              its infancy, in such a way as to retard its progress, disastrous results must be the
              inevitable consequence, and manufactories, instead of increasing, will decrease.

            One more point and I am done. The bill under consideration provides that minors
              between the ages of eight and sixteen years, shall not be allowed to work more than
              nine months in the year. This provision is a good one, I admit, but like all the other
              provisions of the bill, refers and applies to the woolen and cotton manufactories
              only. This, of itself, should condemn the bill at once. If my opinions are correctly
              founded, this House has no right to confer special legislative favors on one branch of
              industry, to the exclusion of the other.

            Sir, I ask is this bill calculated to advance the industrial pursuits of this State?
              or is it intended to protect the interests and welfare of the poor?

            I submit that it is not. Our cotton and woolen manufactories are in their infancy,
              and compelled, as it were, to educate their own help; and under this bill, are
              required to do the same thing every nine months, and in this way incur great
              inconvenience and expense. Under this provision of the bill, you place before the
              manufacturer two alternatives, one of which they must adopt. One of which is to train
              a new set of hands every nine months; the other is to discharge at once the poor boy
              and girl, who, by their daily labor, perhaps, support a widowed mother, thereby
              compelling him or her to seek a new field of employment, not under the restrictions
              proposed in this bill. The consequence to the employe must be apparent. The change of
              avocation is followed by a loss of time in securing a new situation. Again, after
              obtaining another place the learning a new-trade is a serious matter. I therefore
              submit that the remedy sought by this measure is not attained, but that the bill will
              work to the disadvantage of both the employer and employe.

            Which horn of the dilemma, Mr. Speaker, will the manufacturers choose? Is it not
              reasonable to suppose that they will pursue that policy which will insure to them a
              steady set of hands ? They would prefer to pay higher wages for older help, than to
              make a change of hands every nine months. I would not have it understood that I am in
              favor of a policy that would keep our youths away from school.

            I hold that it is every good citizen's sacred duty to encourage education, and
              urge it upon those who feel indifferent about it, but I claim that this measure will
              fall far short of accomplishing the desired end. I hope, Mr. Speaker, that the bill
              and pending amendments will not meet with the approval of this House. 

          
          

          

          
            SUPPLEMENTARY TO THEBREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS
              VOLUME ELEVENTH.
            Charter of Notre Dame du Lac Debate in Continuation,
            IN SENATE.
            
              WEDNESDAY, April 14, 1869,
            
            [IN CONTINUATION p. 53.]

            Mr. Wolcott's bill [S. 285] amending the charter of Notre Dame coming up in
              order it was read the second time.

            Mr. ROBINSON of Decatur. I move to refer that bill to the Committee on
                Corporations.

            Mr. WOLCOTT. Mr. President: This is a bill simply to increase the power of the
              University of Notre Dame Du Lac to hold one hundred thousand dollars worth of real
              property instead of thirty thousand dollars, as now provided by its charter. It is
              kuown as one of the most flourishing institutions in the State, having between five
              and six hundred students in the University proper, besides the number attending the
              female department. And it has a manual labor branch. It does not come here as the
              Bloomington University asking an appropriation. It simply asks to be permitted by
              authority of law to hold that amount of real estate which shall enable it to carry out
              the general purposes for which it is being now conducted-that of a University, or
              large school with a manual labor or agricultural branch. The society has purchrsed a
              body of cheap swamp lands in the vicinity, which it is reclaiming by the labor of the
              students that will-increase in value rapidly: and it simply asks that its capacity to
              hold real estate may be equal to the requirements of the University. This bill grants
              no new powers in other respects-the recitation of powers there is a repetition of the
              old charter. Every person knows that this University is not second to any in the State
              in its usefulness. The bill was before a Committee twice and they have reported
              favorably upon it.

            Mr. ROBINSON of Decatur. Mr. President: I see no objection to the reference. This
              institution is entitled to hold all its building apparatus, and everything of that
              kind and stands in that respect on the same foundation with institutions of a similar
              character And why should they have these greater privileges? I have heard something in
              regard to this matter that makes me suspicious in regard to the demands this
              institution makes.

            Mr. CARSON. As far as I am able to understand the bill, I am in favor of it. But I do
              not think the Committee on corporations the proper one to refer it to; I prefer that
              it go to the Judiciary Committee.

            Mr. BRADLEY. I do not see any necessity for this bill going to any Committee. It does
              not increase the powers of this institution only as to holding a certain amount of
              land.

            Mr. CARSON. I do not so understand that from the reading of the bill. They ask not to
              purchase and hold any more land, but the same land at a greater value.

            Mr. FISHER. Mr. President: One remark which fell from the Senator from White, [Mr.
              Wolcott,] makes it look to me like it was incorporating a land speculation. He states
              that they have bought - a quantity of swamp land three or four miles away. What do
              they want it there for? He says they have ditched it, and wish to hold it. What for?
              Not for their benefit and use because it is three or four miles away. I am willing the
              College should hold all the land necessary for the use of the institution; but to make
              big land speculators of these societies and allow them to hold large estates;these
              things I do not think are right. I think they ought to be examined and caitically
              examined. I am opposed to giving any incorporated
              body power to buy large tracts of land and hold them.

            Mr. BELLAMY. Mr. President : The bill provides instead of holding thirty thousand
              dollars exclusive of improvements the society may hold one hundred thousand dollars
              exclusive of improvements. I suppose if they put one million dollars of improvements
              on their lands they could hold it, so the Committee thought it necessary to add a
              clause that only two hundred and forty of land and improvement should be held.

            Mr. WOLCOTT. Mr. President: It is well known that the Agricultural Colleges
              throughout the States have located large bodies of for their exclusive benefit. What
              difference does it make whether the investment be in lands, in stocks or other forms.
              It seems to me the objections urged are narrow and without thought or reflection. Here
              is an institution based, to a great extent, upon a manual labor school, having a
              department to teach agricultural science, an institution having within its walls five
              or six hundred pupils, and yet Senators object to increasing its authority to hold
              real property from thirty to one hundred thousand dollars! A most surprising
              objection.

            Mr. FISHER. I have no objection to any amount of money, means, or capital that that
              or any other institution of learning may have, I predicated my remarks upon a
              statement the Senator himself made; that the institution was entering into a land
              speculation;-that the society bought land not for the use of the College, but for the
              purpose of making money.

            Mr. WOLCOTT. There is nothing contained in the grant of power of this institution, to
              buy or sell land. They are authorized to buy or receive property to a limited amount,
              and if they get an excess they are bound to sell it. This is not a rich institution.
              It is an institution supported in a great degree by the labor of those attending
              school. Not being rich they bought some cheap lands-the whole amount of the purchase
              is but fifteen thousand dollars. Doubtless that will be increased or enhanced in value
              by the labor of the students of the institution. It will not be a site on which one
              million of dollars will be expended in improvements. It would now not be subject to
              much taxation, but by an express provision of the bill, after reaching a certain
              valuation by a law of the State it is subject to taxation. I see no reason why this
              bill should not be sustained.

            The motion to refer the bill to the Committee on Corporations was
              then agreed to.

            Expunging Resolution---Debate in Continuation,
            IN SENATE.
            
              FRIDAY, April, 23, 1869.
            

            
              AFTERNOON SESSION.
              [IN CONTINUATION-1st column, p. 99.]

              Mr. RICE, by leave, offered a resolution as follows:

              
                
                  
                    RESOLVED, That the resolution of the Senate in relation to
                      the correspondence of Lieutenant Governor Cumback with Governor Baker, and the
                      proceedings of the Senate in relation thereto be expunged from the journal of
                      the Senate and that the Secretary of the Senate be directed to write across
                      the face of said resolutions and proceedings, "Expunged by order of the
                      Senate."
                  
                
              

              Mr. RICE. [Mr. , in the Chair] Mr. President: If no other Senator designs to
                address the Senate, I will demand the previous question.

              Mr. HANNA. If the Senator gives way I will move to set this down for Tuesday next
                at two o'clock and make it the special order for that hour.

              Mr. RICE. I prefer that this thing shall go to a vote without taking up time.

              Mr. TURNER. For certain reasons, perhaps improper to express right here now, having
                committed myself heretofore, I would vote for the resolution, and intend to do so,
                but I want to make some remarks prior to the time of my doing so, and don't
                feel this afternoon exactly in the humor.

              Mr. CRAVENS. I will ask the Senator from Vigo, [Mr. Hanna,] to extend it one day in
                order that we may have a full Senate present when the vote is taken. I believe when
                the resolutions of censure were brought in, time was given to secure a full Senate.
                I don't expect to consume much, if any time, of the Senate in the discussion of
                this resolution.

              Mr. HANNA. I want time to consider it; so that we may act together in this matter.
                I don't conceal anything and will agree to make it Wednesday.

              Mr. RICE. I think the Senate is about as full tosday as usual. On Tuesday we would
                run the risk of having half a dozen Senators absent.

              SEVERAL SENATORS. "Tuesday,"
                "Tuesday."

              Mr. HANNA. I will make that motion That this resolution be the order for Tuesday
                two o'clock, p. m.

              Mr. HOOPER. I move to amend by saying Wednesday at two o'clock.

              Mr. LEE. Mr. President. I want to say that I can't see any cause why we should
                not act on it this afternoon. It has been on the journals too long already. I would
                like an end on it now.

              Mr. TURNER. In all justice to the Lieutenant Governor himself, I think this
                postponement is desirable. I announce it as a foregone conclusion that these
                resolutions will be expunged, and it is to his interest to have as many here as
                possible and let the vote be as large as possible and the opposition as great as
                possible. It is an act of injustice that many of us feel we have done, and we want
                to wipe it out. And I think it is desirable, upon the part of the friends of the
                Lieutenant Governor to fix upon a day when it is likely the most opposition will be
                made.

              Mr. CARSON. My vote depends somewhat upon the discussion, as the language of the
                resolution now stands.

              Mr. FISHER. Mr. President: I do not propose to enter into any extended argument but
                expect simply to give the reasons for my vote. I suppose it is a foregone
                conclusion, as the Senator from Daviess [Mr. Turner] says, that this resolution will
                pass, but I want to put myself right on the record. And justice to those who may
                differ from the Senator who introduced this resolution would seem to indicate that
                the time should be postponed long enough to have as full a Senate at possible  when the final vote comes. I think that part of
                the Senate who voted for the resolutions this one proposes to expunge held it back
                day after day in order to get a full Senate, and I think little as the friends of
                this proposition can do postpone it till next Wednesday. As far as I am personally
                concerned I don't care any thing about it.

              Mr. TURNER. Mr. President: The remark that I made that it is a foregone conclusion
                that these resolutions will be expunged, I meant to explain, but sat down a little
                too quick. I am not very well to-day, sir. It unquestionably a foregone conclusion
                that at some future time those resolutions will be expunged. I know and believe that
                fact as well as I ever knew or believed anything that had not yet happened; but I
                want to ask the indulge of the friends of the Lieutenant Governor upon the ground
                stated by Judge Hanna; that Democrats wish to act as a unit upon this Object and
                they are not yet prepared. They will be at a future day. What is said here this
                afternoon will answer the purposes of the present requirements on the other side to
                make preparation for the great fight to come off next Tuesday or Wednesday.

              Mr. BRADLEY. I would prefer that this resolutioa should come up at an earlier day,
                simply for the reason that I will not be here Tuesday nor Wednesday. Not intimating
                how I will vote I would be glad to be here when the vote is taken.

              Mr. HANNA. I want the reasons that control my vote to go to record. They don't
                do so in this resolution. Without intimating how I will vote, I expect to put the
                reasons for that vote upon the record, it in the affirmative; or if in the negative
                I want to make a short speech. It appears to me under the circumstances it had
                better go over. I therefore insist upon my motion.

              Mr. WOLCOTT. Mr. President: I see no reason for delay. It is true our seats are not
                entirely full, but the Senate is as full as it usually is. I opposed the passage of
                the resolutions at the time they were passed, believing it to be a case the Senate
                had no jurisdiction over, and I think, that it was wrongfully passed, From
                expressions that have been dropped here by various Senators quite a number of
                Democrats have expressed their readiness to vote upon this question, so that there
                can be no doubt but they will vote for expunging the resolutions, and as the entire
                friends of Mr. Cumback will vote that way, I see nothing to be gained by
                postponement. If those who have spoken expressed themselves honestly the resolutions
                will be expunged to-day; it delayed till Tuesday or Wednesday it can no more than be
                expunged.

              Mr. RICE. I have no obejction to its going over till two o'clock Tuesday.

              Mr. HADLEY. If it is considered best to postpone the consideration of this
                resolution, I hope it will not be postponed later than Tuesday, as the Committee to
                visit the National Soldiers' Home, at Dayton, have arranged to go Wednesday
                morning early, and that will take away three members of the Senate.

              Mr. HOOPER. As there seems to be a disposition to put it on Tuesday I withdraw my
                amendment.

              And then-

              The motion to postpone the further consideration of the resolution till Tuesday,
                two o'clock and make it the special order for that hour was agreed to. 

            
            

          
          

          
            IN SENATE.
            
               TUESDAY, April 27, 1869.
            

            
              AFTERNOON SESSION.
              [SEE PAGE 114-FIRST COLUMN.]

              Mr. RICE (Mr. Gray in the Chair) called up the special order for this hour-two
                oclock-being his resolution offered last Friday to expunge from the journal the
                resolutions and proceedings of the Senate in relation to the correspondence of
                Lieutenant Governor Cumback with Governor Baker.

              Mr. RICE. I have no desire to discuss this resolution. I am prepared to vote upon
                it and I suppose every other Senator is. I therefore move the previous question
                although I do not wish to cut off any remarks any Senator may wish to make. And I
                make this motion with the expectation that any Senator may embrace the opportunity
                of explaining his vote when the roll is called.

              Mr. FISHER. I would like the Senator to explain his reason for demanding the
                previous question if he does not wish to cut off debate.

              Mr. RICE. I do not wish to cut off any Senator from an opportunity to explain his
                vote. I repeat my demand for the previous question.

              The demand was seconded by the Senate-20 to 7-and under its operations the
                resolution was passed, by yeas thirty-five, nays eight, as follows:

              
                
                  
                    YEAS-Messrs. Andrews, Bellamy, Carson, Case, Caven,
                      Church, Denbo, Eliot, Gifford, Gray, Hadley, Hamilton, Hanna, Henderson, Howk,
                      Huey, Huffman, Humphreys, Jaquess, Johnson of Spencer, Johnson of Montgomery,
                      Laselle, Lee, Montgomery, Morgan, Rice, Robinson of Madison, Robinson of
                      Decatur, Scott, Sherrod, Smith, Taggart, Turner, Wolcott and Wood-35.

                     NAYS-Messrs. Beardsley, Cravens, Fisher, Fosdick, Hess,
                      Hooper, Kinley and Reynolds-8. 
                  
                  
                
              

              Pending the roll call-

              Mr. CRAVENS, in explanation of his vote said: I believe the Senator from Parke,
                [Mr.  Rice,] gave all parties who desired to
                make any statement the opportunity, when their names were called, to do so. I do not
                know but what it is better for this matter to go without discussion. I have only to
                say that I suppose no Senator was taken by surprise by the introduction of some such
                resolution as this. It certainly has been as clearly foreshadowed as the setting of
                the sun indicates the state of the weather on the following day: or the
                administration of an emetic the coming of a vomit.

              But there is one thing in which I think the friends of this matter have overleaped
                themselves. The proposition is to expunge from the records a vote of censure. Now if
                these Senators desire really to get clear of this matter I do not think they have
                taken the right course, for the sinple reason that we have no record from which the
                resolutions can be expunged. The two Houses composing the Congress of the United
                States each preserves a written record, and upon occasion they can go to the files
                and get hold of the records and expunge therefrom, as was in the case of the
                resolution concerning General Jackson. This body has no preserved record. The
                journal of the last regular session is now entirely beyond the control of this body.
                It has got to be a part of the legislative history of the State of Indiana. We have
                no more control of this journal than we have of the journal of twenty or thirty
                years ago; and how any thing can be effected by this resolution I cannot see. If it
                is a resolution to relieve the Lieutenant Governor from a vote of censure, it seems
                to me this mode will not reach it at all. I shall therefore content myself with
                voting "no" upon this proposition, for I consider it a very absurd
                one.

              Mr. FISHER when his name was called said: It is very well known to the Senate that
                I voted in favor of the resolutions which are sought by this resolution to be
                expunged from the Senate journal. Whatever may have been the fact,whether it was
                right to pass the original resolutions or not,in voting for them I acted
                conscientiously as to what I believed to be right. By voting for this resolution I
                would say by my act in just as plain terms as by anything I could express, that I
                voted for the original resolutions for the purpose of injuring the reputation of
                Col. Cumback and damaging his prospects for United States Senator; and having
                accomplished that object I am willing to take back what I said before. This would be
                the language of my vote, clear and distinct. I deny that imputation. I had no such
                object-no such purpose, and however damaging these resolutions may have been
                considered by Col. Cumback as to his own character I would rather have the stigma
                already placed upon his character placed upon mine than the stigma of the infamous
                act of stabbing a man for the purpose of - 

              Mr. RICE (interrupting.) The Senator certainly has brought up an allusion that does
                not apply. No one could make that charge against the Senator because his action
                shows to the contrary, for he voted to bestow the office United States Senator on
                Col. Cumback after the resolutions referred to were passed.

              Mr. FISHER. It is well known that I voted for Col. Cumback in obedience to the
                behests of party. He was not my choice; and the matter stands as though I voted
                against him. Those resolutions are just as they were then. No new light has dawned
                upon me; - not a particle;and now to vote for expunging them after having voted for
                them in good faith would be an acknowledgement of ah attempt to injure a brother
                Republican for the purpose of defeating his political asperations. If it will not be
                taking up too much of the time of the Senate I would like to refer to some
                transactions at the time.

              The PRESIDENT pro tem. The Chair will say
                that by unanimous consent of the Senate the Senator can proceed.

              SEVERAL SENATORS-"Consent,
                consent"Mr. FISHER. I will say that when the resolution was first introduced by
                the Senator from Daviess [Mr. Turner] calling for this correspondence I supposed it
                to be a Democratic trap. I had heard of this correspondence and had seen newspaper
                accounts of it but supposed the Senator from Daviess introduced that resolution with
                the confident expectation that the Republicans would vote it down, and that was his
                hope and desire:-this was my supposition at that time;-and that then the charge
                could be reiterated by every Democratic press in the State and from every stump with
                the added charge that a corrupt Senate had covered up this corruption. And I thought
                then, as now, that the withholding, the covering up or the refusal to call for that
                correspondence would be more damaging to the Republican party and Col. Cumback
                himself than the bringing of it to light and showing what it was. I did not
                anticipate that that correspondence was of so damaging a character as to affect
                either him or the party;-but I did suppose a refusal to bring it to light would
                damage both. When that correspondence came on:-but preceding that I will say I was
                astonished that every particular and intimate friend of Col. Cumback opposed
                bringing forth that correspondence; and when it came I found it different from what
                I anticipated. I supposed the desire of Col. Cumback for a seat in the United States
                Senate had induced him on the spur of the moment in a thoughtless manner to address
                a letter, perhaps improper in itself, but that it could be easily and satisfactorily
                explained,  and the thing pass away. But it was
                of a little different nature, for it asked the Governor that in the event of not
                comploying with the propostion that he should return the ltter. This showed
                deliberation, this showed thought, this showed consciousness on this part that the
                letter was improper; because if it had been an entirely proper letter he would not
                have asked its return. And then in the concluding sentance he says: I hope the unity
                of the Republican party may be preserved; which interpreted means that unless this
                proposition is accepted the unity of the Republican party cannot be preserved. This
                showed a kind of deliberation which placed him in an awkward position. No man ever
                heard me express the opinion that there was a corrupt purpose on the part of Col.
                Cumback. The question was upon the correspondence itself, and the only question was:
                Did those resolutions properly characterize that correspondence? That was the
                question; and after being amended as they were upon my own motion I thought they did
                properly characterize that correspondence; and thus I voted. I have seen no occasion
                to change my opinion. I believe they did characterize that correspondence as it
                should be. I believe no milder language could characterize that correspondence as it
                should be, and thus believing I can see no reason why I should vote for this
                expunging resolution. I had nothing to care about reputation; the question was upon
                the paper itself and upon that paper I voted.

              I suppose this resolution is to be psssed. I understand it to be a foregone
                conclusion. I am raising no opposition to it. I am only stating reasons proper for
                myself. I suppose our Democratic friends who voted with us for those resolutions are
                prepared to vote for this resolution. Were I a Democrat with the view I have of
                their political ethics I should probably vote for expunging the resolutions. Their
                object is the upbuilding of their own party. Col. Cumback is a prominent leader of
                the Republican party and they think he is sufficiently laid upon the shelf by the
                action of last session. Now they are willing to take it back in the hope that
                indirectly they will lay Governor Baker upon the shelf and thus two prominent
                Republicans will be out of the way in their estimation. I give them notice that they
                are mistaken in the effect of their action, either Colonel Cumback nor Governor
                Baker are on the shelf, nor will they be by any action 'hey can take. With this
                explanation I vote "no" upon this resolution. 

              Mr. HAMILTON, when his name was lied said : It is very well known to Senators how
                have stood upon this question. All I have got to say in explanation now is that I
                know I should not be representing the wishes of my constituents, both Democratic and
                Republican, if I did not vote in favor of this resolution. Consequently I think that
                is explanation enough without reference to my former course; and I vote
                "aye."

              Mr. HANNA, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote said: I did not
                intend to say any thing, if it had not been for the declaration of the Senator from
                Wabash, [Mr. Fisher.] professing to point out motives of members of the Democratic
                party who are here, with reference to their action. Now it may be sufficient for me
                to say for myself, and I speak only for myself, that when I voted upon this question
                before, (and I voted for the resolutions,) the Senate will recollect there were
                several of them. One was a resolution of censure towards the Lieutenant Governor
                coupled with a resolution white washing the Governor in reference to his action. Now
                there was more or less mixed up in the action of every Senator, an estimate of the
                personal qualities of these men. I must say for myself, that my opinion of the
                personal qualities of these men has changed since I have been here in an official
                capacity, and that will be sufficient for me. The gentleman says we voted for the
                purpose of, in some manner advancing or forwarding the interests of the Democratic
                party. Well, that may be so, but I do not see how we can benefit the Democratic
                party only as we bring disruption upon the Republican party. We have nothing to do
                with the personal fight between these men. It is true the Republicans fell out among
                themselves and showed up their own action, and such action as the people did not
                approve. I believe I voted then as my views indicated, but my official intercourse
                with these men has changed my opinion, and that is sufficient for me to vote to
                expunge these resolutions.

              Mr. HOOPER, when his name was called, said: I desire to say in connection with my
                vote, that in my view of this question it stands-to-day precisely as it stood when I
                voted on the original resolutions;-that so far as the question involved in the
                resolution is concerned, there has been no change. I voted for these resolutions. I
                did so from principle and from no ether motive. While they stand precisely as they
                stood then, I surely cannot change my vote. Several allusions have been made here in
                explanation of votes. One Senator said that his constituents, both Democrats and
                Republicans would sustain him in his vote for this resolution, and that of itself
                would be sufficient. I might say in the same direction that as far as I am concerned
                my constituents, both Republicans and Democrats, will sustain me in the vote I shall
                give on this question, which will be right the reverse of the other. But that does
                not control my action. It is because the situation, as far as these resolutions are
                concerned, is unchanged. The correspondence and
                the facts developed stand precisely where they did; and viewing it in that light, I
                of course, vote in the same direction I did then.

              I trust the Senate will pardon me for alluding to it, but I must allude in passing
                to the position of some of the Senators over the way who are reversing their votes.
                It does seem to me that ihe record was clearly made up upon this question. It will
                not be forgotten that all the facts in the case and the correspondence was before
                us, and the question was freely discussed pro and con. The storm blew over, as it were, and this question was settled. We then
                came to act upon another important question; and that was the election of a United
                States Senator. Then almost to a man they voted for a Republican for the high office
                of United States Senator, and voted for him simply because he had been prominent and
                the main instigator in the management of this case, So the official organ of the
                party came out afterward and placed it upon that ground. But that matters,not as far
                as my duty is concerned. While I have no malice toward any one, and think that it
                does not dispose of enemies either one way or the other, this question was brought
                before us as an abstract question, and it was our duty to pass upon it; and there I
                stand to-day. I have no personal matter against any one-not by any means. I vote
                "no."

              Mr. HUMPHREYS, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said: I am a
                man of few words. I say but little, but think considerable,-sometimes more. I
                confess when this matter came before us last session it did not affect my conscience
                very seriously. I looked upon it merely as a political question the only question 1
                asked was, can we make anything out of it? Whether we continue to make anything out
                of it is a matter of our own decision. At all events we have made all we can; and I
                look upon it now as I did then, as a question of policy; and if we can make nothing
                we take the chances. I therefore vote "aye."

              Mr. JOHNSTON, of Montgomery, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote,
                said: When the original resolutions were up I voted for them, and I am very willing
                to admit I done it with some reluctance. There was one part I did not like to vote
                for, and I am very glad of an opportunity to vote to rescind that resolution. There
                was certain things said to be corrupt and indecent--

              Mr. FISHER (in his seat.) Not in the resolution.

              Mr. JOHNSTON, of Montgomery. Well, in the Senate chamber. My opinion was then and
                is now, and I expect it will continue to be, that the man who instigated the thing
                was the most corrupt and indecent of the two, and hence I vote now to rescind the
                resolution. I vote "aye."

              Mr. KINLEY, when his name was in explanation of his vote, said: I believe I never
                since I have been a member of th^ * ate, cast a merely personal vote. I did not come
                into the Senate with any prejudice against the Lieutenant-Governor or the Governor.
                I voted for the original resolutions and in casting my vote now I shall be governed
                by the same principle I was then. It was simply an abstract proposition. A certain
                letter written by the Lieutenant-Governor to Governor Baker making certain
                propositions. These propositions were or they were not corrupt. I believed they were
                corrupt and the fore voted for the resolutions; and having th same opinion now I am
                compelled to take the same course now I did then. I shall vote " no."

              Mr. LEE, when his name was called, said: I see it is the fashion here for men to
                make explanations of their votes, or give explanations for the changing of their
                votes as I am concerned about the changing of vote it is a very little sacrifice. I
                doubled the propriety of that vote when I gave it; and like the Senator from Green,
                [Mr. Humphreys] I don't see it in any light so that we could make much out of
                it. I had much rather at the time of my vote elected the Lieutenant Governor Senator
                than D. D. Pratt; and if my vote would have done it I would give it to Cumback in
                preference to Pratt. I did not feel, under the circumstances, like voting fop either
                of them, but laying aside prejudice I would vote for Cumback instead of Pratt. I
                have no sacrifice to make whatever, sir, in voting "aye," because I
                doubted the propriety of the vote when I gave it.

              Mr. MORGAN, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote said: At the time
                I was called upon to vote upon this question before, I look upon it and I decided to
                vote as I conscientiously believed was right at the time. I however felt at the time
                I cast my vote that the censure was greater than the crime but I could not see that
                it was not indecent and corrupt, and therefore I had to vote that it was. But I
                would have been very glad at the time if I could have compromised the matter, and
                put it in more decent terms, according to my own views and feelings on the subject.
                I am a very young politician and I had no idea it would have the effect it did have;
                or that it would have caused the injury that it has; and as I endeavor at all times
                when left to myself to try and deal honorably and justly with every person, I feel
                that I can do no better at this time than to vote to expunge these resolutions. As
                for my constituents I care not whether it is in accord with their views and feelings
                or not. They have sent me here and  I expect to
                do exactly what I think is right; and not do any thing I know to be wrong. But that
                I shall always do right; that is another question; or that I may at some times-are
                my endeavors; and I never vote for policy or to please my constituents. I do not
                know how my constituents I belong to the same city with Governor Baker. The Governor
                and myself have always been personal friends, as my votes on record here I believe
                will show. I do not wish do to wrong to one person or another; and from the
                standpoint I now look from, I can do no other way in justice to myself, and in
                justice to all than to vote "aye." 

              Mr. RICE, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said: I approach
                this question with a great deal of pleasure. I have nothing to refer to with regret,
                in my course heretofore. I am glad to hear the feeling expressed, on the part of
                members who voted for the resolutions before, and that they are desiroius of setting
                this matter right as far as it can be.

              As to what the Senator from Jefferson [Mr. Cravens,] said about our having no
                record; it is the first time that ever I knew we had no record; and I never knew
                that our record was destroyed immediately after the adjournment of each session. I
                did not know that the journal of the Senate was destroyed. If that is the case, then
                it is time this Senate was setting about instituting means for preserving that
                record. It is news to me to learn that this Senate has no record. These printed
                volumes on our desks are copies of the journal; and, if the original journal is
                destroyed, however that may be, we are making a record that will go on the sot
                journal, which reflects the sentiment of the Senate, and that is what we are at.
                When you throw these resolutions of censure in our face and in the face of the
                Lieutenant Governor, he will throw back the record for the expunging of those
                resolutions, and that is the point we are trying to make. 

              In reply to the Senator from Whitley [Mr. Hooper,] who says there has been no new
                light shown upon this question, I take it from that, that he has not read the letter
                of Mr. Burson which came in two days after the vote was taken and was published in
                the daily papers, in which he states upon his honor that the general precepts in
                effect came from Governor Baker, and were placed before the Lieutenant Governor so
                as to draw from him a letter. If that was the case, as his subsequent worse
                showed;-he preserved every scrap of a pen; even preventing him from the right of
                making public;-if that was the case, this letter was drawn out and sought for by
                Governor Baker; and after he received it he put it in his pocket; and when the
                letter, asking for its return and stating that an explanation would be made, was
                sent, he hauled off: and I say he is in an infinitely worse position than the
                Lieutenant Governor is. I say there has been new light on this question, And I say
                again I take pleasure in recording my vote "aye."

              Mr. ROBINSON, of Madison, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote,
                said: I wish to say but one word sir. As a matter of course, occupying the position
                I did at the time my vote was cast against these resolutions, I voted at that time
                upon the strength of a longer acquaintance with the Lieutenant Governor, than any
                gentleman upon this floor. It was my fortune to be raised in the County, in which he
                had long lived. I knew his constituents;-I know the confidence they repose in him,
                and I know he could not be guilty of an act, to say the least of it, improper; much
                less dishonorable and corrupt. I voted against these resolutions then and today I am
                gratified to be able to record my vote in favor of this resolution.

              Mr. SHERROD, when his name was called, said : I wish to make a single remark in
                explanation of my vote. With the lights that were before me when the resolutions
                censuring the Lieutenant Governor, were under consideration I voted for them, sir;
                but I am free to admit to-day, having admitted it before, that I voted for those
                resolutions with reluctance. I care not what Senators may say or intimate, or throw
                out intimations as to my motives for the vote I may give. No Senator, sir, has a
                right to impugn my motives. He has no right to hurl to the country the influences
                that he may think are brought to bear to influence my vote. I will not impugn the
                motives of any Senator who may see proper to differ with me upon this or any other
                question. I might make some severe comments, sir, but I shall refrain from doing it
                at this time. I simply wish to give the reason for the vote I am going to give. I
                want to do right, sir, and I want to do justice to all. It has been charged that the
                Lieutenant Governor was guilty of an indiscretion, and so this Senate voted. I
                think, sir, there are degrees in punishment; and I believe somewhere in the
                Scriptures it is said, "Blessed are the merciful." Now, sir, with the
                lights before me to-day, I am convinced, sir, that the impeacher is the man that
                should be impeached. I shall therefore vote "aye."

              Mr. SMITH, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said: It affords
                me a great deal of pleasure to give the vote I am now about to cast. I did not act
                on this thing in a political light. Had I been acting on it as a political matter, I
                should have voted to censure the Lieutenant Governor and thereby distract the
                Republican party, but I had formed my opinion of this under an honest conviction of
                the transaction, and I would have done  an
                injury knowingly to a man I resprct as a gentleman; and although a political
                opponent I take the liberty to say that while the blood courses through my arms I
                will never do wrong to a man because he is politically opposed to me. I did not vote
                for the censure I parted from my political brethren, and they acted for themselves.
                Now it is thrown in our teeth that we voted for a man that took a bold stand for the
                censure of the Lieutenant Governor. I done so under a caucus vote. It was not my own
                free accord, but a vote in accordance with a vote of our caucus; and as I profess to
                be a Democrat, and have been for a long time, and expect to be, I expect to abide
                the action of a Democratic caucus. It is also said that I voted in favor of
                reconsidering those resolutions. * Since I gave that vote I came before my constituents, and
                there was a point made on me in a Republican meeting on that very vote. I attempted
                to tell my Democratic friends what I had done, and gave them the whole circumstances
                as we had it; in effect that the Governor sent a man down to the Lieutenant Governor
                to make a proposition and that he got the proposition, betrayed confidence, broke
                the seal of secrecy put upon it; and that I had voted to sustain the Lieutenant
                Governor, and would do so again: and in all the canvass I made there was never so
                much applause from first to last. I have no fears of my Democratic friends on that.
                And I will say if my election depended on my voting wrong against a man I would not
                do it. In conclusion, I have this to say; it takes this vote of mine to make my
                record a bee line right straight through. I vote "aye."

              Mr. TURNER, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote said: As I
                introduced the original resolution out of which grew the resolutions now upon
                record, and as I voted for them, and as the intimation has been thrown out here,
                that there was inconsistency and stultification proposed by this vote, I deem it
                necessary to give my reasons. On the contrary, sir, instead of being inconsistent
                and instead of stultifying myself by voting to expunge these resolutions, I should
                deem myself stultified if I did not vote to expunge them. While I make this
                declaration, sir, I acknowledge no inconsistency in the vote which I gave in the
                first place for the resolutions. What was the State of the case, sir? The
                representatives of two great pasties in the State of Indiana were assempled here;
                one stung by defeat and the other rejoicing in success. The one in the minority
                having charged upon the party in the majority throughout the late canvass that it
                was reeking with corrup 
                  * NOTE.-Mr.
                  Smith's name should appear in the affirmative vote on page 582, Senate
                  Journal, of the regular session, 1869. tion. "When we came here, a
                part of a ty in power-a fragment of the party party-came forward and charged one of
                its leading members with corruption. Sir, when I introduced that resolution, if it
                had not been backed and if the charge had not came from the party to which the
                Lieutenant Governor belongs no power would have induced me to do so. They brought
                the charge, there was no evidence against it, and there was but one witness that the
                informer. Mr. President we to this man upon trust. His party said he was honest, but
                that this other man was dishonest We took him upon trust, and in all probibility, as
                some have said here, we were influnced by motives of defeating their caucus nominee
                that we might elect some one more favorable. But my vote was put upon trust of this
                the impeaching witness; there being no witness to the contrary, and letters being
                produced having language upon the face of them that indicated in one sentence that
                the Lieutenant Governor felt he was something of a wrong doer in writing it. But the
                Democratic party, or, at least, I for one, acted upon the evidence we had before us
                at that time. Now, sir, what is the state of the case? We have found the man who was
                charged with bein6 corrupt and indecent, sitting in that chair for the last four
                months, eminently qualified and nobly doing always his duty, without stooping for
                party purposes to oppress a minority. And what have we found on the other side, sir?
                We have found the other man stooping to little, low, dirty acts to punish the
                minority. Know, sir, I voted to compliment him in the first place because his party
                said he was anxious and willing to drive corruption out of the Republican party; and
                if we could not defeat him it was to the interest of Democrats to have it made to
                appear that he was anxious and willing to drive out this corruption. We had no other
                evidence no evidence to the contrary, because the hands of one of these men were
                tied. I voted for these resolutions and voted consistently. Now I am here myself
                prepared to impeach the witness upon whose testimony he was condemned; therefore I
                am not inconsistent in voting "aye" for this resolution.

              The vote was then announced as above recorded-yeas 35, nays 8.

              So the resolution was adopted.

              Mr. CRAVENS. Mr. President: I desire to ask for the reading of the resolution just
                passed.

              It was read by the Secretary.

              Mr. CRAVENS. The voice of the Senate las been very decidedly given in favor of this
                resolution; and now in order to show that the point I raised a moment ago was not
                intended to be for anything like captious opposition to he resolution, I move that
                the Secretary proceed to execute the order in the paesence of the Senate. If we have a record I want to see the voice of
                the Senate carried out; if we have not it simply illustrates the folly of the
                resolution.

              Mr. BELLAMY. Does the Chair entertain the motion?

              The PRESIDENT pro tempore. I do not
                suppose the chair could do otherwise.

              Mr. BELLAMY. Then I move to lay the Senators motion on the table. The resolution
                instructs the Secretary to do so, therefore I presume he will without any further
                instructions.

              Mr SHERROD. Will the Senator state-

              Mr. CRAVENS, (interrupting.) Each House Of Congress preserves a journal so that
                they may be referred to in after times. Here has been the custom for time
                immemorial, after the session closes, to have it printed. It is printed under the
                direction of the chief clerks of the two Houses, and when it is so printed I
                understand and have understood for fears, the copy, or, rather, the original, goes
                into waste paper and is no longer preserved here.

              Mr. CHURCH. I rise to a question of order, The Senator made a motion and the
                Senator from Switzerland moved to lay it on the table.

              The PRESIDENT pro tem. The chair
                understands the Senator from Jefferson-

              Mr. CRAVENS. When I desire the accomplished and able Senator from Porter to teach
                me what my duty is, I will let him know.

              Mr. CHURCH. I rise to a question of order.

              Mr, CRAVENS. I have a right to explain the reasons for making my motion, but I am
                very nearly done, so the chair might relieve itself of the necessity of deciding the
                question of order.

              Mr. RICE. If what the Senator states in his explanation is true, and I suppose he
                states the facts, his motion carries in it the seeds of its own destruction. He is
                asking the Secretary of the Senate to do a thing he knows cannot be done. Most
                certainly it is but of order because the order cannot be excuted.

              Mr. CRAVENS. When I made the statement originally the Senator from Parke [Mr. Rice]
                questioned the fact; and I said for the purpose of illustrating and seeing whether I
                was right or not, I would move, as was done in the case of General Jackson in the
                United States Senate, that the Secretary proceed to execute the order. If we have a
                journal let us have it done, and if we have not let us say so.

              The motion to lay on the table, (Mr. Ballamy's) was agreed to.

              Mr. BELLAMY. I move to reconsider the vote taken on the passage of this resolution,
                and I move to lay that motion on the table.

              The latter motion was agreed to. 

            
            
          
          

          

          
            SUPPLEMENTARY TO  THE BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
              VOLUME ELEVENTH.
            The Governor's Action in Regard to the Settlement of
              Certain Old Internal Improvement Bonds----Debate in Continuation.
            IN SENATE.
            
               THURSDAY, April 29, 1839.
            

            [IN CONTINUATION-p. 126.]

             Mr. CARSON offered the following concurrent resolutions:

            BE IT RESOLVED, By the Senate the House of
              Representatives concurring, that the action of the Governor of the State of Indiana,
              and his agent, the Adjutant General, in the settlement of the old Internal Improvement
              Bonds, held by the General Government in trust for certain Indian tribes, referred to
              in his message of 1860, to the General Assembly, was unauthorized by the laws of the
              State of Indiana.

            RESOLVED, That the General Assembly of the State of Indiana should
              make no provision for the payment of principal or interest due, or to become due, on
              the old Internal Improvement bonds, except as provided in the acts of 1846 and 1847,
              known as the "'Butler Bills."

            RESOLVED, That the action of the Governor in the settlement,
              through his agent, the Adjutant General, of $250,000 advanced to Governor Morton by
              the President of the United States, in 1863, was unauthorized by law, and that no
              legislation sanctioning the settlement of the matters embraced in the resolutions and
              referred to by the Governor in his message, as embraced in the report of the Adjutant
              General, should be entertained or proposed by the General Assembly.

            Mr. SCOTT had moved to refer these resolutions to the Committee on Federal
                Relations.

            Mr. CARSON had moved to make these resolutions the special order for this afternoon
              at two o'clock.

            Mr. WOLCOTT had moved to indefinitely postpone the resolutions.

            Mr. CARSON had modified his motion so as to make his resolutions the special order
              for to-morrow afternoon in Committee of the Whole Senate, and
              thereupon-

            Mr. HANNA said :

            Mr. President : I regard the action of the Governor, if acquiesed in by the
              Legislature,as only an entering wedge for the payment of about eight millions of
              dollars-or the entire amount of outstanding old internal improvement bonds. The
              Senator from White [Mr. Wolcott] is trying to repudiate a portion of this debt, and
              trying to sanction the action of the Governor in paying another portion. Why is it
              that a portion of this debt is more sacred than another portion? What kind of justice
              is this? Is it right that the men who had bonds against us and refused to surrender
              them and take the Wabash and Erie Canal and eight thousand acres of land-is it right
              that the men who refused to help us in the time of need shall be paid for it in this
              way? They refused to extend to us a helping hand and now the Governor says that is a
              sacred debt and paid it off in full out of an acknowledged debt of the General
              Government,as the Governor called it "an allowed claim."

            The holders of these bonds refused to assist us-these very men held back and would
              not lend us a helping hand in the darkest hours of 18478and yet the Governor says they
              shall be paid in full, and the Senator from White moves to postpone any proposition to
              inquire into the Governor's conduct. He demands, as a partizan, that we shall not
              investigate this subject at all. He insists that the light of Heaven shall not shine
              upon this dark transaction in which three hundred and twenty thousand dollars of your
              money has been expended without authority! Is that kind of course to be pursued here?
              I want this thing to be investigated, and I want to know if whether it was just and
              right to be done in the manner in which it was done?

            I hope this motion to indefinitely postpone will not prevail. But what else has the
              Governor done? He has employed an agent to transact business for the State without
                author ity - some clerk, perhaps, instrumental
              in preventing the settlement of these claims. He employed him, and promised him forty
              or fifty thousand dollars if he will stand out of the way and let these claims be
              settled! What right has the Governor to do these things? Is fretting himself up as the
              controling power in Indiana? I fancy we have laws here, and if we have no law
              governing this body or the Governor, let him stand out of the way till we make a law.
              The time has passed when one can can control things in the State of Indiana.

            Mr. FISHER, (interposing.) Does not the law of 1865 authorize the Governor to appoint
              agents?

            Mr. HANNA. I asked the Senator, the other day, why this appropriation of five thouand
              dollars to the Adjutant General was made, when I saw him walking about the streets,
              apparently with no business on his hands, and the Senator said it was necessary to
              continue that office to settle up the claims of the State against the General
              Government; and vet we turn to the report, and see that the Governor has hired a man
              for forty or fifty thousand dollars to do the same thing.

            Mr. FISHER. The law fixes the pay of the Adjutant General the same as a Brigadier
              General.

            Mr. HANNA. I see no use for an Adjutant General in Indiana.

            Mr. FISHER. Will the gentleman introduce an act to abolish the office?

            Mr. HANNA. I am not running the Legislature. I am only trying to open a little light
              occasionally on subjects that come up here. I stand here now, asking light upon this
              expenditure of a vast sum of money without authority of law. I ask for the yeas and
              nays upon the motion to indefinitely postpone the matter.

            Mr. FISHER. Mr. President: This matter has got into an interesting condition. The
              Governor thought the passage of a law making any other provision than that
              contemplated in the acts of 1846-7, might compromise the State with regard to that
              whole debt. Here is a party owing us money, and will pay it if we take these bonds.
              The Governor took them. This is not a resolution to approbate the action of the
              Governor, by no means. It is a resolution censuring him, and if you don't censure
              for that the Senator from Sullivan, [Mr. Hanna,] says you lay yourselves liable to pay
              all this great internal improvement debt, and ff you don't censure the Governor
              you show you are in favor of the assumption of this old debt! That is great logic. 

            Mr. TURNER. How can we abrogate the debt? The money is paid over. Have we the power
              to compel the paying of it back?

            Mr. FISHER. I suppose we have not. But what could be done with the General
              Government, when it said to the State: We won't pay you unless you take your
              note-here it is, you may take that or go to the dogs?

            Mr. TURNER. The Government of the United States never refused to pay allowed
              claims.

            Mr. FISHER. Unquestionably it did, unless you allow a set off.

            Mr. TURNER. Our Government had no-authority of law for paying these bonds, even if we
              never get our pay from the General Government.

            Mr. FISHER. Then it would be as it is, with the single exception that the claim of
              the Government would be running on interest and our claim against the Government would
              not. It is a clear, plain case, and the advantage to the State is clear and prominent.
              The power of the Government to do it is a question I am not going to argue at all. I
              am not speaking to approbate the action of the Governor, but what I am speaking about
              is this: While this resolution was introduced for the purpose of censuring the
              Governor, the threat is held over those who might be supposed to approbate the action
              of the Governor, that unless you vote this censure and condemnation upon the Governor,
              you expose the State to the payment of this vast debt. The Senators who make this
              argument understand this as well as we do. They are seeking for political effect, and
              I am willing they should make all the advantage they can of it.

            I would prefer that these resolutions should go to the Committee on Federal
                Relations, as moved by the Senator from Vigo, [Mr. Scott] for to go into
                Committee of the Whole to-morrow will lead to just such a kind of
              discussion as we have got to-day, without the discovery of any new facts, without an
              investigation of the papers, and without really throwing any additional light upon the
              subject. The whole subject should resolve itself into this: Shall these resolutions of
              censure be passed upon Governor Baker, the Democracy contending that if they are not
              this State will have to pay some fifteen millions of dollars of this old Internal
              Improvement debt? Those opposed to these resolutions do not think that the action of
              Governor Baker changes the liability of the State to pay this old debt at all.

            Mr. WOLCOTT. Mr. President: Governor Baker in settling the bonds he settled, in no
              manner affected the bonds canceled under the arrangement of the Butler bill. As
              correctly stated by the Senator from Vigo [Mr. Scott] the two cases stand upon
              different ground. The original bonds as issued were obligations against the State;
              those remaining uncanceled are still obligations against the States.

            The bonds surrendered under the Butler  bill
              ceased to be obligations against the State and the difference between the two classes
              of indebtedness are as different and distinct as it is possible to conceive. The
              action of the Governor in allowing the offset to these bonds, even if recognized by
              the General Assembly, would not affect the question involved in the interest
              represented by the surrendered bonds. It is said the Governor violated the law of
              1847. I deny any violation, by the Governor, of the law of 1847. I will admit the law
              reads:

            PROVIDED, FURTHER, That the State will make no provision whatever
              hereafter, to pay either principal or interest on any internal improvement bond or
              bonds, until the holder or holder? thereof shall have first surrendered said bonds to
              the agent of State, and shall have received in lieu thereof, certificates of stock as
              provided in the first section of this act; any thing in this act to the contrary
              notwithstanding.

            Here in the act of 1865, passed eighteen years after the act of 1847, is an entire
              repetition of the restriction of 1847, because plenary power is given to settle all
              these claims.

            Mr. HANNA (interposing.) I will ask whether that is not the act relating to war
              claims?

            Mr. WOLCOTT. Yes, sir, I will discuss that a little further on. When the Legislature,
              by the act of 1865, empowered the Governor to settle the claims of Indiana against the
              United States, imposing no restrictions against that settlement; anything that was
              legal he had a right to do. These outstanding bonds held by the United States were
              legal obligations of the State to the United States, and under the act of 1865 the
              Governor did that which the act of 1865 expressly authorized him to do. There can be
              no doubt about this question. Why are these series of resolutions introduced? It is
              not confined alone to the action of the Governor in settling these claims; it
              implicates the action of the Republican administration since the war began.

            Mr. CARSON. Will the Senate allow me?

            Mr. WOLCOTT. No; not till I get through. In terms, the resolutions censure not only
              Governor Baker but Governor Morton. I see nothing in these resolutions but a purpose
              to sow discord and confusion among our people. It has been the policy of the
              Democratic party since the fall session began to foment disturbance and discord in the
              Republican ranks, and I believe these resolutions were introduced for no other
              purpose. And I say as Republicans we should vote them down. There is no propriety in
              stirring questions that have been settled for six or seven years; and there is no
              impropriety in what has been done. I say the law of 1847 did not overleap the law of
              1865. But suppose there was a technical objection, and yet the stubborn fact existed
              that the United States Government held claims against the State and refused to settle
              unless we offset the claims. The Governor yielded to these coercive influences -

            Mr. FISHER (interposing.) Every time the State failed to pay the interest on bonds
              the General Government continually withheld a sufficient sum to pay that interest
              with; and a special agent was sent to Washingson during a Democratic administration to
              try and recover that, but failed.

            Mr. WOLCOTT. That is true. The Government always insisted upon its offset. But
              suppose the Governor had not under the Act of 1865, technically, authority to make the
              settlement, and yielded to the demands of fa General Government, yet the claim the
              State of Indiana held against the General Government would five or six times in amount
              offset the claim, and be of great practical service to the State; and if there is any
              responsibility to this matter let it rest with the Governor If he served the State
              usefully by yielding to a pressure he could not control, he is not to blame. If we
              pass it by in silence, as at the last session, then the responsibility rests with the
              Governor and not with the State. These are the reasons I have to give for the course I
              shall pursue upon this question.

            Mr. TURNER. I would like to ask the gentleman a question before he takes his seat. He
              has referred to the fomentation of discord by the Democrats during the session in the
              Republican party, and I will ask him if he does not remember that these identical
              resolutions were presented at the regular session, and that they were smothered by the
              influence of the "Spartan band" and members of the Republican party, on the
              ground of a speech by Judge Hughes, that although the thing was not according to law,
              and we could not give in adhesion to it, the best thing we could do, as we had to
              submit to the condition of things, and could not get our money back, was to maintain
              silence.

            Mr. WOLCOTT. I deny any intention to smother the resolutions. The motion does not
              debar full investigation. After about as full investigation as the subject admits of,
              it was postponed, and let us postpone it again.

            Mr. TURNER. There is no disposition on the part of the Democracy that I know of to
              foment discord in the Republican ranks. We are looking on with complacency at the
              discords they have, without taking a part.

            Mr. CARSON. Mr. President: The Senator asks why these resolutions are brought before
              the Senate at this time? I would reply by asking why the original resolutions were
              introduced and sprung upon this Senate without consideration last session: and why the
              first resolution of that series was adopts without any discussion, indefinitely
              postponing the consideration of this matter? Certainly  that was not by any Democratic tactics or maneuvers. After
              various attempts to discuss the resolutions introduced by Judge Hughes, we failed to
              do it; hence that they might be Trussed the resolutions now before the Senate were
              called forth. That is the history of that transaction. Then it was because we
              apprehended that the action of the Governor committed the people of the State of
              Indiana to an immense liability and a great wrong by an unauthorized act on his part.
              Let us read the first resolution. If it is true it should be adopted ; if not it
              should be rejected.

            Mr. C. read the resolution, as follows:

            Be it Resolved, By the Senate, the House of Representatives concurring, that the
              action of the Governor of the State of Indiana, and his agent, the Adjutant General,
              in the settlement of the old Internal Improvement Bonds, held by the General
              government in trust for certain Indian tribes, referred to in his message of 1869 to
              the General Assembly, was unauthorized by the laws of the State of Indiana.

            Now, will any gentleman on this floor tell me it will not require a great amount of
              investigation for Governor Baker or his friends to show the law by which he settled
              these claims?

            Mr. WOLCOTT (interposing.) Bead section two page forty-nine of the acts of 1865.

            Mr. CARSON. That act recites that the Congress of the United States levied a tax of
              twenty million dollars upon the people of the United States, a certain portion of
              which was to be paid by the people of each state. There was no discretionary power:-no
              law prohibiting the claim. It was a debt in ascertained amount. After reciting the
              facts then it says that Governor Morton permitted the United States to withhold the
              amount. He assumed the responsibility of allowing that claim. I ask is that settling a
              claim in a legal way? Does that form a precedent, for a Governor to settle a claim
              which the State says she shall make no provision for the settlemant of? I take it not
              at all. The first section of that act provides this:

            Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Indiana, That all and singular
              the acts of Oliver P. Morton Governor of the State of Indiana, in the settlement of
              the claims of the State against the United States, for enrolling, enlisting, clothing,
              supplying, arming, equipping, paying and transporting the troops of the State in the
              service of the United States, and in paying and satisfying the State's quota of
              the direct tax laid and levied by Congress on the sixth day of August, A. D., 1861, by
              the due execution of a release or releases to the United States of said claim be, and
              they are hereby, fully and entirely approved.

            Then follows the second section :

            The Governor is hereby authorized to proceed with the settlement of said claims by
              such agent or agents as he may deem necessary, and to file and settle and adjust such
              other claims as may from time to time accrue against the United States, in the same
              manner.

            Now will the Senator from White [Mr. Wolcott] tell me that includes authority for
              thesettlement of the old Internal Improvement bonds?

            Mr. WOLCOTT. The Governor pursued the usual means of settling obligations or
              balancing accounts by mutual obligations.

            Mr. CARSON. The law says " the Governor is hereby authorized to proceed with the
              settlement of said claims;" and " such other claims;" What does that
              mean? "as may from time to time accrue against the United States in the same
              manner." Does that mean the old Internal Improvement claims that the law says the
              State shall never provide for the payment of? That is a lame construction. If that is
              the only authority I think the Senator is prepared to vote upon it now. What is the
              next resolution?

            The next resolution is:

            Mr. C. read the second resolution as follows :

            RESOLVED, That the General Assembly of the State of Indiana should
              make no provision for the payment of the principal or interest due, or to become due,
              on the old Internal Improvement Bonds, except as provided in the acts of 1846 and
              1847, known as the "Butler Bills."

            Now is the Senate prepared to make any other provision? I think not sir. If it does,
              in my humble opinion, it convicts itself of a discernment between creditors. As Judge
              Hanna said: The man that held on to his bonds and refused to assist the State of
              Indiana in our time of need is to receive his dollar for dollar while those who came
              nobly to our aid are to be punished.

            Mr. SCOTT (interposing.) Do you understand that the State is discharged from any
              liability on these unsurrendered bonds because that party refused to come in under the
              Butler bill?

            Mr. CARSON. Suffice it to say it places him as the Senator, and the Governor of the
              State in that condition; and we have no power to relieve ourselves. The Governor could
              not ignore that law and assume the responsibility. He has no other right to act in
              such matters except as authorized by law. He don't make law. He assumed these
              liabilities without authority of law, and he had no more right to than I or any other
              person in the State. The Legislature recognized the act of 1847 as binding. It is in
              the nature of a contract. We were bankrupt then, sir, and are in the condition of a
              bankrupt. And so, when a man compounds with his creditors and some fail to come in
              their claim is considered void.

            What is the next resolution? The question is whether we should or should not make
              provision for the payment of these outstanding bonds. Governor Baker adjusted some
              three hundred and twenty-four thousand dollars, and; here are yet some others
              outstanding held by the Government and in the hands of other persons, but he dare not
              recommend to the Legislature the passing of a law
              providing for the payment of these. If Governor baker settled them as an honest debt
              and paid them off in full, why should he not pay the others? He says he is afraid to
              advise us to make a law to provide for their payment because it might be construed
              into a violation of the act of 1847 and we might commit the State to the
              responsibility for fifteen millions of dollars.

            The third resolution is:

            Mr. C. read the third resolution as follows:

            RESOLVED, That the action of the Governor in the settlement,
              through his agent, the Adjutant General, of $250,000 advanced to Governor Morton by
              the President of the United States, in 1863, was unauthorized bylaw, and that no
              legislation sanctioning the settlement of the matters embraced in the resolutions and
              referred to by the Governor in his message, as embraced in the report of the Adjutant
              General, should be entertained or proposed by the General Assembly.

            Now I call upon the friends of Governor Baker to show me where Governor Morton ever
              said that it was a legal liability against the State of Indiana. If you look at his
              message in 1865 he says it was not; - that the State had nothing to do with it. Then
              why did Governor Baker assume the responsibility? If there is any law authorizing his
              action, Governor Baker ought to be able to furnish that law to his friends. All the
              censure these resolutions pass upon Governor Baker is simply declaring the fact that
              his action in this matter was unauthorized by law. I do not think the friends of
              Governor Baker should be so sensitive when he does an unauthorized act as to reuse to
              tell him so.

            Mr. CHURCH, (interposing.) Suppose the Legislature of this State should authorize the
              Senator from Allen to settle a claim the State had against the Senator from White; and
              the Senator from Allen goes to settle and finds a claim on two millions of dollars
              against the Senator from White and he has a claim of five hundred thousand dollars
              against the State; would the Senator from Allen be unauthorized to settle?

            Mr. CARSON. It depends on the circumstances. I say the State of Indiana had nothing
              to do with this two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. It was no loan to the state.
              She never recognized it. Then why should Governor Baker assume to step in and settle
              Governor Morton's matters with the United States? Governor Morton was in the
              height of his glory and power when the Legislature in settling this matter, what power
              had Governor Baker to step in without authority of law and settle it? If Governor
              Baker had authority to do this act he ought to be able to furnish it to us. These
              resolutions go no farther than to say that the action of Governor Baker was
              unauthorized by law. If this is not so how long will it take his friends to hunt up
              the law by which he could be justified in the act? This is not an intricate matter.
              These things were done unauthorized by law; and Governor Baker never should have paid
              them without authority of law.

            I would like to have this matter set down as the special order for Friday at two
              o'clock p.m., because I cannot be here next week, and as I am the mover of the
              resolutions I would like an opportunity of taking care of them.

            Mr. HANNA. Mr. President: Before the vote is taken I desire to call attention to the
              act passed on the 6th day of March, 1865. It is an act in reference, as it states, to
              the tax of twenty millions of dollars levied by the General Government for war
              purposes. The quota for this State was $904,875.33. Each State had the right, without
              the General Government collecting it to assume payment of it. The Governor and certain
              of the State officers notified the General Government that the State would pay its
              quota; and they held claims against the General Government for equipments furnished to
              an amount sufficient to cover the tax or very near it. These claims had been allowed
              by the General Government, and this act authorized the Governor to proceed with a
              settlement by such agents as he deemed necessary. That is all there is of it. That
              these war claims might be offset against the direct tax; and what else? "He
              should file and settle and adjust such other claims in as may from time to time accrue
              against the United States in the same matter." There is not a word said about
              settling any claims in favor of any Indian tribe. The General Government was not the
              owner of these bonds - an Indian tribe was the owner of these bonds. The General
              Government held them in trust for the Indian tribe.

            Mr. SCOTT (interposing.) Did not the General Government assume the responsibility of
              investing in the first place?

            Mr. HANNA. I don't know what the General Government did. I only view it as a
              legal proposition. It was a naked trust, and no legal right vested in the United
              States. Therefore the Governor had no power except self-constituted power to settle
              these claims. It was not a legal offset against any claims we had against the United
              States.

            Mr. FISHER (interposing.) The Government of the United States had money belonging to
              the Indians, and in its capacity it bought these bonds and held trust, and paid the
              interest annually to the Indians, and had as much control of the bond as if it had
              owned them.

            Mr. HANNA. As a legal proposition, if there was a court competent to try the case,
              they could not have offset these bonds to any claims held by the State against the General government, because the bonds were in
              fact the property of the Indian tribe, and not the property of the United States. I
              refer to this ct of 1865 for this purpose: When I say the governor has been guilty of
              usurpation, you point to this act and say, Here is his authority, I say it don't
              refer at all to the Internal Improvement bonds of the State. It don't remove the
              allegation I make that he is guilty of usurpation and guilty of an act detrimental to
              the interest of the State. Every one knows these claims were not worth ten cents on
              the dollar. Twenty years ago we made provisions for their settlement. The holders of
              these bonds refused to go into that arrangement, and these bonds had not been
              recognized as a legal obligation from that day to this. True, the Government has, per
              force, withheld the three per cent., and these bonds have been expensive to the people
              of the State, and are made still more so by the act of Governor Baker. How is it with
              the one hundred and ninety-six thousand dollars outstanding? We have never paid
              interest on them, and the holders have never pretend-to take any process to recover.
              They were no more than waste paper.

            Mr FISHER (interposing.) I would like to ask the Senator if an individual holding one
              or more of these bonds should become indebted to the State, and suit was commenced by
              the State, whether his bonds could not be offset as against the indebtedness?

            Mr. HANNA. In answer I will say that the United States did not hold any bonds of this
              State in a condition that they could be used as an offset. It held the bonds as a
              naked Trustee. They were no more than waste paper.

            Mr. WOLCOTT. If your proposition be true does not this follow: that Governor Baker
              has made no settlement at all, and we still owe the Indians these bonds?

            Mr. HANNA. I say he has not settled, for he has no authority to do so; but he has
              satisfied a claim we held against the United States. I say the act of 1865 gave him
              authority to settle only a certain tax, and that we have received no consideration for
              the settlement in question here. Your Governor has usurped authority to do a thing you
              did not confer upon him the right to do, and now the General Government will hold us
              to that contract; and We want to say to that man that he has transcended his
              authority. And that is all I want to say.

            Mr. FISHER. It is understood that the general Government is indebted largely to the
              State of Indiana. Does the Senator suppose she will pay that debt without using other
              bonds of the same kind she holds? When the a Government refuses to pay unless these
              bonds are taken as an offset, how are you going to remedy that evil?

            Mr. HANNA. If you want the Governor to settle these bonds pass an act giving him
              authority to do so. Let him act according to law but never suffer an officer to usurp
              authority. That is the point that I am driving at. I want to meet at the door-step any
              attempt of the executive to spend the money of the people without authority. Let the
              voice of the people be heard, and let not an Executive officer undertake to override
              the law and the Constitution.

            Mr. CRAVENS. Mr. President: I know of no nobler sentiment expressed by any leader
              than that expression of Junius that it was as base in an individual to hear a worthy
              man abused without attempting his justification, as it is to be the author of the
              calumny against him. I suppose the purpose of these resolutions is as apparent as that
              immense flood of light just let in upon us by a puncture of the heavens. There cannot
              be much difficulty m recognizing it as an organized and intended raid upon the present
              Executive of the State. That I apprehend to be the great purpose of this discussion;
              and I am warranted in saying, so, when I recall the sentiments expressed by the
              recognized leader of the Democracy on this floor-the Senator from Sullivan [Mr.
              Hanna.]

            Mr. HANNA (in his seat.) I deny any leadership.

            Mr. CRAVENS. I merely assert the leadership. The Senator from White, at the
              commencement of the session, introduced an amendment to the Constitution, which
              declared that the State shall never do any act looking to the redemption of, or
              liability on account of the Wabash and Erie Canal. It was objected to on the ground
              that if the debt incurred la that matter was not a debt-an existing debt-there was no
              necessity for it; and if it was a debt, that proposed Constitutional amendment was
              simply an act of repudiation. I believe the Senator from Sullivan [Mr. Hanna]
              introduced that argument and would say upon his, reputation as a lawyer that this
              great debt was. a debt upon the State and had been for years-and he was in favor of
              repudiating that debt and also the General Government debt.

            Mr. HANNA (interrupting.) I guess the Senator misunderstood me. I said it was a
              legally existing debt or not; if it was not, then the amendment to the Constitution
              was unnecessary; if it was we could repudiate it; and for myself I favored repudiation
              not only of that but of all---

            Mr. CRAVENS. Then why censure the Governor of the State for having acted under
              authority given him by the Legislature? Why censure him for doing the very thing the
              people of Indiana declared he should do?-settle these claims? 

            

             He spoke at length in justification of the action of the Executive of the State in
              the matters questioned by the resolutions under consideration.

            When he had concluded-

            The Senate took a recess till two p. m.

            Subsequently, the pending motion to infinitely postpone Mr. Carson's resolutions
              agreed to-yeas 20, nays 17. 

          
          
          

          
            SUPPLEMENTARY TO THE BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS
              VOLUME ELEVENTH.
            Appropriation for the Soldiers and Seamen's Home, at
              Knightstown ---- Debate in Continuation.
             IN SENATE.

            
               THURSDAY, May 6, 1809.
            

            [IN CONTINUATION-p. 169-FIRST
                COLUMN.]

             Mr. Hess' bill [S. 246] to amend
              sections 4, 13 and. 15 of an act entitled "An act to establish a home for the
              maintenance of sick and disabled Indiana soldiers and seamen, and their orphans and
              widows," approved March 11, 1867, and supplementary to said act being the special
              order for this hour (ten o'clock a. m.)-

            Mr. HADLEY said: 

            Mr. President: I had hoped that there was no necessity for any remarks on this bill.
              But from some remarks made by one or two Senators, I am induced to ask the indulgence
              of the Senate for few moments. The main features of this bill are but two: the one
              increasing the allowance for children from one and a half to two dollars a week ; and
              the second is giving the power to Trustees to indenture the children as fast as they
              can find good homes for them.

            Now, Mr. President, we are professing to the world that we are doing a great work for
              humanity and charity in the way of maintaining a home for soldiers and their orphans
              at Knightstown. We have there a magnificent structure with lofty tower; with garnished
              walls, spacious halls and well furnished apartments, yet when we to and examine into
              that institution we find that we are half starving the inmates upon the coarsest
              provisions-upon an allowance of one dollar and a half a week. I hope the Senate will
              consider this matter one foment. An allowance of one dollar and a half for each
              inmate, and this includes their subsistence, their clothing, their fuel, their school
              books; the salaries of teachers and all subordinate employes of the Institution, which
              reduce the item of subsistence to about fifty cents per week; an amount that would not
              feed your horse or hog two days at the present high prices.I insist that it is a
              disgrace to the State of Indiana, to be making this pretence in the direction-in the
              way of charity-and yet starve the inmates of this institution upon this pititul
              allowance. 

            I insist that this institution must be abolished or we must make more liberal
              provisions. And we cannot abolish it; we must not abolish it. It is not a question of
              pleasure; it is not a question of expediency; but it is a question in which the honor
              of the State is involved. If these children had lost their natural protectors by
              natural causes, even then the State would be under moral obligations to protect and
              educate them, teach them agriculture and industry, and prepare them to be useful
              citizens; but, sir, these children deserve a preferred protection and a preferred
              sympathy from the State.

            But a few years ago, sir, these children had happy and prosperous homes of their own;
              they had comfortable homes, and they had fathers to love and to provide for them, and
              to protect and shield them from the abuses of the world. They had fathers whose then
              ambition it was to inculcate into their young minds the principles of truth and
              humanity. Then they were happy and prosperous. But we had armies to raise and battles
              to fight. We had families to break up; fathers to sacrifice; children to orphanize;
              and the fathers of these children were the unfortunate victims of that war. These
              children are here to-day asking us for a mere pittance-asking us to furnish them with
              provisions and clothing and a school master. These orphan children whose plaintive
              voices are waited upon the breezes to this Capitol from more than twenty  poor houses in this State, are imploring us to reclaim
              them from the disgraceful and demoralizing associations of the poor houses. For the
              sake of the honor of the State and the cause in which their fathers died they are
              asking us to redeem them from that disgraceful state and give them a respectable
              home.

            Is there a Senator here-is there a taxpayer in all the length and breadth of this
              State who will sit with his own happy family about him, and in the midst of his
              property, much of which has grown up out of the blood and bones of the soldiers; I say
              is there a man in all this State so hampered, so stingy, so ungrateful that he would
              decline to give the miserable pittance of eight cents-eight cents out of every
              thousand dollars of his property to furnish these two hundred orphans with homes at
              Knightstown? This is all they ask. They are not asking us to return them their
              fathers. They have been taken from them by the State. They are not asking us to make
              compensation for the great loss they have suffered, but simply for a home and a school
              master. If there is a man that has a single impulse of humanity about him, and persist
              in refusing to pay this-I say to him shame! shame!

            Other States, Mr. President, have recognized their obligations to these children. The
              State of Iowa, sir, a State which has a much less population than we, and of course,
              fewer soldier's orphans than we, is to-day taking care of and educating eight
              hundred and thirty-three soldier's orphans at an expense to the State of more
              than eighty thousand dollars. The State of Ohio has an institution in every county in
              the State for the protection and education of these children. A little farther east,
              Pennsylvania is taking care of and educating three thousand four hundred and
              thirty-one soldier's orphans at an expense to the State of two dollars and
              sixty-five cents per week; which in the aggregate, amounts to about half a million of
              dollars. Here on our northern border is the State of Michigan;-that noble exemplar
              State-she is taking care of her soldier's orphans at an expense to the State of
              three dollars and a half per week. And, sir, is it possible that Indiana cares less
              for her soldiers than her neighboring sister States? Is it possible that we care less
              for our honor as a State? Is it possible that we have less respect for our obligation?
              Are we less able to pay, or less willing to pay? If any Senator says we are he does
              not feel aright the pulse of the people of Indiana.

            Then, Mr. President, a little further. I will ask Senators, sir, to lay open the
              volumes yes, the volumes in which are recorded the one hundred pledges made to
              soldiers to induce them to leave their wives and children and go out into the army and
              fight the battles of their country. I ask Senators individually, and particularly
              those who did not go into the army to carry these questions home with them. A few
              years ago-in 1862-3 did you not like every body else, agree with your neighbor act
              with your neighbor in pledging your sacred honor to those soldiers that if they would
              go out into the war and leave you at home that their children-their wives and children
              should be protected and liberally provided for until they returned? Senators,
              don't you know these pledges were made? Don't you know if they had not been
              made our vast armies would not have been volunteers? Don't you know sir, if you
              had said to the soldiers that if they got killed in the army, their wives should go
              ragged and their children unfed; don't yon know that if you had said to them you
              would only allow their children the miserable pittance of one dollar and a half a
              week; don't you know if you had said these things, there would not have been
              money enough in all the counties to have paid out of the draft?

            And now, sir, while these facts are so clear-so patent-I say again, the State cannot
              afford, through her legislators here to do such violence to her honor as to repudiate
              its obligation to these children before the grass has grown over the graves of their
              fathers. I do not believe, sir, that Senators are ready to do it. I do not believe,
              sir, that Senators will say here to-day by their votes that we owe nothing to these
              children-that we are not under special obligations to soldier's orphans. But,
              sir, if there should be such an one I say to such an one, Go first and commit to the
              flames every volume in which is recorded a history of the late war; for every such
              book will stand as a monument, more enduring than brass, to your infidelity to the
              soldiers.

            A few months ago I had the pleasure in common with many of you to visit this home at
              Knightstown: and, sir, as I looked over the assembled children there, and saw their
              hair all combed so nicely, and their faces all so clean, and their garments all so
              neat and comfortable, with cheeks so red and eyes so bright, I thought I never had
              seen as large a company of children apparently so healthy, happy and cheerful. And,
              sir, I felt proud-proud, I say, to think that I was a citizen of the State, and a
              representative in a State that was so nobly and honestly discharging its duty in this
              matter. And when I had occasion in _the course of a few remarks addressed to these
              children, to refer to the fact that they were the wards of the State, and inasmuch as
              they had lost their fathers by war they should not thereby lose a home, their young
              hearts seemed to swell with gratitude and ambitition to become useful men and women.
              Now Senators, are you going to crush their young hopes before they are fully fledged?
              Are you going to cask  them out into the streets
              and highways to beg the street corners and at the church doors? Are you going to drive
              them into the poor houses, and have their young minds and hears corrupted by the
              vicious associations of these places? Sir, I will never believe it.

            Then, again, it has been urged upon this floor that it is a bad thing to have these
              children congregated over there to raise them up in idleness? I wish to correct that
              impression. It is very far from the facts in the case. Instead Of raising these
              children in idleness we propose to teach them industry:-that is one the particular
              objects of the institution-not the commonest and meanest drudgery; but honorable
              labor-we propose to teach the boys lot only to learn from books, but take them into
              the fields and teach them how to plant potatoes and other vegetables; to chop wood,
              and do all the multifarious labors of the farm. And the little girls not only kitchen
              duties but to use the needle in making their own garments and garments for the boys.
              It is not founded in truth when it is said we propose to raise them in idleness.

            Again, it has been urgued that the association of both sexes there was all wrong:
              that it would lead to evil consequences. I hurl back such charges as being a slander
              upon the reputation and character of those having the institution in charge. The State
              of Indiana does not propose to employ officers at that institution who would suffer
              any thing of the sort.

            Then again, I will not occupy your time but one moment more. This matter has now
              assumed a tangible and matter of fact shape, and the question arises who are the
              friends of the soldier? The soldier has the right to command the votes of the
              Republican party. They have a right to command them, for the Republican party has
              always professed to be a friend of the soldier.

            Mr. MORGAN (interposing.) I would like to ask the Senator if they have not the right
              to command the same thing of the Democratic party?

            Mr. HADLEY. I will come to that in a moment if the Senator please. I was going to add
              that the soldiers have the right to corned the votes of the Republican party, for have
              always professed to be their friends. have voted with the Republican party - elected
              Republicans to office, and they have a right to command their votes. The Democratic
              party of this Senate has also professed to be friends of the soldier; and I have no
              doubt they are. There is no question in my mind that they feel as friendy and grateful
              towards the soldiers as the Republican party. It was manifested here at the last
              regular session when they desired to vote out of the public treasury one hundred
              thousand dollars to place worthless babules [certificates to be signed by the Governor
              and countersigned by the Adjutant General, commemorating the services and achievements
              of Indiana, in the late war of the rebellion] in the hands of every soldier in the
              State; and now I have no right to doubt but that they were acting in good faith. There
              is no question but they were acting in candor and sincerity, desiring to acknowledge
              the services soldiers had rendered to the State; and to-day comes an opportunity to
              verify that action. Then it was in a shape that no matter if it had carried, no monies
              could have been appropriated. To-day, if you pass this bill money will be
              appropriated. It will cost you something; it will cost your constituents something;
              and, allow me to assure you, the soldiers will receive it as a much higher compliment
              to take care of their comrades children than to place a worthless bauble in their
              hands that many would not care to carry from the post office. I call upon the army of
              two hundred thousand soldiers of the State of Indiana to witness the voting to-day
              upon this measure, and there find out who are their real friends. The test comes
              to-day; and I say it in no manner of threat, but I say I call upon them to witness
              because the stern facts present themselves to-day, and they cannot be avoided.

            Mr. SHERROD. Mr. President: No man will go further than I to make provisions for the
              soldier's orphan where the necessity demands, but I am opposed to this bill on
              principle. I opposed the bill proposing an appropriation of money to the
              soldier's home last session and the session before the last. Now, sir, I do not
              want to consume the time of the Senate in making a speech, but I think we have gone
              far enough in this direction. The National Government has prepared liberally for the
              comfort of our disabled soldiers. I do not want to detail before the Senate the facts
              I have in connection with this soldiers' home, coming from our disabled soldiers
              who have been inmates of that institution. I refrain from it from the fact that I do
              not want such facts to go before the public. I oppose it on principle. I shall vote
              against the bill.

            Mr. TURNER. Mr. President: By a resolution adopted this morning, and the special
              Joint Committee which visited the Dayton Home believing the National Home there to be
              the proper one for our soldiers, I have concluded, under these circumstances that I
              would not support this bill. As far as these children are concerned, I believe that in
              my section of the State not one single child has had any benefit of that Knightstown
              Home. In my County, we take care of them at home, and in handsome style. And we are
              not likely to derive any benefit from it in the future for the reason that these
              children do not like to be transported so far; and we want to take care  of our own little ones. And while taking care of them they
              belong to all of us; they are mine and yours and those of the citizens of every county
              in which they reside. While we are doing that we don't want to pay the expenses
              of taking care of the orphan children of three or four counties located in the
              vicinity of the Soldiers' Home.

            Mr. HAMILTON. Mr. President: I thought it would not be necessary to say much in
              regard to this bill; but I want to refer to one thing mentioned by the Senator from
              Orange as he seemed to turn his main argument to the fact that the State had made an
              appropriation for this institution. Now I do not know but that it would be a wise
              proceeding on the part of this General Assembly even if we had no soldiers'
              orphans to carry out this thing instead of sending the unfortunate children of our
              State to the poor house where they are raised up in ignorance and have no moral
              influences thrown around them. If we had no orphans of soldiers in this State it would
              be a wise thing as far as the State is concerned, to have some place to send orphans
              to, where they would be trained morally and physically and educated and prepared for
              usefulness. Suppose we take a child who has been reared in a county house, (and I
              suppose my county has as respectable an one as any,) but is that child prepared for
              usefulness, or prepared to make a living when it comes away? Is it a fact that we
              propose to send the children of our soldiers, who have sacrificed their lives in
              defence of our country to the poor houses ? I would say that some of these children,
              and probably a considerable portion, have neither father nor mother. I was shown some
              of that class when I was up at the Home; and the resolution we have adopted this
              morning says that we will not receive any more soldiers there, but we will take the
              soldier's orphans. There we propose to take care of them; and when they get to a
              proper age see that they get respectable places. We propose to train them up to be
              useful and fit them to fill their places in the world. Public opinion thinks there is
              something not creditable in the idea of going into a poor house; and by sending these
              children up here they are saved from whatever discredit is attached to the inmates of
              our county houses. I hope we will not press this subject so as to look at it from a
              political stand point. If we profess a love for the soldier this is a good and
              practical way to carry it out.

            Mr. TURNER. Mr. President: I did not wish my remarks to be comprehended in that way.
              There are four or five hundred soldier's orphans in the county where I reside,
              and probably one-fourth as many widows. There was but one instance that came under my
              knowledge where any went to the county poor house, and that was a choice in preference
              to coming to this soldier's home. And I wish to state that if they needed some
              place to go to; having provided for them as we have with a great large, fine house,
              under the best kind of superintendence; that nineteen out of twenty would make the
              choice to go upon that farm Under its management, and a liberal management it is, they
              would make it their choice in preference to going to this soldiers' home.

            Mr. HAMILTON. Mr. President: I had no reference to his remarks, but I now have; and
              would like to ask the gentleman if it would cost that county any more to support this
              one up here than that institution in their own county?

            Mr. TURNER. It will, for the reason that we carry on that establishment on a high
              scale upon a liberal scale and intend to for all time to come; and as a matter of
              course as we have arranged to provide for them the few that might make the choice to
              go here would not make that establishment any less expensive to us; and we would be
              paying our tax to support this establishment up here while taking care of our own
              orphans at home.

            Mr. HAMILTON. I don't see that that answers the question. I am sure the smaller
              the parcels are divided out the larger the expense will be. I do not suppose that we
              are going to compel children to go to our home. I am told that there has already been
              some 200 applicants for admission, and they only await the assurance of the
              Legislature that they will be received. Having abandoned this institution in one
              sense, as a home for the soldier. there will be no other expense incurred by admitting
              the orphans than that incident to occupying the rooms and the expenses of taking care
              of them; and I think it too plain to call in question that it would cost less to have
              a large portion together than to parcel them out. Believing as I do that this measure
              will certainly prevail I do not feel like detaining you all. Two dollars and fifty
              cents a week is less than we maintain our own children at home.

            Mr. HANNA. Mr. President: At the commencement of the regular session I gave some
              reasons against congregating children together and attempting to raise them in that
              way. I believe yet it is bad policy for the State to pursue that course in reference
              to these children. It is due from the State to extend protection to all its
              inhabitants; and that protection is extended by the enactment of just laws, and by
              providing channels of industry and just remuneration for labor; but whenever you
              undertake to single out a class of inhabitants, and say that class shall have special
              privileges above others, you do wrong. You have lived long enough to see soldiers and
              orphans homes,  but those in the revolutionarry
              war, and in the last war with Great Britain, and in the Indian lair, and in the war
              with Mexico had no such Institutions created for them;-this kind of Public provision
              was not made for them. It may be necessary in countries where the population
              overcrowds, to furnish channels of industry for certain classes, and it may be
              possibly done, but in a country like this whose wealth and vastness provides channels
              of industry for every inhabitant, I very much doubt the propriety of such institutions
              for any class. It is utterly impossible, and we can't shut our lives to to the
              fact, to provide soldiers' homes for all the orphans of the soldiers in the
              State, or all the destitute orphans; we can't do it. We would have to build a
              soldier's home in every county in the State to do it. If you build one here it
              becomes a local institution for the surrounding counties. The inhabitants of Daviess
              county will send none; and Sullivan county will send none, although we have a large
              number of that class. And why? Because the distance that intervenes is so great that
              the amount it would take to send them there would provide for them for half a year;
              and there are very few of these orphans but have relations either of consanguinity or
              affinity, who feel such an interest in their welfare as to provide some kind of a home
              for them.

            Mr. HAMILTON (interposing. I would like to ask this question: While I think, as far
              as humanity is concerned, we owe to all orphans the duty of taking care of them; but
              are we not under some obligations to take care of that peculiar class who were made so
              by their father's falling in the defence of this country?

            Mr. HANNA. If you undertake to draw a distinction I would draw a finer line and
              discriminate between the orphans of those who went into the army for money-for the
              purpose of robbing-and the men who went through loyalty.

            Mr. HAMILTON. I will ask another question: Do I understand you to brand the soldiers
              with having gone for money?

            Mr. HANNA. I don't brand any of them; but I know some went as substitutes--

            Mr. HAMILTON. That is a small proportion.

            Mr. HANNA. I do not know how many, but it is a line of distinction; and if the
              Senator wants to draw lines of distinction between orphans of any class let him draw
              it a little finer-in favor of the orphans of men who vent in out of patriotic motives.
              We have amongst us orphans of men who have offered UP their lives on railroad cars for
              the public good; but these kind of distinctions are pretty hard to draw. It is a
              pretty thing to talk about patriotism and all that kind of a thing.

            There is the declaration of the Senator from Clinton [Mr. Hamilton.] He asked whether
              I would make a distinction or not; and he declares that there are hundreds of
              applicants turned away from the Soldier's Home because there is no certainty of
              an appropriation. We have appropriated ten or fifteen thousand dollars in a bill
              already passed; but you now propose to appropriate by indirection an indefinite
              sum-any sum those in authority there may see proper to draw.

            Mr. HADLEY (interposing.) We have made no doubt ample appropriation, but under
              existing laws it can be drawn only at the rate of one dollar and a half a week.

            Mr. HANNA. The effect of the bill will be this; suppose they take in: how, many? One
              or two thousand-

            Mr. HADLEY (interrupting.) The institution would not accommodate more than two
              hundred and fifty.

            Mr. HANNA. There is the injustice of the thing. You select out two hundred and fifty
              and all the others are turned away. Now the truth is that soldiers' Home is a
              flittering generality about which men make cheap popularity. You can't provide
              for one tenth or one twentieth of the soldiers orphan's in the State.

            Mr. HAMILTON (interposing.) If I was a man of his size I would have broke down long
              ago carrying popularity. [Laughter.] I am not looking for that.

            Mr. HANNA. It may break me down, but I am not seeking it. I never do any thing for
              popularity. I do what I think is right-what justice requires, and let the result take
              care of itself. The people look to these things to see where the right is. A poor,
              worthy citizen dies, and his wife is left a helpless widow with a lot of orphans, and
              you say "We have no charity to extend to you;" but here is another man on
              the other side of the way who dies and we take his children and take care of them.
              This is drawing a line of distinction that the people cannot draw. If you do
              inaugurate this system of taking care of orphans, you have got to inaugurate it upon a
              much larger scale than this. You have got to provide for more of them, or you cannot
              get my support. If you will go into statistics and show me how many destitute orphans
              there are in the State who ought to receive this protection and make provision for
              admitting all of them, then I will give it my support. But when you propose to support
              one out of every twenty and there we will stop; then I say that unjust discrimination
              does not meet with my approbation. But at the foundation lies an objection to
              congregating children together and undertaking to raise them up in great bodies.

            Mr. GRAY. Does the General Government do right in making a distinction?

            Mr. HANNA. I don't know what distinction 
              the General Government makes. But I suppose this Soldiers' Home was intended to
              be a temporary institution. It is for us to determine whether it shall be or not, and
              now is the time to determine it. For when once fastened upon us there is no getting
              rid of it. Whenever there is a leak in the public treasury; that leak never gets any
              smaller.

            Mr. HADLEY. By the passage of this bill empowering the trustees to indenture these
              orphans as fast as homes can be found for them, they will go out very fast. I do not
              believe there are more than two hundred and fifty destitute soldier's orphans in
              the State.

            Mr. HAMILTON. There is a class whose fathers and mothers are both dead. I made a
              great many war speeches, and pressed men to go to war, and pledged myself if they
              should be so unfortunate as to fall while standing between me and the enemies of the
              country, I would look after their children's welfare when they were not here; and
              I am here to fulfill that obligation.

            Mr. CHURCH. Mr. President: There is no politics in this matter. This institution is
              on our hands and this bill is simply calculated to provide for what we have, on our
              hands now. I do not want to perpetuate this thing. I want to get rid of it as soon as
              we can. But these children are there, and the question is whether we shall disband
              them. The probability is that for two years to come we have got to have that
              institution; and the question comes up shall we give them enough to be respectable. I
              think we ought to vote upon it and while we must keep them running for two years, give
              them enough to keep it running respectably. I do not see any use for hifalutin. These
              children are now needing this thin The child that to-day needs help, in two years may
              be able to help itself. The soldier that died five years ago is not likely to have
              children under five years of age.

            Mr. TURNER (interposing.) The Senator has correctly said that there is no politics in
              the matter. It is a mere matter of charity And the Senator is right when he says we
              are under obligations to take care of these children; but if the Senator will follow
              out his remarks and so amend the bill that this institution is to cease in two or
              three years there is not one of us that would have any objection to voting supplies to
              children now there.

            Mr. CHURCH. I would have but little objection to having a thing of that kind in this
              bill. I would encourage the diminution of numbers all the time. But at the end of two
              years may we not judge as well as now about the necessity of this institution?-Four at
              the outside? This being the case, I believe the Senate has talked all they want to and
              I move the previous question.

            The Senate seconded the demand for the previous question and under the operation
              thereof the bill passed by yeas 30, nays 10.

              VOLUME ELEVENTH.
            Location of the Indiana Agricultural College ---- Mr. Dunn's
               Bill, H. R. 347, --- Debate in Continuation.
            HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.

            
              TUESDAY, April 27, 1869.
            

             [EVENING- SESSION p. 119-FOLLOWING Mr.  OSBORN p. 141 to 145.]

            Mr. BUSKIRK, (Mr. Welborn in the chair) following Mr. Osborn, said:

            Mr. Speaker: I did not propose to take up much time in the discussion of this
              question, for the reason that the matter has been heretofore considered in debate, and
              I presume every member has made up his mind how he will vote. And what I have to say
              to night will be in reply to what I consider a severe attack by the gentleman from
              Putnam and Hendricks [Mr. Osborn.] This matter was discussed at length during the last
              session and by courtesy of the House I had an opportunity to present the claims of the
              State University; and the interests of Putnam county also represented in that debate
              by her distinguished Representatives [Mr. Neff and Orborn.] But the gentleman
              complained of the Special Committee.

            Mr. OSBORN (interposing.) What I complained of was, that the Committee did not let me
              know of the time of its action on this matter, and that the Committee did not know
              Putnam county was asking for the location.

            Mr. BUSKIRK. Neither have the Committee or the House yet learned that Putnam County
              is asking for this location.

            Mr. OSBORN. Then I will now inform louse of the fact.

            Mr. BUSKIRK. And if the gentleman was acting in good faith when he moved to out
              "Monroe County," why he did not propose insert "Putnam County" in
              lieu? But he did not do it. Hence, it seems to me, that,if his County's
              proposition has been ignored, it is because it was not considered worthy of attention.
              But, what does he do? He moves to strike out "Monroe County," and the
              "State University," wherever they occur in the bill, and insert-nothing-not
              Putnam County not Marion County not Tippecanoe-not Hancock; because he would combine
              opposite the claims of the county of Monroe. 1 understood the gentleman's tactics
              very well. If his county is asking for this location in good faith, why not try its
              merits and come here upon its own strength? instead of arraying an opposition and
              making an attack upon Monroe county which I think is wholly unwarranted?

            In the first place the gentleman tries to complain of the action of the Committee. In
              my judgment the Committee has but done its duty, as the Chairman [Mr. Ratliff] has
              stated. There were but three propositions before the Committee: That of the original
              bill [Mr. Dunn's H. R. 347] locating the institution with the State University,
              and the propositions from Mr. Purdue and Tippecanoe county. I must differ with the
              Chairman when he says no other proposition was talked about; but they did not consider
              others because they were not referred to them. And I presume there is not a member of
              this House so utterly ignorant of parliamentary law as not to know a Committee has no
              right to consider a proposition that has not been referred to them. But the gentleman
              said he was not notified of the meeting of the Committee. I do not understand that it
              is the duty of the Committee to go around and notify gentlemen that they are going to
              meet. And I understand that this Committee determined upon their report after two
              evenings session.

            

            Mr. OSBORN (to Mr. Buskirk.) Was you notified?

            Mr. BUSKIRK. No sir. It was by the merest accident that I met and remained with the
              Committee. And, if I mistake not, the gentleman [Mr. Osborn] himself was in the House
              about the same time. The gentleman says he had no notice as to where the Committee
              would meet, I presume, if the gentleman had been in his place at the time, he would
              have heard the announcement. The first motion in these proceedings was, that the bill
              be referred to the Committee on Education. Then the gentleman from Grant [Mr. Ratliff
              ] moved that it be referred to a Special Committee of one from each Congressional
              District. The amendment prevailed, and its mover, in the usual way, was first named on
              the Committee. And, as I remember the Chairman said he had to notify the gentleman
              from Marion [Mr. Stanton,] and that he need not notify the gentleman from Putnam
              without Putnam was competing for the location. It seems then, either that Putnam was
              not competing, or she had not very strong claims.

            The gentleman says the report of the Special Committee establishing this College in
              connection with the State University took the House by surprise. Why, sir, Monroe
              County has been asking and competing for this location ever since the grant was passed
              by Congress. It has been notorious, that on this floor-perhaps the remark should be
              confined to this House-we had as much strength as any other point. Then how could the
              House be taken by surprise? I think the gentleman was about as wide of the mark in
              this, as in many other statements he has made on this question.

            The gentleman says that the Committee was in great haste to make their report. They
              certainly were in no greater haste here, than we were at the last session, when days
              and weeks were occupied with this matter. It has been over five years since the
              question was first agitated here. It was in 1864 and '65 that Monroe County made
              her application here. Instead of hurry, I think there has been delay for which the
              Legislature is not excusable in this matter.

            The gentleman took up considerable time in the discussion of location, and attempting
              to show that the General Assembly has riot the right to locate this Institution with
              any other Institution. I will not weary the House with the discussion of this
              allegation. It is a grand discovery which the gentleman has made without any
              preparation! He comes in with authorities and books piled upon his desk, (but still
              without preparation,) to show that this House has not the power to locate this
              Agricultural College with any other Institution. But I say I will not weary the House
              upon this subject, for it has been fully discussed here time and again. Still, it is
              very singular, that it has been left for the from Putnam and Hendricks, to make
              discovery, when it is notorious that the States of Pennsylvania, New York, and almost
              every other State of the Union-some 12 States out of the 16 that have accepted this
              National dowment-the States of Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, I believe-I
              can't mention every State by name without a list of them but some twelve of them
              have located their Agricultural Colleges in connection with other Institutions.

            I will read here an extract from the lately printed speech of Prof. Daniel Bead
              before the General Assembly and the people of Indiana, which will suffice for
              this:

            If you unite the two funds by making the proposed College a department of the
              University, you can at once expend every dollar coming from the grant, upon the
              strictly Agricultural and Mechanical arts: if you attempt to make it a separate
              institution, you must expend most of the fund to proving elementary instruction-the
              very institution which you now have in the University Hence those State which adopt
              the wisest educational policy, having turned over this fund to create or support a
              department in an existing institution which already affords much of the instruction
              required. Thus Connecticut has given her share of this bounty to the Sheffield
              Scientific School, which is a Department of Yale, Rhode Island has given hers to
              supper a Scientific school in Brown University. Vermont unites hers with the endowment
              and scientific collections of Vermont University. New Hampshire forms such a
              connection with Dartmouth as to make the new institution essentially a department of
              that institution. Massachusetts alone of all the States, divides the fund, giving
              one-third to the school of Technology at Boston, already having large endowment, and
              the remainder to the Agricultural School at Amhurst, which enjoys all the advantages
              of Amherst College. New Jersey gives her portion to establish a Scientific School in
              connection with the New Brunswick College. New York unites her whole share arising
              from nine hundred and ninety thousand acres with the immense Cornell endowment.
              Kentucky and Wisconsin give their portion of the grant to their State Universities.
              While Pennsylvania, Maryland, Michigan an Iowa, give theirs to Agricultural Colleges
              which have been established before the grant was made.

            Yet the gentleman from Putnam argues gravely, that this cannot be done.

            Mr. OSBORN. Did not Kentucky first establish her Agricultural College, and then
              attach the National endowment?

            Mr. BUSKIRK. I do not know. And, sir, I do not care whether you attach this College
              to the University, or the University to the College. I want them united, as Colleges
              of the Indiana University. I would remark, that the people of Monroe County and the
              people of the State of Indiana, as represented by the Trustees of the State
              University, come in here and ask that the State Agricultural College may be located in
              connection with the State University.

            The gentleman says, however, that this cannot be done without abandoning the
              University  -that it cannot be done without
              abandoning the leading objects of the University. If I understand the University,it is
              an incorporation of schools in the various departments of learning; and where each
              department is separate and indepedant-to itself. And if this Agricultural College is
              located there with the Indiana University, it will be a separate and independent
              Institution. There would be separate departments for Law, Medicine and the natural
              Sciences-an Agricultural and a Military department, etc., and each one separate and
              independent from all the others. It is not necessary that all these departments should
              be united in one, in order to carry out the purposes of this grant in good faith.

            But the gentleman says: The State University is a sinking Institution, and has been
              continually calling upon the State for assistance, now, I say, Mr. Speaker, that that
              statement is erroneous. Till within a few years past the Indiana University never
              asked the State for a dollar. Till within a very few years this University has been
              abandoned to its late. Never until two years ago did the State of Indiana make an
              appropriation, or offer aid in any way in behalf of the State University. That
              institution has been struggling in poverty for many years; but since the State came to
              her assistance, no Institution in the State has been more prosperous.

            Mr. STANTON. I would like to know from the gentleman from Monroe, whether or not that
              Inititution has enjoyed the aid of the State to the extent of the proceeds of 45,000
              acres of land?

            Mr. BUSKIRK. No, sir; that was a National grant-the original endowment. I do not know
              exactly what was the original endowment. The funds arising from those land sales
              amounted to about one hundred thousand dollars. Subsequently Congress donated nineteen
              thousand acres ol land, and the State University still owns about 14,000 acres of
              that. The gentleman says that the State University is a sinking institution, requiring
              the support of the State. The State University has, for the past two years, had an
              appropriation of eight thousand dollars. That is all. Doubtless it would have been a
              very different Institution, if it had had a sufficient endowment to employ all the
              professors and teachers the Institution demands, But, I say, at the present time there
              is no Institution now in the west that is in a more nourishing condition. By the
              report of the Trustees there are about three hundred students now in
              attendance-attending the College proper. The preparatory department has been cut off;
              and heretofore there have been sixty and seventy to a hundred students connected with
              the preparatory department. And I make here the prediction that if this Agricultural
              fund be united with that institution, in five years time the Indiana University will
              contain more than have hundred students. The only trouble is there has not been a
              sufficient endowment. And what does the gentleman propose to do?-to establish two
              State schools, and both with insufficient endowments!

            Mr. Speaker, I find that I am getting very tedious in answering the gentleman's
              argument. [Cries of "go on."] I will soon be through.

            The gentleman has said something about our Railroad. Well, I presume it is not the
              best-and perhaps it is not the very worst railroad in the State. I find no difficulty
              about getting home that way from this city. I can leave Indianapolis at 9:20 in the
              morning, go to Bloomington and transact business, and get back at 6 o'clock in
              the evening. It has been made an objection to our locality, that the railroad
              facilities are not good-that there is but one road. But there are crossings of that
              road at Mitchell, thirty-five miles south, at Greencastle forty-five miles north, and
              at Gosport fifteen miles north. So that objection cannot be a very grave one.

            The gentleman makes another argument here-of course it was done wholly without note
              or preparation-which I shall call his I Ass-argument. It should cut, I think a very
              small figure in the location of this Institution at Bloomington or Greencastle. It
              seems from the gentleman's showing, that, in Putnam county they have been
              spending a good deal of time and money in mule and stock raising. Very well; that, I
              suppose, according to his taste, indicates a suitable locality for this College. But I
              would remark thereupon, that while they have been raising asses in Putnam county, we
              have been raising men in Monroe. [Laughter.] I could refer to many justly
              distinguished men who have been reared and educated in Monroe county; and I am proud I
              here to-night in the representation of the industrious, public spirited, reading,
              thinking and intelligent people of the grand old county of Monroe, which has furnished
              for the State such names as Whitcomb and Howard-the latter having lived and married
              there-besides three governors of the State, and others that I might mention-leaving
              myself out.

            Mr. OSBORN (in his seat.) And Harlan and Voorhees.

            Mr. BUSKIRK. I might name hundreds who have graduated at Bloomington as distinguished
              as these, but, not having prepared myself for this speech, 1 must omit them.

            The gentleman says Putnam county offers as a donation one hundred thousand dollars
              and forty acres of land for the location of the Agricultural College. Well, what of
              that? I say that is as nothing in comparison with the proposition that is made for the
              location in connection with the State University. But  the gentleman says the Trustees of the State University
              have neither power nor right to give it away-and it is to be supposed that the
              gentleman's assertion settles the law. But it seems that such Trustees in other
              States have done this thing. Let us for a moment compare the propositions made by
              Putnam County with those made by Monroe County and the Trustees of the State
              University. He says, Putnam County proposes one hundred thousand dollars and forty
              acres of very good soil. But the Trustees of the State University offer to turn over
              to the Agricultural College the University buildings and grounds at Bloomington, which
              with the land fund amount in value to to about four hundred thousand dollars: The
              value of the campus buildings, Laboratory, Library, etc. is one hundred and fifty
              thousand dollars; that of the University fund, about one hundred thousand dollars; and
              the fourteen thousand acres of land, about one hundred and fifty thousand. Then, in
              addition to that, the County of Monroe offers fifty thousand dollars.

            Mr. CORY (interposed to ask;) If the Agricultural College were established in
              connection with the State University, by whom would its affairs be administered and
              controlled?

            Mr. BUSKIRK. This bill says the Trustees of the State University and the Trustees of
              the Agricultural College shall have joint control; and there are five Trustees of the
              State University and five of the Agricultural College.

            Now, sir, I wish to refer to the offer made from Tippecanoe County. And I admit that
              it is liberal; but compared with the offer made from Bloomington,it is still
              insignificant,because it does not offer the requisite facilities. As I understand this
              proposition, Judge Purdue proposes to give one hundred and fifty thousand dollars,
              payable in ten years, without interest. And Tippecanoe county proposes fifty thousand
              dollars, payable in three years, also without interest-making two hundred thousand
              dollars. In addition to that, I understand that, if the College is located at the
              Battleground, there is a proposition to give some school buildings they have up there,
              which in my judgnemt, would be of very little use, because they are not adapted to
              wants of this institution. Now, what is the object of these donations? It is to enable
              the Trustees to procure the necessary materials and labor to erect the College
              buildings on the ground selected for its location. And would this small sum of fifteen
              thousand dollars a year suffice to erect the buildings in time to put the College in
              operation before the expiration of the time required in the grant? Certainly not. And
              let me make the prediction to-night, that, if you locate in Tippecanoe County upon the
              proposition of Mr. Purdue; you will find interested parties here applying for an
              appropriation of one hundred to two hundred thousand dollars to complete the
              buildings-just as we have already found it in the erection of th buildings of the
              Normal School, the Northern Prison, the House of Refuge and the Soldiers'
              Home.

            And where is the necessity for this? The State owns the buildings at Bloomington-they
              belong ow to the State-all that would be necessary to put the College in operation in
              thirty days. It will only be necessary to establish a chair of Agriculture. We have
              already a school of military science there. And the law says, the leading object shall
              be to teach those branches of science relating to Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts. I
              do not care whether you call it the leading object or not-there will be the
              Academical, the Agricultural, the Mechanical and the Military departments at once in
              operation.

            Mr. Speaker, I will only say this further it is in the experience of those older and
              larger Institutions in the countries of Europe, that Agricultural Colleges can't
              be sustained alone-that unconnected with other Institutions of learning, they will
              soon die out. The State of Illinois has made a mistake in locating her Agricultural
              College alone in Champaign County. It is languishing to-day, and has never had more
              than fifty students. The State of Michigan also has made a sad failure in this matter.
              Then where is the wisdom of these gentlemen corning here and asking you to follow
              these examples in another vain attempt to establish an independent Agricultural
              Institution? Time will prove that it will not succeed; and the inevitable demand will
              come sooner or later for a State endowment. And what farther will be the result of
              such an act? There will be two rival Institutions of Learning under the control of the
              State, and both depending upon her cherishing care. Would it not be better to unite
              them in one, and build up one grand Institution of which the State might be justly
              proud, than to have two, three or four Institutions on our hands-none of which would
              be, in any just sense, either efficient or respectable? It certainly would be much
              better, sir, to locate this College upon the Monroe proposition-better as to the
              consideration of dollars and cents-and better as to the economy of time and the
              expense of professorships. And the Institution will need no more assistance from the
              State. You will be able to establish at once all the departments of the Academy, law,
              medicine, military, science, agriculture and the mechanic arts. Tuition at the State
              University is free, and has been for a number of years: and if this College is located
              in connection with the State University, the young men of the State can come in and
              avail themselves of all the advantages of every
              school in the University, without paying a single dollar for tuition.

            I shall not refer to the propositions in detail as they come to us from Marion
              county, and as they have been modified since the last session of the General Assembly,
              for, I presume the gentlemen representing that County will be able and ready to do so
              with sufficient pertinency. I am satisfied, however, that their propositions are far
              in advance of those from Putnam County, or for any other locality, except
              Bloomington.

            I find, Mr. Speaker, that I have occupied much more time than I expected to consume
              when I got up to answer the gentleman from Putnam. I will not trespass any further
              upon the time of the House to-night.

            Mr. VATER then took the floor, and the House adjourned.

            Location of the Indiana Agricultural College ---- Mr, Dunn's

            AFTERNOON SESSION.
            [IN CONTINUATION-p.p. 125, 126.]

            The SPEAKER resumed at two o'clock and announced the consideration of Mr.
              Carnahan's resolution for the special order for to-night at seven and a half
              o'clock-the consideration of Mr. Dunn's Agricultural College bill [H. R.

            Mr. CHITTENDEN moved a substitute amendment for a Joint Convention of the two Houses
              to ballot for the location on Friday (to-morrow) at two o'clock p. m.

            On motion of Mr. ZOLLARS it was laid on the table-affirmative fifty, negative not
              counted.

            Mr. SLEETH moved ineffectually to make the order for two and a half o'clock this
              afternoon; and the question recurred on Mr. Carnahan's resolution.

            Mr. McFADIN spoke against a night session for determining this Agricultural College
              question.

            On motion of Mr. DITTEMOEE, Mr. Carnahan's resolution was laid on the
              table-affirmative 46, negative not counted.

            Mr. McFADIN moved to make the Agricultural bill the special order for to-morrow at
              two o'clock.

            Mr. DUNN proposed ineffectually, that the bill be made the special order for three
              o'clock.

            Mr. FULLER proposed to amend so as to proceed at once to ballot for a location, and
              that no other business shall be in order except privileged motions till the location
              shall be obtained.

            Mr. HAMILTON demanded the previous question, and amidst some confusion of voices in
              debate, and under its force, Mr. Fuller's amendment was adopted.

            The order, as amended by Mr. Fuller, was then adopted.

            Mr. WILDMAN moved, that each member be allowed twenty minutes to state the
              proposition for any location which he may represent.

            Mr. VATER objected to the motion, because it contravenes the order just adopted.

            Mr. HAMILTON considered that twenty minutes ought to be allowed to present the merits
              of each place competing for the location.

            Mr. STANTON, Mr. Speaker, I apprehend that any action taken here by the House for the
              utter suppression of debate will not be well received. I am in favor of the location
              of this College now. And I have a proposition from the Trustees of the Northwestern
              Christian University, that I would like to present: and my colleague, [Mr. Vater,] who
              has the floor on this bill, ought to have the right to speak. The proposition to which
              I refer was handed to me yesterday afternoon by Mr. Butler, President of the Board of
              Trustees of the Northwestern Christian University.

            Mr. WILDMAN. Mr. Speaker: Is my motion in order?

            The SPEAKER. The Chair thinks it is not; because the resolution adopted by the House
              prescribes that no other business shall be in order till the location shall be
              obtained.

            Mr. COFFROTH. Mr. Speaker: Before the vote was taken on the adoption of the
              resolution of the gentleman from Warrick, [Mr. Fuller,] the gentleman from Noble, [Mr.
              Taber,] asked whether any member would have 
              opportunity to present the proposition of his locality; and I made that proposition
              distinctly to the House; and that understanding was taken as I thought, by unanimous
              consent.

            Mr. DAVIS of Floyd. Mr. Speaker: The only point is, whether all the members from the
              County of Marion shall be heard on the Marion proposition. There is no objection to
              any gentleman occupying twenty minutes for one locality. But, after that, that
              locality is done. What is the use of undoing what we have done?

            Mr. VATER. Mr. Speaker: I insist upon mv objection to the motion.

            Mr. COFFROTH. I move to reconsider the vote adopting the order to proceed to the
              location.

            Mr. BOBO. I move to lay the motion to reconsider on the table.

            Mr. COFFROTH. Mr. Speaker: This resolution offered by the gentleman from Warrick,
              [Mr. Fuller,] operates as a rule of the House, and cannot be adopted till after twenty
              four hours notice. Therefore these proceedings are out of order.

            The SPEAKER. The Chair does not think the point of order well taken.

            Mr. STANTON. Mr. Speaker: I am willing to reconsider, and limit the speeches to
              fifteen minutes.

            The motion to lay the motion to reconsider on the table was rejected-yeas 37, nays
              50: and the question recurred on the adoption of the motion to reconsider.

            The motion to reconsider was agreed to: and the question recurred on Mr.
              Fuller's original resolution for location.

            Mr. COFFROTH. Mr. Speaker: I now move to amend the resolution so as to require the
              roll to be called, and to permit each member, when his name is called, to present the
              propositions and claims of his locality, and allow him a fifteen minutes speech.

            Mr. OSBORN. Mr. Speaker: It seems to me that we are getting along very slowly with
              this thing.

            The SPEAKER. We are operating under the force of the previous question. The motion of
              the gentleman from Huntington cannot be entertained.

            Mr. FULLER. Mr. Speaker: I am willing to accept the modification of the resolution as
              offered by the gentleman from Huntington, [Mr. Coffroth.]

            Mr. VATER. Mr. Speaker: I submit, that, if the House is acting under the previous
              question, the gentleman's amendment cannot be accepted.

            The SPEAKER. The point is well taken.

            Mr. COFFROTH. Then I move to reconsider the vote by which the House seconded-the
              previous question.

            The SPEAKER. That cannot be done, under the precedents of the last session.

            Mr. CORY. Mr. Speaker: I move to lay the resolution of the gentleman from Warrick on
              the table.

            The SPEAKER. That motion cannot be entertained now.

            Mr. CORY. Well; I suppose we can vote down the resolution.

            The SPEAKER. That is perhaps the only thing that can be done now for the
              gentleman.

            Mr. Fuller's resolution was then rejected-yeas 36, nays 52.

            Mr. FULLER. Mr. Speaker: I now submit the following:

            
              
                
                  RESOLVED, That the House do now proceed to locate the
                    Indiana Agricultural College; and that for that purpose, the Clerk shall call
                    the roll of members; and each member when his name is called, shall designate
                    the place of his choice; and no other business shall be in order till the
                    location is obtained: Provided, That each member shall have twenty minutes to
                    present his proposition.
                
              
            

            Mr. WILLIAMS of Knox. Mr. Speaker I submit the point of order. That this resolution
              of the gentleman from Warrick [Mr. Fuller] is new matter, and can not be entertained
              without leave of the House.

            Mr. WILDMAN. Mr. Speaker: I move to suspend the Rules for the consideration of that
              resolution.

            Mr. GORDON. Mr. Speaker: I submit the point, that the consideration of the resolution
              cannot be in order to-day because it is an amendment of the Rules.

            The SPEAKER. The chair cannot entertain the point.

            Mr. ZOLLARS. Mr. Speaker: I move to lay the motion to suspend the Rules on the
              table.

            Mr. DAVIS of Floyd. Mr. Speaker. The original proposition here was introduced
              yesterday by the gentleman from Posey [Mr. Carnahan.] Then the resolution of the
              gentleman from Warrrick [Mr. Fuller] was submitted this afternoon by way of amendment.
              Will the Speaker have the kindness to tell me how we got rid of the proposition of the
              gentleman from Posey?

            The SPEAKER. That was got rid of by being laid on the table.

            Mr. DAVIS. By being suppressed. But the proposition of the gentleman from Warrick was
              an amendment to an amendment.

            Mr. STANTON. The motion of the gentleman from Cass [Mr. McFadin] was the original
              proposition.

            The SPEAKER. The original proposition was submitted by the gentleman from Cass [Mr.
              McFadin.] Then the gentleman from Lawrence [Mr. Dunn] proposed to amend, by making the
              subject the special order for three  o'clock
              this afternoon. Then the gentleman Warrick [Mr. Fuller] submitted his resolution as an
              amendment by way of substitute, and it was adopted; and the question on the amendment
              as amended was then put to the House and adopted. Subsequently, the vote for the
              adoption of the resolution of the gentleman from Warrick was reconsidered, and it was
              voted down. So that matter was disposed of. The Chair entertains the motion of the
              gentleman from Allen [Mr. Zollars] to lay the motion of the gentleman from Howard [Mr.
              Wildman] to suspend the Rules for the consideration of the resolution of the gentleman
              from Warrick on the table.

            Mr. OSBORN. Mr. Speaker: I understand that we have a rule of the House., that bills
              and resolutions shall not be introduced except upon the call of the roll: and I
              submit, this changes the rule.

            The Speaker. The rule is, that when bills and resolutions are introduced, they shall
              be introduced upon the roll call. The Chair does not think that the point of the
              gentleman from Putnam [Mr. Osbron] is well taken. The motion is to suspend the order
              of busines. The question pending is to lay that motion on the table.

            The motion to lay on the table was rejected-yeas 33, nays 52-and the question
              recurred on the motion to suspend the order of business; which was agreed to.

            So, the order of business was suspended, and the question recurred again on the
              adoption of the resolution submitted by Mr. Fuller.

            Mr. DUNN Mr. Speaker: I offer the following as a substitute for the resolution
              submitted by the gentleman from Warrick:

            
              
                
                  RESOLVED, That any member from such counties as have
                    propositions before the General Assembly in reference to the location of the
                    Agricultural College be now allowed twenty minutes to discuss the question.
                
              
            

            
              
                

                  RESOLVED, That we then proceed to vote by ballot for the
                    location of the Agricultural College,the location having the lowest number of
                    votes to be rejected at the close of each ballot till the House shall agree upon
                    a location.
                
              
            

            Mr. COFFROTH. Upon that I demand the previous question.

            Mr. STANTON. I hope the gentleman will not do that. I desire to speak to the
              resolution.

            The SPEAKER. Debate is not in order.

            Mr. ZOLLARS. The rule which requires the roll to be called has not been suspended. I
              insist that the roll must now be called.

            The SPEAKER. The Chair thinks that the point is not well taken. The question is: will
              the House second the demand for the previous question?

            Mr. RUDDELL. I submit that the resolution of the gentleman from Warrick has not yet
              been presented to the House.

            The SPEAKER. It was taken as resented, with modification, by general consent although
              previously not reduced to form.

            Mr. STANTON. I call for the yeas and nays.

            The SPEAKER. The gentleman cannot demand the yeas and nays at this stage of the
              question.

            Mr. COFFROTH. Mr. Speaker: I will withdraw the demand for the previous question and
              move to amend the amendment the gentleman from Lawrence, [Mr. Dunn as to strike out
              that latter clause which requires the lowest number to be dropped: and upon that I
              demand again the previous question.

            The House then gave a second to the demand, and the main question was ordered.

            The SPEAKER. The first question is on the adoption of the amendment of the gentleman
              from Huntington.

            Mr. FULLER. The substitute requires us to vote by ballot-mine viva voce.

            The SPEAKER. Debate is not in order.

            The amendment (Mr. Coffroth's) to the amendment was adopted on a
              division-affirmative 51, negative not counted.

            The substitute amendment by Mr. Dunn, as amended by Mr. Coffroth, was then adopted
              without a division.

            Mr. STANTON. Mr. Speaker: I have a proposition from the President of the Board of
              Trustees of the Northwestern Christian University to this effect:

            That the Agricultural College "be located, established, and perpetrated upon
              their University Grounds and Campus," being twenty-five acres, and "be
              thereon perpetually maintained and sustained, by the use and application of all the
              funds and means accrued and to accrue to the State, for the use of such Agricultural
              College."

            Said College to be under exclusive control and management of the State, and its
              properly constituted authorities.

            University Grounds to be under Board of Directors, to consist of seven members three
              to be chosen by the General Assembly, three by said Corporation, and the seventh by
              these six conjointly.

            Said College to have perpetual use of said grounds.

            Within five years from acceptance, the State, with funds granted by county of Marion,
              and whatever sources, shall build on said grounds said Agricultural College, and
              "until the same be done, Provided the same be done within five years, the
              Agricultural College to have the use of the present College building."After the
              erection of an Agricultural College building, the other College to have exclusive  of present buildings, and such other buildings as
              the said Corporation May erece upon said grounds.

            The rights and privileges herein granted, are intended to be perpetual, and only to
              be forfeited by the State by removal of Agricultural College.

            Estimated money value of property of Corporation: College Grounds, seventy-five
              thousand dollars. College Building, seventy-five thousand dollars."To this may be
              added its endowment fund, to be held inviolate for that purpose-one hundred and ten
              thousand dollars.

            "The Corporations," says Mr. Butler, "offers to the State an equal
              interest in or undivided half of, its campus grounds and buildings."The sum of
              the value of these College facilities tendered for the use of the State is two hundred
              and sixty thousand dollars.

            The Commissioners of Marion County offer one hundred thousand dollars in County
              bonds, at six per cent interest, payable in ten and twenty years conditioned that the
              College be located within three miles of the City of Indianapolis.

            The sum of these endowments is three hundred and sixty thousand dollars, with
              conditions that admit of the same location. And with this also may be taken and
              included the proposition of Dr. Gustavus Scherman to donate twenty acres of land,
              southeast corner of 12th street and North Michigan road, or forty acres of land,
              northwest corner of Crawfordsville and County road, a quarter of a mile northwest of
              the City, valued at twenty thousand dollars; and the proposition of the Fletcher heirs
              to donate twenty-seven acres of land adjoining the grounds and campus of the
              Northwestern Christian University-the latter having an estimated value of sixty-one
              thousand dollars.

            Now, sir, a few words as to this general proposition. Other points are coming in here
              and competing for this location. If you locate in connection with the Northwestern
              Christian University, it will be a distinct Institution controlled by the State.
              Consider what we offer here: The University, two hundred and sixty thousand dollars;
              the County of Marion one hundred thousand dollars; The Fletcher heirs sixty-one
              thousand dollars; and Dr. Scherman twenty thousand dollars. The sum total is four
              hundred & forty one thousand dollars. And I understand that the Commissioners of
              Marion County will "propose, or have already proposed, seventy-five thousand
              dollars more.

            The proposition from Monroe County is more properly the assumption of a proposition
              by that interest for the State of Indiana to turn over the Indiana University to the
              Agricultural College. It certainly is not for the gentleman from Monroe, [Mr.
              Buskirk,] or any other gentleman, to say, that the Agricultural College shall be
              located down there at Bloomington upon such an assumption. But if the State of Indiana
              sees proper, she can take what she has there for a University and transfer or remove
              it to the City of Indianapolis. The proposition of Monroe County as a county is to
              give fifty thousand dollars for the location there of the Agricultural College. That
              is all. They offer no comparison with the donations from Tippecanoe County. Tippecanoe
              has made a very generous offer.

            There has been a proposition to divide this National endowment fund between the State
              University, the Normal School, and other schools of learning in the State. But this
              idea is not in the Marion County proposition. It was proposed at the last session by
              the Senator from Monroe [Judge Hughes.] No proposition to divide and scatter this fund
              should meet with any favor. It is hostile to what should be the great object in the
              establishment of this Institution; That object being to establish a great central
              Institution of which the State might be justly proud, with all the departments and
              schools of science, philosophy, law, medicine, etc., which pertain to the University.
              And what location is there in the State that presents the facilities of access for the
              people which we have here at Indianapolis? There is none that can so combine all the
              facilities and advantages for making this Institution a credit to the State as
              Indianapolis-and gentlemen know it full well. The gentleman from Monroe told us, at
              the regular session that the State of Pennsylvania made a great mistake in locating
              her Agricultural College with another school, and the consequence was, they both died
              together. Then let the State of Indiana be admonished not to do the same thing by
              uniting this College with the State University at Bloomington. I do not doubt that
              Monroe is a good county, and that there are eminent men who have been educated and are
              still living at Bloomington. But it is not the place for such an Institution. Where do
              you find old Harvard? It is near the old City of Boston-the Hub. Where do you find
              Yale, and Brown University? They are at great central points where men do naturally
              congregate.

            Now, sir, it is for the House to say to-day, whether they will locate this
              Institution in some out of the way place, or in the great centre of all the
              industrial, mechanical and commercial interests of the State. It does seem to me, that
              we should look at this fact as of the greatest value in the question of locating this
              College. And the same objection that attaches to the Bloomington location, attaches
              also to all the others named outside of Indianapolis, but perhaps not so strongly to
              some of them.  I insist that it is our duty, sir,
              to place this Institution where all concerned may have all the readiest and best
              advantages of access and training, and in making the location to have more regard to
              these than to the donations that are offered by competitors for out of the way and
              incovenient localities. This Institution is not to be regarded as an ephemeral thing,
              for the use of a day, or of a single generation, but as an Institution of great public
              and perpetually growing utility, demanding at our hands, a location where it will
              enjoy the best facilities for the advancement of the leading interests of the country
              for which it was designed.

            Mr. Speaker: I make this plea for what I believe to be for the benefit of the State
              at large, and not, as the gentleman says, because we want every thing here at
              Indianapolis. It is for the interest of the State that we should have this College
              here, just as it is for the interest of business men to come here and invest hundreds
              of thousands of dollars in manufactures and trade. And have not members here from
              Marion county voted for all the appropriations for the Normal School at Terre Haute?
              and does the gentleman forget what we have done and are still doing every year for
              Blooming-ton? And what we have accorded by our votes here in these,directions, is the
              best pledge of what at the proper time we will be ready to do for the Northern and
              Eastern portions of the State.

            It is not right to crowd into the same quarter all the great public institutions of
              the State, and I do not believe it will be done. Nor can I believe that gentlemen will
              permit themselves to be drawn away from a just and most advantageous location of this
              College by any feeling of prejudice. It was upon this principle, that I advocated the
              proposition for a Reformatory for girls and women, before I knew there was a provision
              in the bill locating it at Indianapolis.

            Mr. BUSKIRK. (Mr. Gordon in the Chair.) Mr. Speaker: I was out of the Hall when the
              gentleman read the propositions from Marion County. I would like to ask him, if the
              proposition on behalf of the Northwestern Christian University is made by the Trustees
              of that Institution?

            Mr. STANTON. I understand that it is. They had a meeting on Friday.

            Mr. BUSKIRK. Is the proposition of the Fletcher heirs any thing more than simply a
              proposition to give the land?

            Mr. STANTON. It is nothing more.

            Mr. BUSKIRK. Are all these propositions binding, if the location of the College is
              made at Indianapolis?

            Mr. STANTON. Of course. No man who is acquainted with these parties could ask
              anything more. You can have the deeds and papers to-night, if you make the location
              here, if they are not presented here tomorrow then you can make the location down at
              Bloomington or some other point.

            Mr. BRECKINRIDGE. Mr. Speaker: Having on a former occasion presented my views at
              length on the claims of my Count for the location of this College, I shall only occupy
              the attention of the House for a few minutes, in again urging those claims, have been
              largely increased since the session.

            In addition to the offer made by the Battle Ground and the County Commissioners the
              Hon. John Purdue of Lafayette, offers the further munificent sum of one hundred and
              fifty thousand dollars on condition that it is located in Tippecanoe County, and that
              it bear his name.

            If located there, your College is an assured success. Mr. Purdue is an eminently
              practical man, of large means and whatever he undertakes in the way of business, he
              carries to a successful completion. Besides all this he takes a deep interest in the
              cause of Education. He has neither wife or child. He has provided liberally for his
              family relations, and in some sense this University, bearing his name may be regarded
              as his only child; and there need be no doubt in the mind of any one that it will be
              liberally provided for.

            Mr. Speaker, I do not wish to draw an invidious comparison between the offers made by
              my County, and those of other places seeking this location. I prefer to leave that to
              others, and rest the question upon its merits with the judgment of the House.

            In regard to Bloomington and the State University I entertain the kindest feelings.
              The Indiana University has a Faculty of which any Institution might be proud. She has
              graduated a great many young men, who are not only an honor to our own State, but to
              the whole country. In conclusion, I submit it to the judgmrnt of honorable gentlemen,
              whether we can afford to loose this large sum of money offered by the people I
              represent to the cause of Education in our young and growing State?

            But a word more. It might be proper for me to state, that it is the suggestion and
              design of Mr. Purdue, that no part, either of the National donation or his donation of
              one hundred and fifty thousand dollars shall be put into brick and morter, but that
              all shall remain as an endowment for the College. And I am authorized by Mr. Purdue to
              say, that, if no other party will do better, he stands ready to give one hundred acres
              of land for a site for the buildings, &c., of the Institution, near the city of
              Lafayette. Mr. Purdue does not favor the Battle Ground location.

            Mr. BUSKIRK. (Mr. Gordon in the  Chair.) Is it
              not true that the property of the Battleground would not be available for the
              College?

            Mr. BRECKINRIDGE. It would not.

            Mr. BUSKIRK. How do you expect to get the buildings?

            Mr. BRECKINRIDGE. Mr. Purdue has a wide acquaintance in the country, and especially
              in the city of New York; and he says he has assurances of the aid of solid men in this
              enterprise in which he takes so much interest. But there are propositions at various
              points in Tippecanoe County besides the Battleground. I will just refer to one. Here
              it is in writing, from a man whose word is as as his bond, and who is able to do what
              he says he will do:

            
              
                
                  
                  "I propose to donate my farm for the Agricultural College, if the same is
                    located upon it. It contains three hundred and twenty acres, including Shawnee
                    Mound and forty acres of timber land. The land of the Prarie has an elevation of
                    about 75 feet; and it has an inexhaustable supply of sand and gravel, and of
                    springs of water; and an abundant supply of clay for making brick. It is not
                    surpassed in the county or State in its desirableness as to health, fertility or
                    location. It is worth thirty thousand dollars. My neighbors stand ready to
                    pledge themselves for fifty thousand dollars toward the buildings.
                  
                    "Signed by
                    J. MEHARY.
                  
                
                
              
            

            Mr. BUSKIRK. How far is that from Lafayette?

            Mr. BRECKINRIDGE. Twelve miles from Lafayette, with two connecting gravel Of course,
              it will be for the Trustees of the College to name the place for it. But if nobody
              else should give an acceptable location, Mr. Purdue will give one hundred acres; and
              these one hundred acres will be worth one hundred and twenty thousand dollars. Land
              has been sold in that quarter for one hundred and ten to one hundred and twelve
              dollars an acre.

            Mr. BUSKIRK. Is not Mr. Purdue's proposition made upon the express condition,
              that the College shall be named after him?

            Mr. BRECKINRIDGE. I know nothing about that but what is contained in the proportion
              itself. It seems to me that such a condition would be nothing but right, in view of Ms
              donations of one hundred and fifty thousand dollars in money, and one hundred and
              twenty thousand dollars in land: and this besides the consideration that Mr. Purdue
              has neither wife nor child, and that this College becomes his darling pet. He is worth
              at least half a million of dollars. And Mr. Purdue, if he gets the College, means to
              make it a success.

            I would say further, in regard to the objection pf the gentlemen from Monroe, [Mr.
              Buskirk,] that Mr. Purdue's payment of fifteen thousand dollars a year would be
              too small a fund. I am informed that Mr. Purdue has told a gentleman here, that he
              would pay the money as fast as it might be wanted.

            Now, Mr. Speaker, I think I have presented all that is necessary in regard to this
              proposition from the County of Tippecanoe. I have nothing to say against any other
              locality. I concede freely, that the Indiana University at Bloomington is an honor to
              the State. I know that she has graduated many worthy and honorable men. We make our
              proposition along with others, and leave it upon its merits to the decision of the
              General Assembly. It would seem to me, however not to be the part of wisdom to refuse
              this large amount of money and means proposed in this way to be given to the cause of
              Education.

            Mr. McFADIN. Mr. Speaker: There are nine minutes left of the time of the gentleman
              from Tippecanoe, [Mr. Breckinridge,] and I ask leave of the House to occupy that nine
              minutes-the remainder of his twenty minutes.

            Mr. BUSKIRK. If the same advantage is extended to Monroe County I shall not
              object.

            The SPEAKER. (Mr. Gordon in the Chair.) If the gentleman from Cass [Mr. McFadin] has
              a proposition to make, he has a right to the floor to submit it.

            Mr. BUSKIRK. If he have a proposition from his own county.

            Mr. McFADIN. I have a proposition of one hundred thousand dollars, by Dr. Rollins and
              others.

            Mr. BUSKIRK. Mr. Speaker: I appeal to the House, whether this proposition is to be
              received in good faith, or whether it is not merely an evasion of the rule?

            Mr. McFADIN. Then I will make it on my own behalf. [Laughter.]

            Mr. BUSKIRK. Mr. Speaker: I call for the reading of the resolution authorizing this
              debate; and I submit this question to the House: Whether any gentleman can speak now,
              except those representing counties having propositions here for this location?

            Mr. GORDON. Mr. Speaker: As I recollect, the resolution does not state, that the
              proposition shall come from the gentleman's own-county. It does not state that
              the location shall be in his own county: but that he shall have twenty minutes to
              present the claims of the locality of his choice. Any member has the right to present
              his locality.

            The SPEAKER. The ruling of the gentleman from Boone was no doubt honestly made. But
              it recurs to me that under his construction, every gentleman on the floor would have
              the right to speak twenty minutes; and I am going to take the sense of the House upon
              the ruling of the gentleman from Boone? [Mr. Gordon,] under which the gentleman from
              Cass, [Mr. McFadin] is claiming the right to speak. 

            

            Mr. CORY. I understand that the presiding officer of the House gave the gentleman
              from Cass the right to speak.

            The SPEAKER. There remains always with the Chair the right to revise the ruling. I do
              not propose to revise the ruling of the gentleman from Boone, but to submit the
              question of its correctness to the House.

            Mr. STEWART of Rush. If the ruling of the gentleman of Boone is not sustained, we
              shall rule out at least one locality from a hearing on the floor-I refer to the County
              of; Hancock, for which, I understand the gentleman from Franklin, [Mr. Cory,] has been
              invited to speak.

            The SPEAKER reads Mr. Dunn's resolution as adopted for the direction of the
              House under this order.

            Mr. MITCHELL. Unless the proposition be submitted to the House at the time the:
              gentleman takes the floor, or before that time, he has not the right to speak.

            The SPEAKER. That is the ruling of the Chair: and the question is: Shall that stand
              as the judgment of the House? Shall the gentleman from Cass have the right to proceed?
              The vote on this question was taken on a division of the House, and
              reported-affirmative 33, negative 36; so the ruling of the gentleman from Boone was
              revised, and the subsequent ruling of the Speaker was sustained.

            Mr. McFADIN. I call for a recount.

            Mr. DAVIS of Floyd. Mr. Speaker: I am perfectly willing to hear the gentleman from
              Cass. But the plain English of the resolution for this order is, that we shall pursue
              a particular course. I will vote for the gentleman from Cass to speak; but I cannot
              vote to give; the resolution the construction which is demanded, because the plain
              English of it is the other way.

            Mr. McFADIN. I object to the manner in which it was read.

            The SPEAKER. The gentleman from! Cass will take his seat.

            Mr. DAVIS of Floyd. Mr. Speaker: I understand that we may vote to give a construction
              to the resolution that will not allow the floor to the gentleman from Cass; and that
              afterwards we may give him the right to speak.

            Mr. COFFROTH. Mr. Speaker: The question as presented by the Chair to the House was
              not exactly in the parliamentary order, Upon the question as presented by the Chair:
              Is the gentleman from Cass under the resolution entitled to speak? I have to vote No.
              But if the question were simply: May he speak? I should vote Aye.

            The SPEAKER. If the construction of the gentleman from Boone had been sustained and
              carried out, it would have permitted every gentleman on the floor to occupy twenty
              minutes. But, as gentlemen are aware I as a party somewhat interest in this and
              therefore I referred the question House.

            Mr. McFADIN. Mr. Speaker: I will withdraw my proposition. Does the Chair hold, that
              where a gentleman who is entitled to speak does not occupy his twenty minutes, I can
              occupy the remainder of his time?

            The SPEAKER. The gentleman cannot unless it is by the consent of the House.

            Mr. GORDON. Mr. Speaker: I did not rule, that the gentleman from Cass could occupy
              the unexpired time of the gentleman from Tippecanoe. My ruling was, that he had the
              right to present an independent pro. position, though it might not be for any locality
              in his own county.

            On motion of Mr. DITTEMORE, it was ordered by consent, that the gentleman from Cass
              be allowed to speak twenty minutes.

            Mr. McFADIN. Mr. Speaker: I will be magnanimous. The House has given me twenty
              minutes; I will occupy but ten. Sometimes I may be wrong. But I never give it up until
              I find that out; and then my own conscience obliges me.

            Mr. Speaker: I will present the claims of the Northern part of the State. I am not
              going to run any other locality. I consider that the County of Monroe has claims-good
              claims; and so have the counties of Marion, Hancock and Putnam-all these have their
              claims upon our attention. But we also have our claims. In the northern part of the
              State of Indiana not one of these great public institutions have ever yet been
              located. And, sir, we have the very garden spot of the world. We have men of energy
              and worth, good climate, good soil, and we abound in building materials of all kinds I
              am not speaking especially in behalf of Logansport, but I am speaking in behalf of the
              flourishing city of Lafayette-forty-five miles west of us. You have all heard of it,
              sir, as a city located on the Wabash river. With reference to the county of Marion and
              the city of Indianapolis, I think they have had their full share. I consider also,
              that the State has done about all she well could do in behalf of the counties of
              Monroe and Vigo. And now, in the northern part of the State we ask for the location of
              this Agricultural College. This is no mere selfish demand. We have the facilities and
              advantages that invite the location. We have railroads running all through the
              northern part of the State. It is true we have a State prison there, but this we do
              not consider an improvement. It is rather a burden upon us; and we would rather it
              were in some other part of the State, where prisons are needed, and where it might
              require less pay to take the prisoners.In reference to the proposition of Judge  Purdue - he is a very wealthy, and a very able
              man, and has nothing to live for but himself, and to following the promptings of his
              public spirited, noble and humane impulses; and how naturally and grandly would they
              fall in with an expression from the General Assembly in favor of locating this College
              at the Tippecanoe Battleground. Sir, this locality is historical. This is the ground
              where General Harrison, in 1811, so heroically put an end to the war - the long and
              weary strife of blood - with the Indians of the Northwest. And I am informed, that
              within a very short distance from the Battleground, there is one of the finest springs
              of living water in the State of Indiana. [Laughter.] Yes sir! I thank the House, Mr.
              Speaker, for their attention: and while I am taking up your valuable time, I am
              pleased to see faces of cheerfulness and good humor. If we can't get
              Indianapolis, we can go on farther, and set this College down on the memorable field
              of Tippecanoe. [Cheers.] I speak for Tippecanoe. [Continued cheerings.] And I am glad
              to be relieved from saying much more, because I feel that the claims of Tippecanoe
              have been well represented by the gentleman [Mr. Breckinridge] who last occupied the
              floor in that behalf. Living near there myself, I would like to have an Institution of
              this kind, so that I might conveniently visit it, when my grand children might go to
              College there. [Laughter.] I stand up here for the location of this College in our
              part of the State, because nearly every other quarter of the State has been
              distinguished by the location of some public institution. Gentlemen talk about the
              river advantages of the centre and south: Sir, we have Lake Michigan in the North. And
              when we come up here, modestly, and ask for the location of the Agricultural College,
              it cannot be that the House is unwilling to give us a few moments to present our
              claims. [Applause.] And now sir, having spoken out my ten minutes, I return thanks for
              the opportunity which the House has accorded to me to present the claims for the
              location of this College which are felt in the northern portion of the State of
              Indiana. [Prolonged applause.]

            Mr. CORY. Mr. Speaker: I am not here representing Hancock County; but I have been
              requested to present the claims of Hancock County for the location of this
              Agricultural College, and I will proceed to do so. The county of Hancock, by her
              commissioners, propose to give for the location of the Indiana Agricultural College
              one hundred and twenty-thousand dollars. This proposition is in writing. And
              additional to this, it is proposed to give one hundred acres of good land, adjoining
              the town of Greenfield, the county-seat of Hancock County;-lying twenty miles east of
              Indianapolis. That is a good location. It is central. There is hardly a member upon
              this floor, but desires to locate this college centrally. Other things being equal,
              they are generally in favor of a central location. Marion County is regarded as the
              center of the State; and, if we would locate it precisely in the center, we would
              select Marion County. But there is a difference between the proposition from Marion
              County and that from Hancock; and that is here: Marion County offers one hundred
              thousand dollars in bonds, running ten and twenty-years ; and we might be obliged to
              expend one hundred thousand dollars on this college before we would realize their
              bonus. But the offer from Hancock County may be received at once: so that their one
              hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars and one hundred acres of land placed at once
              in the hands of the College Board, they may go right to work on the buildings.

            During the regular session, some gentlemen insinuated here, that the land in Hancock
              County is not as good as it might be. I am willing to acknowledge, sir, that they have
              in Hancock County some land that are thin. This is the case in all the counties of the
              State. But they do not offer the thin lands to the College. They offer as good lands
              as can be found in the State of Indiana. They offer rich bottom land, most desirably
              located. This offer is perhaps as good as any other that has been made upon this
              floor. It takes but one hour to reach it, and one hour to run back, from this city.
              One of our most flourishing railroads passes immediately by the town of Greenfield,
              and through and over the land proposed to be donated for this College. So you might
              regard this as a central location. Near enough to the center, and near enough to the
              city. A college ought not to be located in a great city. I submit that it is not
              desirable to put this college very near, or within the corporate limits of a large
              city. But I do not care to argue that point.

            Now, Mr. Speaker, I should not have said this much, if it had not been for certain
              things that have occurred on this floor to-day. My idea is that we should be allowed
              to present the claims of each locality;-that we should have ample time; and that every
              member should be treated exactly alike. But when I saw a disposition to suppress other
              claims, after certain points have occupied the House for an hour or an hour and a
              halt; I felt that I would like to put in a word. And you have actually allowed to
              Hancock twenty minutes, after giving to Putnam an hour and twenty minutes, and
              Bloomington an hour and twenty minutes! Now, sir, why have you done this? I put it to
              gentlemen who wish to act fairly in this matter-why?

            A VOICE. Go ahead, and make your proposition. 

            

            Mr. CORY. The gentleman tells me to go ahead, and make my proposition, if I have got
              one. But I will not be personal. Fairness is what I want, and all I want here.-I want
              to say here: that if my first choice can't receive the location, then I will take
              what I conceive to be the second best choice, and I will vote for that. And I will say
              this word more: that we have a magnificent fund here, out of which we propose to build
              a college in the interests of agriculture and of mechanic arts; and the true Indianian
              will never endorse our act, if at any time we propose to make this college an adjunct
              of any other institution. If we propose to tack this College upon some other, and make
              it the mere tail of some other Institution, the people of Indiana will never endorse
              our act. It should never be given to any other Institution. It should not be hidden
              away at Bloomington or anywhere else, where it will lose its identity with the
              interests of the mechanical, the agricultural and industrial classes of the State. It
              is to be a College in the interest of agriculture and the mechanic arts. So the people
              understand its purpose and design, and they will never excuse the act that would take
              i t from them. It is not enough to say here, that this Institution can't succeed
              alone as an Agricultural College. The people won't believe it. This fund will
              endow an Institution that may run fifteen professorships. Would not that be enough?
              Other Institutions may fail for want of money. But this cannot fail on that account;
              because only the income can be used for current expenses. We have here an endowment of
              two hundred and forty thousand dollars. I may not be exactly correct; but we may use
              in the neighborhood of twenty-five thousand dollars yearly; the proceeds of the
              interest on the endowment, which I understand is invested in United States Bonds. The
              fund is ample. It does not depend upon money to be drawn from the working classes. You
              may have students, or you may not have students. Wherever you have got an Institution
              in such a comfortable fix, it is a success; it can't help but be a success.

            The only idea that I wish still further to impress upon the minds of members is this:
              We should use this fund as Congress intended we should use it: in the interest of the
              industrial classes-in the interest of the laboring men of the State. We should make it
              a distinct Institution of its kind; and not make it a department or a chair in some
              other Institution.

            Mr. NEFF. Mr. Speaker: Before I proceed with what I have to say, I will ask for the
              reading of the proposition from my County, sent here to my colleague [Mr. Osborn.

            The proposition was read by the Clerk to this effect:

            [Date.] State of Indiana, Putnam County.

            We the undersigned Commissioners of Putnam County agree to pay to the Trustees of the
              Indiana Agricultural College one hundred thousand dollars provided said College be
              located in Putnam County - county bonds-payable in ten years.

            [Signed]

            Mr. NEFF. There is also a proposition tendering forty acres of land upon the same
              condition as to location. It was tendered at the regular session.

            Mr. Speaker: I shall not perhaps occupy the time of the House to the extent of the
              twenty minutes which has been allotted to members for the different localities in
              presenting the claims which I conceive they have in my county for the location of this
              Institution. My Colleague having presented our claims last night, perhaps I may be now
              regarded as an intruder. However this may be, it is at any rate with diffidence that I
              can speak here when I think the House would prefer action to hearing some man talk. I
              claim, sir, to be a very modest man,-which I could establish bepond any reasonable
              doubt, if I had time. [Laughter.]

            I do not know, sir, that I should have said anything at this time, but for one remark
              of the honorable speaker [Mr. Buskirk] last evening when this matter was being
              discussed. That gentleman said, with a good deal of emphasis, that Putman County was
              not in the ring-that Putman County had not been heard from. Well, she wants to be
              heard; and, as we talk the matter over, that fact may be seen. Sir, I have found, in
              this debate, a verification of the old adage: "Every crow thinks her own the
              blackest." Every gentleman competing here thinks he has superior claims for this
              location. Well, I am satisfied that many of us very much desire this location: and I
              can say, that those making this proposition which has been just read here, would like
              very much to have this College located with them. But I have another proposition.

            We are here but for a very brief space of time. But what we do-perhaps it would be
              well for us to consider-will be done for all time. Hence, as men who desire to do what
              is right between man and man, it is our duty, not only to represent our immediate
              constituents, but also to represent and act for the general interest and welfare of
              the State at large. We should not view this matter altogether in the light of the
              advantages it might bring to the locality that presents the greatest amount of money.
              We should not disregard all other questions, and decide as to the location simply on
              that ground. The question of eligibility should enter into this matter.

            I should not now, perhaps, have much to say in regard to the claims of Putnam County,
              - having spoken on this subject once at the last session, and my colleague [Mr.
              Osborn] having  devoted his time to it but last
              evening. All I have to say is: we offer a good location-a healthy location, and that
              one of the great national thoroughfares passes through it; and that it is hut an hour
              and five minutes ride from this capitol. I am not one who believes that this
              Institution ought to be located in a crowded city. I conceive that it is attached to
              agriculture as its primary object. That being the grand leading object, we should
              locate it in an agricultural region. As intimated by the gentleman fcom Franklin [Mr.
              Cory,] there will be a superficial fund accruing from the endowment, after the
              buildings shall have been erected, to institute and maintain teachers in all the
              various branches of science contemplated in the act of Congress. Then, I ask you, sir,
              why make it a side-show to any other Institution of learning?

            I shall endeavor to avoid the drawing of any invidious distinctions and comparisons,
              as against other localities and other Institutions. As far as Monroe Connty is
              concerned, I have many friends there. They have there a noble and enterprising people.
              I know they have struggled there against many obstacles and much opposition. And it
              has long been with them a matter of ingenious local pride to maintain and keep up the
              State University. And they have actually done more than ought to have been expected of
              them. They have done much, and succeeded well. They have become almost historical
              through their great men. But this Agricultural College is not designed so much to make
              statesmen-not so much to teach the classics, as to teach farming. I hold, that the
              time has arrived, and now is, that the people of this country should turn their
              attention to agriculture-especially in the great West. I hold that the time has fully
              come when we should elevate the student of agriculture-when we should foster and
              sustain it, and no longer leave it, and treat it as a sideshow to the professions and
              the halls of learning, in the various sectional and sectarian schools of the State.
              Those Institutions are doing their own peculiar work, and should not expect the help
              of the State: I ask it not for Putnam County-for the Asbury University there. Asbury
              has struggled on, and on, till she has overtopped and mastered the waves. She needs no
              help. She asks it not. She is now rearing a new superstructure of which the county
              will be proud.

            But, as I was saying, if I have warm friends, they are at Bloomington. It is the only
              place of which it can be said of me: He recited a lesson at College. And that was but
              for a brief space of time. But what does that locality base its claims upon? They say
              they will give fifty thousand dollars. That is clever, put why send our young men away
              down there into Monroe? It is a beautiful place to look at; but a most excellent place
              to move from. [Laughter.] Why not make it more central? I am not making a speech any
              more for Green-castle, than for any other central locality. Why go down to Monroe
              County ? Why not go out where there are larger farming interests ? where the young men
              in attendance in this College can apply themselves to the practice of their calling ?
              where they may find a desirable emulation in the example of the larger farmers in the
              center and more northern part of the State ? I think, sir, that we can find a more
              eligible location than Bloomington. And I will say at the same time, that, after
              looking over all this ground, Putnam County is, in my judgment, about as good a
              location as we can find.-I do not desire to weary the House.-We offer, as I have said,
              a healthy, and every way, a desirable and eligible location. But why pass by
              Indianapolis ? It is a crowded city. But there, in Putnam, every one is a farmer. I
              have nothing to say in regard to Lafayette, but this : I think it is a little too far
              north.-And I think, that Putnam County is the very place of all others for this
              College,and that gentlemen would sleep sounder to-night for locating it there.

            Mr. BUSKIRK. (Mr. Johnston of Parke in the Chair.) Mr. Speaker: I do not propose to
              occupy but a moment's time in what I have to say-occupied as I have been all day.
              I wish to refer briefly to the propositions from the different competing localities.In
              the first place, I will refer to the Tippecanoe proposition; and I think I shall be
              able to satisfy you that it is not such a proposition as the House ought to
              accept.

            The donation proposed by Mr. Purdue is one hundred and fifty thousand dollars,
              payable in ten years, without interest-not to be used for the erection of buildings,
              but as a constant endowment. The County of Tippecanoe proposes fifty thousand dollars.
              Then, in case the College is located at the Battleground, there are some school
              buildings offered there, valued at twenty thousand dollars; then there is the Mehary
              farm, offered only upon the condition that the College is located on the Shawnee
              Mound. Consequently, we have but this reliacle proposition before the House from
              Tippecanoe : that on the behalf of the County Commissioners, and that on behalf of Mr.
              Purdue-the Commissioners fifty thousand dollars, without interest, and Mr.
              Purdue's one hundred and fifty thousand dollars, and of that no part is to be
              used for the purpose of erecting buildings.

            Mr. BRECKINRIDGE (interrupting.) I said it was not the design that any part of it
              should be so used, because money for that purpose was expected from other sources.

            Mr. BUSKIRK. If it is not designed by Mr. Purdue, it will not be done. And the  hope, that he will get some wealthy men in New
              York to give money to erect the College buildings, ought not to give a sufficient
              assurance to the House to make the location there. But if the House does not heed this
              hint, what will be the result of that location of the College?

            Something has been said in reference to Colleges in the cities. If we locate this
              College in Tippecanoe County, it will be placed in the vicinity of a city of some
              fifteen or twenty thousand inhabitants; so that the objection of a city locality will
              apply directly there. And the only reliable propositions from that quarter are the
              fifty thousand dollars from the Commissioners and the one hundred and fifty thousand
              dollars from Mr. Purdue, of which no part is to be used for the purpose of erecting
              buildings. Where then will the buildings come from before the Congressional grant
              expires? The money to erect them will come out of the pockets of the people of the
              State. And when you and I shall come back here, two years hence, (if the
              Constitutional Amendment should not defeat me,) we shall have to make an appropriation
              for the buildings. The payments of the one hundred and fifty thousand dollars will
              come in in such small dribs, that it will not avail for the buildings.

            Mr. BRECKINRIDGE (interposing, and Mr. Buskirk giving way.) I said that I would make
              a statement of Mr. Purdue's mind, or of his opinion. I am not authorized to say
              that none of this money will be used for the erection of buildings.' I said it
              would not be used in purchasing grounds.

            Mr. BUSKIRK (resuming.) The House can see the uncertainty of the proposition. Then
              further; the proposition is not in shape, unless Mr. Purdue sees proper to carry it
              out in good faith. If he sees proper and if he entertains the views expressed by the
              gentleman from Tippecanoe, [Mr. Breckinridge,] he can refuse to erect the
              buildings.

            There is another objectionable feature in connection with this proposition coming
              from Tippecanoe County and that is this: That this magnificent fund, that has been
              given by the Congress of the United States for the purpose of puting into operation
              our great State Agricultural College must be used so as to perpetuate the name of John
              Purdue-that it shall be called the Purdue College. If he desires to perpetuate his
              name in connection with some institution of learning, let him endow it wholly himself,
              and not look to the United States. In twenty-five years it will never be thought of
              that the United States made this munificient contribution of land for this school.

            Mr. PIERCE of Porter, (interposing.) Was not the same thing done in New York?

            Mr. BUSKIRK. It was under different circumstances. Mr. Cornell gave a million and a
              half of dollars.

            Mr. PIERCE of Porter. The gentleman is mistaken. The Cornell donation was five
              hundred thousand dollars.

            Mr. BUSKIRK. I may be mistaken as to the amount. I have nothing to say in reference
              to the location of this College in the northern part of the State. But my proposition
              is to place it with the Indiana University. The gentleman from Franklin, [Mr. Cory]
              says that would be to make it the tail of another Institution. We do not propose that.
              We propose to make it the head rather The Agricultural department will be of equal
              importance with all the other schools. But that matter, of course, will be carried out
              according to law. We are already establishing in the Indiana University, a department
              of military science; and it only remains for this fund to establish a department of
              Agriculture and the mechanic arts. I say, Mr. Speaker that, in a University proper,
              one department or school is of just as much consequence as another. They are all
              alike. Consequently the school of Agriculture and the mechanic arts could not be made
              subservient to the interests of the State University.

            Mr. DAVIS of Floyd, (interposing.) Suppose I desire to educate my son as a farmer, he
              could be educated at Bloomington, as the law now is, except that he could not be
              taught farming there, by experience. Then, if we locate this College at another place,
              and I desire to have him educated thoroughly as a farmer, I would have to send him to
              another College.

            Mr. BUSKIRK. That would be my inference.-I wish now to refer to the offer of Putnam
              County. The gentleman [Mr. Neff] complained that I said last night that Putnam County
              is not in the ring. But the gentleman will remember that I said that-if I used that
              expression-it was because the gentleman from Putnam and Hendricks [Mr. Osborn] did not
              insert Putnam County in lieu of "Monroe and Blooomington," which he proposed
              to strike out of the bill.

            Mr. OSBORN (interposing.) Putnam county has been in the ring all the time; and her
              paper ought to have been before the House all the time.

            Mr. BUSKIRK. I do not say that is not so. But let us see what they offer. It is to
              give one hundred thousand dollars in ten years, or to pay it sooner if the County see
              proper; and to give forty acres of land. What would that amount to? One hundred
              thousand dollars in ten years would not enable the Board of Trustees to erect the
              buildings. And how would the buildings be provided for, unless we were to locate the
              college in connection with the Asbury University?

            Mr. OSBORN (interposing.) I hope the gentleman does not intend to misrepresent this
                 paper. Putnam County proposes county bonds for
              one hundred thousand dollars, payable in years and drawing ten per cent interest-to
              become the property of the College.

            Mr. BUSKIRK. As I read the proposition they offer one hundred thousand dollars in ten
              years - not due till the end of ten years.

            Mr. NEFF (interposing.) Are not the Monroe County bonds to be made payable in ten
              years?

            Mr. BUSKIRK. No sir.-payable in five rears with interest from date.

            The SPEAKER pro tem. (Mr. Johnston of Parke
              in the Chair.) Due in ten years, the county reserving the right to pay them sooner if
              they so elect. They are payable ten years after they become due.

            Mr. OSBORN. The Putnam County one hundred thousand dollars are to be due in one
              year.

            Mr. BUSKIRK resuming. The Indianapolis proposition is to give what? To give the
              Northwestern Christian University? I would like to know if the Trustees of the
              Northwestern will surrender their buildings? Or is it that the Agricultural College
              may have the privilege to occupy their buildings, and to be crowded out at their
              pleasure? Then the Fletcher heirs propose to give something. No doubt they are
              honorable men; but why do they not come in and put their proposition in such shape, as
              will make it an obligation with forfeiture, if they intend to carry it out? But there
              is an objection to locating this Institution in or near the city of Indianapolis or
              any other city. We all know the temptations to which youth is exposed in a large city.
              Where is the gentleman, having a boy of ten or fifteen years who would wish to send
              him here to Indianapolis, and expose him to the contaminating vices of the city? It is
              bad enough in a small town like Bloomington. But a boy of fifteen or sixteen years
              turned loose in a city-what could benected of him at twenty-one? If there was other
              objections to Indianapolis, this alone, with me, would be insuperable.

            Now Mr. Speaker, I wish to refer briefly, to the proposition from Monroe County. It
              is to give the University buildings, the laboratory, the library and the museum,
              valued at one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. The University fund, of one hundred
              thousand dollars; the University land valued at fifty thousand dollars, and the County
              donation of fifty thousand dollars-four hundred and fifty thousand dollars in all.

            The bill provides, that if the College is lofted at Bloomington, it shall be under
              the joint control of the Trustees of the State University and the Trustees of the
              Agricultural College; that they shall have the joint control of the buildings and the
              grounds, and of the whole thing; and that the act of Congress shall be carried out in
              good faith.

            Mr. GREEN. Mr. Speaker: As a Representative from the southern part of the State, I
              respectfully ask the House, that I may be heard for a few moments upon this
              question.

            On the motion of Mr. COFFROTH, it was ordered by unanimous consent, that Mr. Green be
              allowed to speak ten minutes.

            Mr. GREEN. Mr. Speaker: I would not attempt to make any discussion of this question,
              if any other gentleman from our part of the State would do so. But I will be brief. It
              is my belief sir, that we should not allow the consideration of dollars and cents to
              control us so much in this matter. And I cannot but deprecate these constant appeals
              of gentlemen against spending money. In endeavoring to locate this College, with me,
              it becomes necessary, as an element of action, that we should spend money; and we
              should do it liberally. Local interests should not control.

            This grant of Congress was conceived in the interests of the laboring classes. And if
              the College is located in any other interest; the location would be violative of the
              spirit of the act of Congress. I have compared the Agricultural reports from twelve
              States of the Union. [Here Mr. G. spoke rapidly, giving various statistical statements
              in figures derived from these reports. Many of these States he said, have experimental
              farms connected with these Agricultural Institutions and he would be ready to vote
              liberal appropriations to this Agricultural College, located in any part of the State,
              where the interests of the industries of the State would be subserved and the design
              of the act of Congress would be carried out. But he would not be willing to see it
              connected with any other literary or scientific Institution, because that would be to
              disconnect and take it away from the experimental farm.

            He answered the objection, that many students would give their preference to the
              literary Institutions; by reference to the said Agricultural reports, wherein it was
              shown, that the course of instruction in those Agricultural Institutions was
              sufficiently thorough.]

            The House then proceeded to ballot for the location of the Indiana Agricultural
              College, conformably to the order embraced in Mr. Dunh's resolution-Mr. Stewart

            SUPPLEMENTARY TO BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
              VOLUME ELEVENTH.
            Location of the Indiana Agricultural College ---- Mr. Stein's
               Bill, S. 156 ---- Debate in
              Continuation.
            IN SENATE.

            
              TUESDAY, May 4, 1869.
            

            [IN CONTINUATION p. 153.--FIRST
                COLUW.]

             The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR announced the special order for this hour (10 o'clock
              a. m.) being Mr. Stein's bill [S. 156]
              accepting certain donations from John Purdue and others, and locating and naming the
              college contemplated by the act of Congress, approved July 2, 1862; providing for its
              organization and management; adding a member to the Trustees of the Indiana
              Agricultural College, and changing the corporate name of said Trustees, and declaring
              an emergency. [Locating it in Tippecanoe county, and naming it "Purdue
              University." See a digest of the bill on page 250-1 of this volume of the BREVIER REPORTS.]

            Mr. HANNA had moved to recommit the bill with instructions to strike out from the
              enacting clause and substitute therefor new matter, locating the Agricultural College
              at Bloomington, in connection with the State University.

            Mr. MORGAN said:

            Mr. President: I have always been in favor of an Agricultural College being
              established in connection with our State University. I have been in favor of it for
              this reason: There is nothing to be taught in an Agricultural College that should not
              be taught in every good College or University in the land. To establish an
              Agricultural College you have got to establish one with professors teaching the same
              branches that are taught in all the colleges of the land. In establishing an
              Agricultural College at Bloomington, the only thing I can see that is necessary to
              make the State University an Agricultural College is to expend a certain amount of
              money for an experimental farm - a large farm with good soil and well adapted for
              experimenting with all the serials. And it should be located where there are
              facilities for procuring the best breeds of animals, raising them and spreading them
              out among the farmers of the country. It is very important to every citizen of the
              State that the Agricultural interest should be husbanded; that it should be fostered
              and brought to its fullest and most perfect position.

            In establishing a College it will be necessary, therefore, to have a man to oversee
              an experimental farm, and as far as professorships are concerned, the only thing that
              would be required by the interests of the College would be to have the very best
              talent to fill the chairs of Philosophy, Chemistry and Mineralogy.

            Now if we are to establish another University, and have a sickly, weakly institution
              forced upon the State, to be supported by appropriations from the State Treasury, it
              will continue a drain upon the Treasury for generations to come. If the State of
              Indiana will take hold and build up one institution they can do a great deal better,
              and a great deal more for the interests of the State than by having half a dozen. The
              more we have, the worse we will be off because it will cost twice as much to support
              two as one, and probably the two will have no more students than the one.

            I am decidedly in favor of uniting this Agricultural College with the State
              University, and if the friends of another locality shall overpower the friends of the
              University I would be for removing the State University from Bloomington to that
              locality; and let us build up an institution that will be an honor to the State.

            If we are going to build up an Agricultural College and nothing else I would say,
              there is  nothing a farmer should know that every
              person should not know. There are some practical things about farming that it is not
              necessary for a merchant or a mechanic to know, but the general details every person
              should be acquainted with.

            I am in favor of but one institution. If Senators are determined not to unite this
              Agricultural College with the State University I say let us give it to some
              institution of learning;-give it to them to build up an Agricultural College on their
              own hook; and not make the State liable to be called upon to give money for its
              support from year to year. It is better to build up but one institution. One professor
              can lecture just as well to five hundred students as to fifty. I am decidedly in favor
              of making but one institution instead of two.

            Mr. GRAY. Mr. President: I came up as a passive Senator on this question at the
              beginning of the last session. I was passive because my constituents were making no
              petitions upon this question; and I believe they have no preference as to where this
              College shall be located. I was consequently left free to vote as my own judgment
              dictated. When this question was up at, the last session I voted seven times for
              Bloomington, several times for Marion county and several times for Greenfield, Hancock
              county. I voted for wherever I thought my vote would be likely to locate it. I felt
              but little interest in this location from the fact that the bids were nearly all of
              the same character. But when I heard the proposition of the Hon. John Purdue read I
              remarked at the time, that I thought I would vote to locate it there, from the fact
              that the offer was made by an individual against which no objection could be made. I
              agree with the Senator from Sullivan [Mr. Hanna] that the appropriations made by the
              county Commissioners to secure this location are very uncertain. I know the counties
              are expecting great results from it-they are expecting an increased population to
              result from its location in their midst, and they expect a large enhancement of real
              estate in their vicinity, but I am of opinion that they will be somewhat
              disappointed.

            But in case of the county propositions there is nothing easier than for some tax
              paver to enjoin the treasury and prevent the donation being made. I think the
              individual proposition infinitely the best that has been made. Not only because it is
              made by an individual but also because that individual is a man of honor, integrity,
              enterprise and means. But, sir, this is the smallest consideration why I should vote
              to locate this College in Tippecanoe county. I understand that Mr. Purdue is anxious
              to do something that will cause the people to remember him hereafter; therefore he is
              interested in the success of this University. And when John Purdue is interested
              success is more than likely to follow. Thus we will have connected with this College
              individual enterprise-a man who has his heart set upon it and desiring to make it a
              grand success.

            And there is no telling how much money Mr. Purdue may spend in the furtherance of
              this, the favorite object of his declining years Putting it under the fostering care
              of Mr. Purdue may give the State of Indiana one of the best institutions in the west.
              In this case I have no reason to expect that this College will come here time after
              time knocking at the door of the treasury for additional appropriations. I believe
              that putting this College under the fostering case of such a wealthy individual as Mr.
              Purdue may prevent its coming here in after time asking for donations from the State
              treasury. I know that when we locate this Agricultural College if there is not
              connected with it anything like individual enterprise it will stand in the same
              relation as other institutions of the State and its Directors will not have that
              concern for its success that an individual would have who is directly interested in
              its success.I am also impelled to vote for Tippecannoe-county, because the House of
              Representative has located this College there; and if we locate it this session we
              must agree with the House-. In all probability there is but one more Legislature that
              can take this matter into consideration and if they have no better success that, past
              Legislatures there will be a poor prospect for its location at all. As I understand
              it, the donation by the General Government is for a particular purpose and for no
              other. Other States are going to establish separate. Agricultural Colleges, and I do
              not see why Indiana cannot do the same. I am as anxious-to build up a University at
              Bloomington as any other person on this floor, but 1 look upon Agricultural education
              as being different from all the branches of learning taught at Bloomington, and the
              probabilities are that the Agricultural College would receive an unfair consideration
              there. Therefore I am in favor of establishing it as a separate institution where it
              may be given those efforts necessary to a fair trial.

            Mr. RICE. Unless there is practical knowledge taught in an Agricultural College I
              have no definite idea of what such a school should be.

            Mr. GRAY. I understand that when an Agricultural College is established everything
              that is necessary to make it a success is taught. As a matter of course, I cannot tell
              everything that will be taught in such an institution and I suppose no Senator on this
              floor can. The people of the United States being ignorant on this subject the National
              Congress has made  a donation to learn the people
              in that direction.

            Mr. CRAVENS. Mr. President: I do not want to discuss this question for my views are
              well known. The amendment of the Senator from Sullivan [Mr. Hanna] is altogether in
              the line of my preference; and I will ask the Senator, to save time, to modify his
              motion so that the question may come first direct upon the amendment proposed by him.
              I desire a test vote upon this question. My reason is this: as far as all local
              propositions are concerned, it seems to me they have not the weight of a feather. The
              State of Indiana is a bidder for this Agricultural College and the State has the
              disposition of this matter. The State has but one institution of learning and, as has
              been well said, by the incorporation of this fund with the University fund the State I
              can make a creditable institution out of the State University. The State is the best
              bidder in the market. Her resources and her ambition to make it what it should be will
              far exceed any locality in Indiana. If upon a test question it is decided that the
              State will not add this fund to the State University, then I have my preference. There
              is but one valid bid before the Senate as far as localities are concerned, and that is
              the bid of an individual who has the ability to carry out his designs and the ambition
              to back his ability.

            Mr. HANNA. I was laboring under the impression that I could not offer it as an
              amendment. If I can offer it as an amendment I have no objection.

            Mr. STEIN. Mr. Presideet: As far as the State University is concerned I confess to as
              great an interest in it as any Senator upon this floor. My past votes upon this floor
              clearly establish the fact that I am a friend to the State University. It is but a
              short time since I cast a vote here for making an allowance of twenty-five thousand
              dollars to that institution; and I stand here to-day willing to vote as large an
              allowance to it as any Senator. We have a bill on our files which has passed to the
              second reading allowing ten thousand dollars, and I stand ready to vote for that as
              the best I can get.

            But Senators should understand that we are called upon to give practical effect to
              this donation by Congress, and the past sessions of our General Assembly show the
              difficulty of doing it. No practical effect has yet been given to this donation by the
              General Government. On the fourth day of July 1872, our days of grace expire, in which
              event, unless some action is taken by Congress we become responsible to the United
              Slates for a return of the national bounty. Under the circumstances I conceive it to
              be of the highest importance that we proceed to the location of this college. We are
              here possibly in the last week of our session; this bill is a Senate bill, and,
              admitting its passage through this Chamber it must be sent to the other end of the
              Capitol and possibly pass three readings on three successive days there; hence it
              becomes us to make dispatch if the College is located this season. And now I come to
              the practical question: Is it possible that the location can be made at Bloomington?
              The chances are altogether to the contrary. A bill was introduced into the House
              several weeks since which passed the consideration of a Committee, locating the
              College at that point--

            Mr. HANNA (interrupting.) Mr. President: The Senator has no right to disclose to the
              Senate what the House has done.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR I believe it is held to be improper to refer to the action of
              the other House.

            Mr. STEIN. I shall be excused then from making an allusion to the action of the
              House. Yet I presume I may safely say that 1 do not believe the Bloomington
              proposition can prevail in the House. I suppose I am in order in saying that And if
              there be a reasonable expectation that such a proposition after prevailing here should
              fail in the other Chamber why simply waste an effort that will result in nothing at
              all this session but the frustration of any attempt in the way of locating this
              College. I therefore shall oppose such a proposition on the ground of
              impracticability. And furthermore I am not certain whether, under the law of Congress,
              we can amalgamate this fund with the University at Bloomington. The act of Congress
              says:

            Any State which may take and claim the benefit of the provisions of this act shall
              provide, within-five years, at least not less than one College, as described in the
              fourth section of this act, or the grant to such State shall cease; and said State
              shall be bound to pay the United States the amount received by any lands previously
              sold, and that the title to purchaser under the State shall be valid.

            What is meant by that ? There have been in other States wise heads who hold it to
              mean to support an independent institution. The proposition before us seems to merge
              this fund in the State University and give that institution the benefit of the
              increase arising therefrom. If this be not its intent then the design must be to found
              a separate establishment at Bloomington in conformity with the manifest purpose of the
              act of Congress. But why do this unless Bloomington, or its county, (Monroe) offers
              inducements overriding those tendered by other localities? Now the inducements of my
              county are infinitely greater than those coining from Monroe County. We have only from
              that locality an offer of fifty thousand dollars, I believe, And I think they are
              infinitely greater than those form Marion County. But the consideration of offers firm
              Monroe is not a question before us now; as the 
              resolution in favor of the Bloomington location based itself simply upon the propriety
              of fortifying the State University with the Agricultural College fund, irrespective of
              any auxiliary bonus from Monroe County.

            Mr. HANNA. Mr. President: I said nothing with reference to the proposition from
              Tippecanoe or Marion counties. I said whenever the matter turned upon either of these
              points it would be time enough to discuss them. Senators have assumed that this
              proposition ought to be voted down because better offers were made from other places.
              This necessitates my saying something with reference to that point. There has been
              nothing said in favor of the proposition from Marion County; the friends of that
              proposition seem to be silent. Therefore I shall refer to the proposition offered by
              Tippecanoe County as published before us. The first section of this bill is defective
              in this.

            Mr. H. read the first section as follows :

            That the donation offered by John Purdue, as set-forth und communicated to the
              present General Assembly in the message of the Governor on the 16th day of April,
              1869, and the donations offered by the county of Tippecanoe, and the Trustees of the
              Battle Ground Institute, and the Trustees of the Battle Ground Institute of the
              Methodist Episcopal Church, as set forth and communicated to the General Assembly at
              its last session in the message of the Governor of the twenty-seventh day of January,
              1869, be, and the same are, hereby accepted by the State of Indiana.

            The first section accepts all the donations offered by the Trustees of the Battle
              Ground Institute and the Trustees of the Battle Ground Institute of the Methodist
              Episcopal Church and all the donations of John Purdue, and all the donations of
              Tippecanoe County. Now I say these offers are distinct and separate. The offer made by
              John Purdue and Tippecanoe County was distinct and separate from the offer by the
              Battle Ground Institutes, and cannot be amalgamated.

            Mr. STEIN (interposing.) The proposition of John Purdue is to donate one hundred and
              fifty thousand dollars. It is possible that a majority of the Trustees of this College
              may locate the institution at the Battle Ground ; and in that event it will give us
              the benefit of that donation; hence in order to provide for the contingencies of
              location it became necessary to accept all.

            Mr. HANNA. Suppose they don't locate it at the Battle Ground: and I understand,
              outside of the record here, (as Mr. Purdue requires that he shall be a member of the
              Board of Trustees) that he expects the. Agricultural College to be located south of
              the Tippecanoe river, nearly adjoining the city of Lafayette, and not at the Battle
              Ground, so that excludes the idea of taking into consideration the proposition made by
              the Battle Ground Institutes. Therefore I say the first section is defective.

            In considering the propositions made the Battleground we ought not to take into
              consideration the donations proposed by Mr. Mehary or Mr. Purdue. Mr. Mehary offers
              three hundred and twenty acres of land at Shawnee Mound, in said county, valued at one
              hundred dollars per acre, on condition that the college be located on the same.
              Neither of these offers have any connection with the Battle Ground offer. I say that
              advisedly.

            We ought to consider the proposition of Mr Purdue, standing isolated and alone,
              except perhaps the offer of Tippecanoe County of fifty thousand dollars which amounts
              to nothing. What is the offer of John Purdue ? To pay fifteen thousand dollars a year
              for ten years You spend fifteen thousand dollars a year for ten years in building and
              it will take all he offers to build, and then you don't have a building costing
              as much as the normal school building at Terre Haute. True he says he will give one
              hundred acres of land, but you cannot sell that. Then his whole offer is fifteen
              thousand dollars for ten years, and it will take it all to build the building, and not
              be enough at that, and it will be ten years before it is ready to be occupied for the
              purpose of an Agricultural College. You can't take the fund i which comes from
              the donation of Congress to build a building with. Then you must look to the offer of
              Mr. Purdue and the manner in which it is to be paid.

            I do not desire to say anything disparaging of the offers from these two very liberal
              gentlemen ; but I say where the buildings are already erected by the State-and they
              exist at Bloomington-this Agricultural College should be located there. I would
              rather, as far as I am individually concerned, that it should be located in this city.
              You have either got to extend a helping hand to the State University I or it cannot be
              made a good institution. It don't compare with the institution of Michigan or
              with those of surrounding states. You have got to extend a helping hand to it in some
              form or abandon it.

            The idea I have got is this: that this fund would give to the Bloomington University
              that much help; and it would give it character abroad. If the time shall come when I
              w' have to vote between the proposition from Indianapolis and particular
              localities then of course I shall decide as I think will be for the public good. As I
              am now speaking I am not looking to any particular place. No matte where the State
              University would be my language would be the same.

            Mr. ROBINSON of Madison. Mr. President: I believe this is the third session that the
              question this College location as been discussed here. I think, as far as question has
              been considered, heretofore I have not taken part in the discussion, but simply cast
                 my vote. To be consistent with my votes I
              propose to discuss the propositions before us now for a few moments. In the first
              place the argument used by the friends of Bloomington we have a College there and in
              that College all the branches of learning usually taught in Agricultural Colleges are
              now taught. It seems to me that Senators have a mistaken idea as to the purposes of
              this grant by Congress and when they argue that this College should be located at
              Bloomington because the other branches of learning are taught at the State University
              I am led to think that they have not read the laws of Congress upon that subject. The
              fourth section of the act donating [his fund to the several States reads as
              follows:

            "SEC. 4. And be it farther enacted, that all money derived
              from the sale of the lands aforesaid, by the State to which the lands are apportioned,
              and from the sale of the land scrip hereinbefore provided for shall be invested in
              stocks of the United States or some other safe stocks, yielding no less than five per
              centum upon the par value of said stocks, and that the money so invested shall
              constitute a perpetual fund, the capital of which shall remain former undiminished,
              except so far as may be provided in section fifth of this act, and the interest of
              which shall be inevitably appropriated by each State which may take and claim the
              benefit of this let, to the endowment, support, and maintenance of it least one
              college, where the leading object shall be, without excluding other scientific and
              classical studies, and including military tactics, to teach such branches of learning
              as are related to agriculture and the mechanical arts, in such mariner as the
              legislatures of the States may respectively prescribe, in order to promote the liberal
              and practical education of the industrial classes in the several pursuits and
              professions in life.

            Now Mr. President that is the object of this donation, and still for three sessions
              we have had an argument for locating this College at Bloomington because an
              Agricultural College excludes the teaching of these other sciences. The express
              provision of this grant is that in this College shall be taught all the branches that
              no branch shall be excluded, but Agriculture shall be made a specialty. That is all
              there is in the provision, yet gentlemen argue because the Bloomington University
              teaches these other branches, therefore this Agricultural College would not be
              separate because it teaches nothing else. Now, sir, as to their other argument; they
              say Bloomington University is the University of the State. That is true enough, sir.
              It has cost the State of Indiana, and is now costing, and perhaps will for all time to
              come cost perhaps thirty thousand dollars a year. Now this section of the act provides
              that this shall be the endowment of the Agricultural College. As a matter of course
              the principal is not drawn upon twenty-five thousand dollars is properly the endowment
              fund. Now I maintain under the provisions alluded to by the Senator from Tippecanoe,
              that we have no right, under the at of Congress to connect this Agricultural College
              with any University of this State. This whole act goes upon the principle that the
              State of Indiana is to establish a College-

            Mr. HANNA (interrupting.) I would ask the Senator if a University is not an
              aggregation of Colleges?

            Mr. ROBINSON of Madison. Certainly, but a University does not necessarily embrace a
              college in which is taught agriculture and the mechanics arts or military tactics. The
              bill has no reference to this.

            Now, Mr. President, as I have stated, this question has been considered here for
              three sessions and I have voted in favor of the location in Tippecanoe county. They
              have shown us that this College there should be made a success. The county of
              Tippecanoe has offered much the best considerations and inducements for the location
              there. I remember in 1867 when her citizens were here manifesting their wonted
              enterprize and zeal for the purpose of securing the location of the College there,
              about the time the Legislature was prepared to take a vote the County of Marion came
              in with a proposition of one hundred thousand dollars. I submit to Senators for what
              was that proposition made? Every Senator well knows it was for no other purpose but to
              suspend the location till 1869; we know gentlemen interested in the Marion county
              location made a report to that effect. It was not to locate the College, but that it
              might put off the location until another session; and now, after the matter has been
              investigated by a Committee and they see that Tippecanoe county is still in earnest,
              the Committee regarding her proposition as the only legitimate one now before this
              body and recommending the passage of the bill locating this College there, then
              Marrion county comes in with an additional offer of seventy-five thousand dollars; and
              I am told you may go and search the records of Marion county in vain, and you cannot
              find that proposition upon record to-day. What is the purpose of this? Is it not that
              this location shall be postponed so that we will be compelled, when the enterprise of
              the people is exhaused, the people of Indiana will do, as they have done in the past,
              give it to them as a gratuity?

            Marion county has her proposition to give one hundred and seventy-five thousand
              dollars in bonds. What are her bonds worth? If good faith were preserved the county
              might pay them, but suppose some tax payer steps in and asks the Court to enjoin their
              payment? I ask what authority has Marion county to issue one hundred and seventy-five
              thousand dollars in bonds for such purposes? It is said there may be an act passed to
              legitimize and authorize the issue of such bonds. There is no act to authorize the
              county of Marion to  issue one hundred and
              seventy-five thousand dollars in bonds.

            Now here is a plain, tangible and fair proposition coming from Tippecanoe County. It
              is one that the Legislature can enforce. It is that Mr. Purdue will give one hundred
              and fifty thousand dollars conditioned upon the location of this Agricultural College
              in Tippecanoe county. And suppose the persons having charge of the location determine
              to locate it at the Battle Ground, in addition to this one hundred and fifty thousand
              dollars the Trustees of the Battle Ground Institute tender their buildings and
              grounds, and the Trustees of the Battle Ground Institute of the Methodist Episcopal
              Church tender their buildings and grounds, which they have the power to do. Then here
              are propositions a-mounting to ninety thousand dollars and one hundred and fifty
              thousand dollars, making a total of two hundred and forty thousand dollars which is
              legal and which the law would authorize the collection of.

            Mr. RICE (interposing.) The Senator says that some tax payer might step in and enjoin
              the collection of the appropriation made by Marion County to secure the location of
              the College. What would prevent a tax payer in Tippecanoe County from stopping the
              payment of the fifty thousand dollars appropriated by that county on the same
              conditions?

            Mr. ROBINSON, of Madison. Nothing under Heaven.

            Mr. STEIN. If the Senator will permit me I desire to meet that question right here by
              offering the following assurances-a written guarantee-which will be deposited with the
              Secretary of State, and which I desire read.

            The Secretary read a written guarantee that the fifty thousand dollar donation
              proposed by the Commissioners of Tippecanoe county should be paid as agreed, which
              guarantee was signed by H. W. Chase, Martin L. Pierce, John Purdue, Mr. Sample, Mr.
              Reynolds and others.

            Mr. STEIN. And I will add my own name. All with the exception of myself are worthy
              citizens of my county. By this paper we guarantee that our county subscription will be
              made good.

            Mr. HANNA. What is the consideration for the guarantee?

            Mr. STEIN. In consideration of the location of this College in Tippecanoe County. It
              is a valid and legal consideration.

            Mr. ROBINSON, of Madison, (resuming.) As to this guarantee now introduced by the
              Senator from Tippecanoe [Mr. Stein] I do not know whether, as the Senator from
              Sullivan [Mr. Hanna] suggests, but that it may be here,as no consideration for
              it--

            Mr. STEIN (interposing.) It is expressly stated that the consideration is the
              location the Agricultural College in Tippecanoe county. 

            Mr. ROBINSON of Madison. But I without any consideration, the gentlemen signed that
              paper are well enough known the State, and the fifty thousand dollars guaranteed by
              them will be paid. But suppose the Tippecanoe Battleground proposition is rejected,
              you still have two hundred thousand dollars and one hundred acres of land. Then here
              are four legal propositions these people of Tippecanoe have presented to us.

            Objection has been made that this one hundred and fifty thousand dollars is to be
              paid in enstallments fifteen thousand dollars yearly but I see from this paper before
              me that Senator Stein has notified the Legislature that Mr. Purdue will make the
              payments in such sums and at such times as it may direct. I think, without prejudice
              on this subject, as far as my part of the State is concerned, they will be content
              with the location in Tippecanoe county. I believe I never have heard of any general
              expression on this subject from my people, but they desire that this College shall be
              located at some point this session; and Tippecanoe county has certainly manifested a
              zeal and energy that is entitled to consideration. Therefore as at the two previous
              sessions I shall favor the location of this College there.

            Mr. RICE. Mr. President: The proposition before the Senate is the location of the
              Agricultural College as contemplated by the statute of July 2, 1862. Now let us
              understand what this statute means, first.

            Mr. R. reads:

            And be it further enacted, That all moneys derived from the sale of the lands
              aforesaid by the States to which the lands are apportioned, and from the sales of land
              scrip hereinbefore provided for, shall be invested in stocks of the United States, or
              of the States, or some other safe stocks, yielding not less than five per centum upon
              the par value of said stocks; arid that the moneys so invested shall constitute a
              perpetual fund, the capital of which shall remain forever undiminished, (except so far
              as may be provided in section fifth of this act,) and the interest of which shall be
              inviolably appropriated, by each State which may take and claim the benefit'of
              this act, to the endowment, support, and maintenance of at least one college where the
              leading object shall lie, without excluding other scientific and classical studies,
              and including military tactics, to teach such branches of learning arts as are related
              to Agriculture and the the mechanic arts, in such manner as the Legislatures of the
              States may respectively prescribe, in order to promote the liberal and practical
              education of the industrial classes in the several pursuits and professions in
              life.

            Now what is the object of this statute? It is to build up in each State a College for
              three objects; to teach such branches as are related to Agriculture and the mechanic
              arts and military science. Of course it don't exclude other branches, but you
              can't use one cent of this interest in endowing a professorship  other branch that don't teach agriculture of the
              mechanic arts, or military science.

            The great point to be settled by this Senate is: What kind of a school are you going
              to build up? I take it from reading this act that it related to these three subjects
              and nothing else, and you can't put one dime or one cent either in the erection
              of a building or the endowment of a professorship, the leading object of which
              professorship does not tend to teaching agriculture, mechanic arts or military
              science.

            Mr. ROBINSON of Madison (interposing) Do I understand you to say that under this act
              we have no right to introduce any other branches?

            Mr. RICE. I say you have no right to endow a professorship to teach the
              languages.

            Mr. ROBINSON of Madison. I understand that you favor locating this College in
              connection with the University at Bloomington.

            Mr. RICE I do not know how the Senator understood that. I have not come to that
              yet.

            Mr. ROBINSON of Madison. I understood so from your acts last session.

            Mr. RICE. The Senator has no reason for understanding any such thing yet. I am
              talking about this law of Congress and how to construe it. If I have put a fair
              interpretation of this law how are you going to build up a University embracing only
              these three branches? I need not refer to the fact, for it has been reiterated, and
              gentlemen have been defied to point out a successful institution of the kind in the
              new or old world. They don't live by themselves. It aint in the nature of things
              that they can live by themselves. It is a question of relieving the people of the
              State from an additional burden of taxation,and that is the main reason why I shall
              vote for the amendment. Take the Agricultural College to Bloomington where there is a
              University perfect and in tact-where the professorships are endowed and a building
              furnished; and you will have the whole fund in tact to build up an Agricultural
              Department. And the reason I am not for its location in any other place is simply
              this: it will take all your fund-the interest of two hundred and thirty thousand
              dollars at five per cent to endow the processors' chairs of these three
              departments. It will take all the fund to get necessary apparatus to experiment in
              Agriculture and the scientific arts. Where is your other fund that goes to make part
              of the Purdue University? Where are you going to get money from to endow your
              professorships?

            Mr. ROBINSON of Madison, (interposing.)You ask the question: Where are we going to
              |et a fund to endow the professorships in the Purdue University? Now I ask: Where are
              you going to get a fund to endow the professorships at Bloomington?

            Mr. RICE. They are endowed.

            Mr. ROBINSON of Madison. Where is the fund?

            Mr. RICE. It is at interest and paying the professors at Bloomington now. The State
              University lived on her fund till two years ago.

            Mr. ROBINSON, of Madison. Has it run out now?

            Mr. RICE. No sir, it is there. This amendment contemplates an appropriation for the
              State University till 1872, when the amendment proposes to strike it out. That part I
              am not in favor of. I say foster your State Institution. Its building was destroyed by
              fire a few years ago, but the people of the County gallantly built it up for the State
              again, and it stands a monument to the friends of learning in Monroe county. You
              propose to shear her of this fund; and propose where the people are loaded down and
              burdened with taxation, both State and National, to start an institution which shall
              sap the revenue of the State every year, to support the very thing you are getting up.
              You cannot put up your buildings with the Purdue grant, magnificent as it is, and I
              honor the man for it.

            My people have never canvassed this question, but they sent me here to take care of
              their interests, and while here I am going to do it. I do not propose to vote to
              create another Institution which shall be a leach on the State, when we have a dozen
              hanging on us now. We have an institution of learning perfect in all its parts which
              is in successful operation. I shall vote for the State University-the child of the
              State-until she goes down, and then I will look around for the next best thing.

            You propose to establish an Agricultural College; and the fight now lies between
              Tippecanoe county and Marion county. You have got from Mr. Purdue a proposition to
              donate one hundred and fifty thousand dollars in ten years; but if it were proffered
              all now it would not furnish the buildings necessary. The interest won't more
              than support the three professorships which the act of Congress contemplates. Then to
              carry out the institution, I take it as a proposition no Senator will deny, that the
              institution can't live by itself-it has got to be connected with a University.
              You propose to establish an institution that in the next five years will take from
              three to five hundred thousand dollars to build up, and in doing this you propose to
              put down your State University now in successful operation at Bloomington.

            How does your account of appropriations stand? you propose to vote eighty thousand
                 dollars for the Hospital for the Insane; about
              forty thousand dollars for the Blind; about as much more for the Deaf and Dumb; fifty
              thousand dollars for the Soldiers Home; fifty thousand dollars for the Reform School;
              seventy nine thousand dollars nearly for the School at Terre Haute; and as if that is
              not sufficient you propose to throw away what you have got-your University which you
              are bound to foster-you propose to throw that aside and get up another pet Institution
              which shall tax the people and bleed them worse than they are. I propose to lop off
              these leeches as far as we can, some of them are necessary, however. But when there is
              no necessity to throw away an investment the State has been making for forty years and
              it is proposed to create a new one which will cost the State from three to five
              hundred thousand dollars, I fail to see the necessity for it. These are the reasons I
              shall vote for the substitute : because it is but justice to the people you and I
              represent. These are all the reasons I think of for the present. I wish Senators who
              favor retrenchment and reform to look well to their record in the future before they
              cast their votes to throw aside the State University. I have no word against
              Tippecanoe County. I honor her citizens. I think Mr. Purdue has acted nobly, and in a
              gallant manner. I like his spirit. And I like the interest that has been taken in this
              matter in Hancock County, in this County and in every other county which^desires to
              build up a creditable institution of learning; but I will not vote to tax the people
              when it is not necessary.

            Mr. BELLAMY. Mr. President: I do not know that the proposition is directly before
              this Senate to establish an Agricultural College in Marion County; but if I avail
              myself of the latitude others have taken I presume I shall not trespass upon the
              courtesy of this body. I have nothing to say against the wonderful child of the State
              alluded to by the Senator from Parke [Mr. Rice.] The proposition of the Senator is
              that we will relieve the State of the expense of teaching additional departments by
              locating this College at Blooming-ton. We will meet that very difficulty by locating
              this Agricultural College with the University in the city of Indianapolis. The several
              branches of learning usually taught in Colleges are being taught successfully at the
              North-Western Christian University at the present time. When we locate this College at
              the North-Western Christian University we obviate every objection expressed by the
              Senator from Parke.

            Mr. RICE (interposing.) That is a sectarian school, and will continue to be such.
              This is a non-sectarian school and was established by the fostering care of the
              State.

            Mr. BELLAMY. It makes but very little difference whether a man acquires his education
              at a Methodist, Presbyterian, Baptist or Christian University. The proposition is that
              the school shall be controlled by a Board of Directors equal with them.

            Mr. MORGAN (interposing.) Would you consider it in accordance with the Constitution
              to draw money from the Treasury and put it in a sectarian institution?

            Mr. BELLAMY. There comes the Constitution again! The Constitution has nothing to do
              with this question. So far as drawing money from the Treasury is concerned, we are to
              use this money proffered by Congress; - it is not drawn from the State Treasury.

            Now what are the inducements? The only two questions are: Its location and the
              inducements offered for its location. As to the point of location Marion County is
              decidedly preferable, as it is a central point and one easy of access. As far as that
              is concerned it must be conceded that Marion County has decidedly the advantage. Now
              the only question is as to the inducement offered by any point. How does Tippecanoe
              compare with Marion County in this particular? The Senator from Madison candidly tells
              me that I don't understand the bill when I say that the propositions of
              Tippecanoe County don't go together. I say I speak advisedly; I understand the
              bill, and they don't go together, Mr. Purdue offers one hundred acres of land
              near Lafayette and one hundred and fifty thousand dollars payable in ten years, and it
              is not Mr. Purdue's wish that this College shall be located at the Tippecanoe
              Battleground: so that proposition by the Battleground Institutes was laid aside. This
              bill makes Mr. Purdue a member of the Board of Trustees, and puts the location of this
              College in his power; and he expressed himself before the Committee that he did net
              desire it located at the Battleground. Now what would you receive from Tippecanoe
              County? one hundred and fifty thousand dollars from Mr. Purdue and fifty thousand
              dollars from the County: that is two hundred thousand dollars, to be received at the
              end of ten years. If located in Marion County you would receive one hundred and ninety
              thousand dollars in cash : two hundred thousand dollars is all that would be received
              from Tippecanoe County at the end of ten years. But that is not all the donation to be
              received from Marion County. Her bonds will draw six per cent, interest, which at then
              d often years would amount to one hundred and forty thousand more; which will make
              three hundred and thirty thousand dollars from Marion County in aid of this
              Instituiton outside of the donations of land and the buildings of the Northwestern
              Christian University.

            Mr. STEIN (interposing.) In reference to this donation of Marion County: does it
              amount to more than one hundred and seventy-five
              thousand dollars?

            Mr. BELLAMY. I think it does; and these amounts are drawing six percent. interest,
              and the Purdue donation does not.

            Mr. STEIN. I understand all that; but where do you get you building fund from?

            Mr. BELLAMY. For five years we will need no building fund. The interest upon one
              hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars of bonds will constitute almost as large a
              yearly dividend for a building fund as the proposition coming from Tippecanoe County.
              Not only that, we have five years in which to accumulate this fund, and with this
              proposition pending before them the trustees can easily acquire sufficient means to
              erect all the buildings that may be required without difficulty. That is no objection
              in the way. The proposition coming from Marion County, outside of the land and the
              generous proposition of the Christian University, will net in the aggregate, three
              hundred and thirty thousand dollars which this institution will receive in the way of
              endowment instead of two hundred thousand dollars from Tippecanoe County.

            Mr. RICE (interposing) Was there any minority report on this bill?

            Mr. BELLAMY There was not. This additional seventy-five thousand dollars
              appropriation from Marion County was not in. That was the last straw that broke the
              camel's back of Tippecanoe County; and I think it is an additional inducement for
              the location here. I offered a motion to refer this bill back to the Committee after
              this proposition was made, in order that they might regard it in connection with all
              the other propositions. Therefore it now comes in as a question to be discussed as the
              Committee's report does not cover the ground contemplated in this.

            As to the legality of the bonds issued by Marion County: - and upon that I suppose
              most Senators will base their ground of objection: - the Senator from Madison insists
              that we can't legalize them. I want to ask the Senator from Madison, or any other
              Senator, if his County did not issue bonds to pay soldiers during the war by the
              hundreds of thousands, and did not the Legislature legalize them? If these bonds were
              legal, if the Legislature did a proper act; if they were Constitutional, I would like
              to know why the bonds issued by Marion County are not just as proper?

            Mr. STEIN (interposing) Can the Senator assure the Senate that the Board of County
              Commissioners have passed an order voting this seventy-five thousand dollars?

            Mr. BELLALY. All we can have is the official order of the Board of Commissioners. 

            Mr. STEIN. I was at the County Record's office yesterday and found no such
              order.

            The paper presented here don't certify to any official act of theirs. Let it be
              read.

            Mr. BELLAMY. The proposition of the Northwestern Christian University, and the
              proposed donation, of lands have been sufficiently ventilated for the Senate to have a
              proper knowledge of them.

            Mr. STEIN. Mr. President: I move to lay the motion to recommit on the table.

            The yeas and nays having been demanded by two Senators, in compliance with a
              constitutional provision they were ordered and I taken, resulting-yeas 27 nay 10-as
              follows:

            
              
                
                  YEAS-Messrs, Andrews, Armstrong, Beardsley, Bellamy,
                    Bradley, Carson, Case, Caven. Church, Eliott, Fosdick, Gifford, Gray, Green,
                    Hadley, Hamilton, Hess, Hooper, Jacquess, Kinley, Reynolds, Robinson of Madison,
                    Robinson of Decatur, Scott, Sherrod, Stein and Turner-27.

                  NAYS-Messrs, Bird, Cravens, Fisher, Hanna, Humphreys, Lee,
                    Montgomery, Morgan, Rice and Taggart-10.
                
              
            

            Pending the roll call-

            Mr. CRAVENS, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called said: I want to
              vote for this motion and I want to vote against it. I want to lay the motion to
              recommit on the table but not the amendment, so I shall have to vote "no."So
              the motion was agreed to.

            And then-

            The Senate took a recess till two o'clock p. m.

            
              AFTERNOON SESSION.

              Mr. RICE asked unanimous consent to insert a section that the State of Indiana
                shall never be called upon to make any appropriations for the erection of buildings,
                buying grounds, or endowing professorships.

              Mr. STEIN objected.

              The bill was then read the third time.

              Mr. STEIN made an ineffectual demand for the previous question.

              Mr. CAVIN. Mr. President: The assertion that Marion brought in propositions to
                delay the location of this College is wholly unauthorized. I am not able to say at
                what time the proposition of Indianapolis was brought in here; for I believe the
                Journals do not show, neither does the BREVIER  REPORTS. On the first day of March, 1867, the bill to locate this College in
                the county of Tippecanoe was indefinitely postponed, [see page 356 BREVIER REPORTS, vol IX, ] but the Legislature did not
                adjourn till the 11 day of March. How then could Marion county have delayed this
                location?

              Mr. STEIN (interposing.) At the time the Committee made a report on the
                Agricultural College bill at that session Judge Niles presented a minority report
                which is printed on pages 237 and 238 of the BREVIER REPORTS of 1867, and it closses off by saying: 

              

              Surely there can be no injury from some further delay in order that the opinion of
                our constituents may be fully matured and find definite expresssion.

              Judge Niles' name is signed to this report and he was the champion of the
                Marion county interest. I always claimed that Marion county was procrastinating, and
                it is proven by their own champion.

              Mr. CAVIN. How Judge Niles was constituted the champion of Marion county I do not
                know. I presume he presented his views and opinion as an honest man, and not as the
                champion of any interest. We discover that this Senate had our proposition seventeen
                or eighteen days at the last session, before the adjournment of the Legislature. Ten
                days before the final adjournment they indefinitely postponed the whole subject.
                Here was plenty of time to act upon the proposition. At the last session Tippecanoe
                county was--

              Mr. TURNER (interrupting.) As the Senator alludes to the motion I made last
                session, I would say this; that it was by a coalition, a partnership, or any other
                name by which it may be called, upon the part of those disposed to indefinitely
                postpone the consideration of the location of the Agricultural College and the
                Marion county interest that it was indefinitely postponed. It was agreed to by the
                Marion county interest upon the simple ground that they could not carry the
                location.

              Mr. CAVIN. I was not a party to that arrangement, and I don't propose to be
                now. I entered into no contract of that sort; and if the Senator from Marion county
                on that occasion violated his duty, I only say I regret it. But I say this Senate
                had an opportunity to locate this College. It was not done. What the motives were I
                am not disposed to inquire into. Tippecanoe county was in the field at the last
                session, and again Marrion county made a proposition. Hancock County, Putnum County
                and other Counties made offers, but none of these propositions were acted upon. But
                we find alter Marion county made a proposition for one hundred thousand dollars, at
                a later day Tippecanoe County comes back with a proposition of one hundred and fifty
                thousand dollars from John Purdue. So we find Tippecanoe behind us with some of her
                propositions. We then met them with the proposition of the Northwestern Christian
                University. At a still later day Tippecanoe county returns with one hundred acres of
                land. Then Marion County comes with an additional proposition to appropriate
                seventy-five thousand dollars in addition to the one hundred thousand dollars
                heretofore appropriated. So we find this matter of new propositions has not been
                confined to Marion County alone.

              I supposed this Senate was inviting competition; and hailed with satisfaction every
                new proposition. I suppose the true question submitted to us is: Who has the best
                before the Senate? I say if Tippecanoe county comes in with the best proposition
                to-morrow we should locate it in Tippecanoe County I suppose we have been waiting
                and inviting competition and encouraging it; and say "come into the field, we
                want to obtain as large an endowment as we can possibly obtain."

              Even conceding that Marion County had been seeking delay, the State owes that Count
                a debt of gratitude. My understanding is that the first proposition from Tippecanoe
                County was some building erected for some College or school and twenty acres of
                land; and I have been informed that the building was not suitable nor the land
                desirable. That was a proposition in 1865, and we are told that Marion County was
                here to bring about delay. Is there a Senator who does not rejoice that she did
                cause delay? Even if she was in the field for the simple purpose of delay, it was a
                good purpose and has brought about a most valuable end. What has Marion County
                brought you by her proposition? Instead of the little school house, Tippecanoe has
                brought you the magnificent donation of one hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
                Marion County proposed the Northwestern Christian University, and again Tippecanoe
                comes up with one hundred acres of land. Credit this to Marion County. I regret to
                see a feeling of impatience to get this matter out of the way. I maintain it is a
                most fortunate thing if it has been delayed.

              If the State University were located at the proper place my own view would be to
                connect with it this Agricultural College, but the opinion has been entertained that
                the location originally at Bloomington was a mistake, and to invest further in that
                institution would be unfortunate. I want to maintain that institution with honor and
                credit; but it seems to be conceded that this Agricultural College cannot be located
                at Bloomington. Then the question seems to be narrowed down as to whether it shall
                be located in Tippecanoe or Marion county.

              The proposition of Marion County consists of several propositions. First is the
                proportion of the Northwestern Christian University. That is a large building,
                situated at the verge of the city, a handsome building in point of architecture, and
                capable of accommodating five hundred students. There is usually about one hundred
                and fifty, leaving accommodations for three hundred and fifty more than are usually
                in attendance there. They propose to the State of Indiana this: "We will cede
                to you forever the use of the grounds-twenty-five acres-with permission to erect
                such buildings as you choose; and after erecting such buildings you shall be
                entitled to in absolute control of those buildings without interference from us." This furnishes you grounds near
                this city on which to erect buildings. There is also an additional proposition which
                is probably not entirely acceptable, but which if understood would be, it is this:
                "As we have ample room to spare, in addition we offer you the privilege to come
                in and occupy this building with us." This is no entangling alliance. The
                proposition provides that neither shall have control or supervision over the other,
                during the five years we are to occupy a portion of this building with them. We have
                the choice of entering at once into a large College building; this is an additional
                liberality and not something to depreciate the original proposition.

              We are not compelled to move in there, but they say: "Inasmuch as you are not
                provided with buildings, come in with us, and we will make this arrangement; it
                shall be under the direction of seven directors, you appointing the three and us
                three and these six the seventh." Is this not generous? They have not the
                absolute control and ownership of these buildings, and they put it in our power to
                equally control. It provides that the property shall revert to the grantor on the
                removal of the Agricultural College. This is superfluous, because the law provides
                that where a donation is for a specific purpose, the effect is it at once reverts to
                the original doner or his heirs without reservation.

              Another proposition is from the Fletcher heirs of twenty-seven acres of land
                adjoining Northwestern Christian University, or on a line within about one thousand
                feet from it. Twenty-seven acres of rich, valuable land, lying between two gravel
                roads. They have two propositions; one is: they donate these lands and the
                Agricultural College may be located there, or if the State accepts the Christian
                University proposition they will donate. As we find that donation is in addition to
                the Northwesterd Christian University. In addition have a proposition from Marion
                County to donate one hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars in bonds, payable one
                half in ten one half in twenty years. The interest on will amount to about ten
                thousand five hundred dollars per annum.

              Mr. STEIN (interposing.) How about this seventy-five thousand dollar donation? Is
                that founded upon a legitimate order of the county Commissioners?

              Mr. CAVIN. It is made and copied literally, among the abstract of propositions
                attached to the printed bill. There is no misrepresentation. It is not of record.
                This paper is not an official record, but the one hundred thousand dollars offer is
                official. But I was a little surprised at the Senator's making that point, for
                the reason that he argues the official as well as the non-official record was void.
                If the official record is void there is no difference between them. The question
                lies deeper than this. It is asked: Has this Legislature the Constitutional power to
                authorize such legislation by County Commissioners? And it is said: It falls under
                special legislation and cannot be made under the Constitution.

              The point was made that similar bonds for the payment of soldiers were held to be
                illegal, and the act of the Legislature legalizing them has been determined to be
                valid by the Supreme Court. I claim that it does not i'all under the head of
                special Legislation. This is one of the excepted cases in the Constitution, and an
                act legalizing the bonds issued by Marion county would be good. As 1 understand the
                proposition from Tippecanoe county, it is a donation amounting to fifty thousand
                dollars paid in annunl installments of ten thousand dollars for five years. That
                donation is about equal to the interest on the Marion county bonds so long as they
                are upon interest. Another proposition is that Mr. Purdue will give one hundred and
                fifty thousand dollars payable in annual installments of fifteen thousand dollars
                each.

              It seems to me to be open to the objection that you would have a building fund of
                only twenty-five thousand dollars, and I presume that fund would not be sufficient
                to commence with. It should be a considerable building and with twenty-five thousand
                dollars to expend the first year, it could not be erected at the end of the second
                year with fifty thousand dollars nor at the end of the third year with seventy-five
                thousand dollars,or the fourth, year with one hundred thousand dollars. Then how are
                buildings to be erected by means of a fund collected in this manner? It seems to me
                this is a cogent objection against this proposition.

              Another objection is that by an irrepealable law it is to be called the
                "Purdue University." That is not a handsome name to begin with. It
                don't impress me favorably any how. But there is one thing I must say: I
                don't regard this as a liberal proposition. It is simply a trade. Here is an
                old gentleman having plenty of money who proposes to indulge his vanity. It is not
                liberality or generosity. I say when it conies to a question of motive, it was not
                one of generosity. If the College is not given that name it sticks out that the
                proposition is withdrawn. If it had been simply liberality on his part he would have
                made this proposition, and allowed the State to name it after the doner if she
                would. This might have been in good taste; but to present himself here and say
                "If you will name it for me, I will present you my money, but if you don't
                I won't," is not in good taste. Then he requires that "I shall be a
                member of the Board of  Trustees and on ceasing
                to be an active member shall be an advisory member during lifetime and have
                visitorial power."

              Does this Senate propose to put this institution under the control of any man or
                body of men? Then how can you correct any mismanagement? Do you propose to part with
                the control of this institution forever? Marion County asks nothing, except that you
                locate it in our county and accept from us these donations. But we cannot tell where
                this College will be located in Tippecanoe County. The Marion County donations are
                fully equal to those of Tippecanoe; and in this place the College would be centrally
                located. That is an argument all will appreciate at once. Another is that you can
                to-morrow, if you accept of this proposition and secure your professors, you can
                enter at once the College buildings of the Northwestern Christian University
                entirely separate from their control. And the preference is that the Agricultural
                lands close by are fenced and you can enter upon them as soon as you desire to do
                so. You enter at once into possession of an Agricultural College and upon your
                grounds.

              If it is any argument that delay is best we need not enter into this Christian
                University; we can wait and erect our buildings; so we have the advantage of
                entering upon the building if we choose to or refuse if we choose to. It is another
                advantage, that in four or five years you will acquire an experience, and you will
                know what buildings you will need. Time and circumstances will develop what an
                Agricultural College will result in. While with the other propositions they commence
                building as soon as they can get the funds, with us you can begin the school in a
                large building at once. In the meantime these Trustees, appointed by the
                Legislature, will acquaint themselves with the working of Agricultural Schools. Even
                at this date we are groping in the dark. Tippecanoe owes Marion County a small debt
                of gratitude for bringing her out. 

              In order to satisfy the Senator from Parke [Mr. Rice] I will say, that the bill
                which I have presented provided that the State of Indiana never shall contribute one
                dollar for the maintainance of the College, nor be liable for one dollar of its
                liabilities. Marion County furnishes the building and the agricultural grounds, and
                the interest arising from the fund is ample to maintain the College and
                professorships for all time to come.

              When gentlemen remark that an individual would make a pet of it, and it might
                possibly be the recipient of a further donation, we have no proposition of this kind
                to make. We make this proposition because we want the College located here;because
                we are willing to pay this price to have it here.

              There has been some doubt expressed about the legality of these propositions. I
                propose to legalize them. As I have already said: we have the same guarantee of good
                faith that we have from any County or from Mr. Purdue. I have no doubt of the good
                faith of Tippecanoe County. They have said they would pay their fifty thousand
                dollars, and I have doubt they will. The Senator from Tippecanoe and other citizens
                there have guarantee its payment; and the Senator and his Count deserve a great deal
                of credit for the prominence they take in this act here; and I am sure that if the
                Senate shall decide that the proper situation from Tippecanoe County is the best for
                the State, as far as the county is concerned there is no person on the floor that
                will more heartily congratulate them than myself. But we must recollect that we are
                acting for the credit of the State; and Marion or any other county is not to be
                snubbed because she came in at a late day with an additional seventy-five thousand
                dollars. I have no doubt that Senators will be actuated only by the highest sense of
                duty.-I believe I have presented this question as fully as I care to.

              Mr. TURNER said: Mr. President: If I am not trespassing upon the courtesy due to
                the Senator from Tippecanoe, [Mr. Stein,] whose right it is I believe to open this
                subject upon his side as well as to close it, I will proceed to make a few remarks
                upon this question:

              An allusion to the motives which induced the indefinite postponement of this
                subject at the session of 1867, has been made by the Senator from Marion; and some
                explanation is due from me upon that subject. That motion having been made by me to
                indefinitely postpone, I will state that it was induced and carried by the friends
                of Marion county, and the Democrats In this Senate whose object and design was to
                defeat entirely the location at that session; hoping at a future time that they
                might have the power and might locate it. They prevented its location then for
                another purpose: it would bring a degree of patronage to the Republican party at the
                last election. I am always ready to make my motives patent under any and all
                circumstances. The question of motive then being disposed of, the Senator has
                referred to the fact that we are not discussing counties, but we are inviting
                propositions, and considering these propositions.

              As we are not discussing the merits of counties but are considering propositions
                which we have invited for the location of an Agricultural College, I shall confine
                myself to but two propositions, because I regard this question as being now reduced
                down to one; as between the two counties of Marion and Tippecanoe. And in discussing
                the question in reference to the propositions made I must say that I regard the proposition made by the Hon. John Purdue as the
                only one that has been made to this General Assembly that will hold good in law. But
                going upon the basis that the aggregate propositions from both of these counties are
                good in law and to be carried out in good faith; and, looking upon both of these
                propositions in that light, I have decided in favor of Tippecanoe County, being
                resolved that it is my duty as a representative of the people to aid as far as I can
                in the location of this Agricultural College this session. The proposition of the
                Hon. John Purdue is a proposition that does justice to the great mind, and the high
                character of that noble old roman, (as I would call him,) of Tippecanoe county.

              As far as the question of counties is concerned, I have no partialities as between
                these two counties. Neither one of them sends representative to this Legislature
                that accord with me in political opinion. There is only a joint difference in their
                history in the past, and that consists in the fact that in one of these counties
                during the last five years it was at one time impossible for those of my political
                faith to hold a political convention. I believe, in the other county that right was
                never denied them. But that is going back upon the past, and has nothing to do with
                this question now.

              The Hon John Purdue, of Lafayette, offers one hundred and fifty thousand dollars
                payable in such a manner as the State may demand, to secure the location of this
                College in his county-a munificent gift of wealth, accumulated by that man by his
                thrift and industry, which he proposes to give back to the public from which he got
                it by honesty, energy and thrift. This man of money and of I charity, throughout his
                life proposes to make himself-which I consider one of the high elements of his
                proposition-a guardian of this institution. And no man who knows the character of
                John Purdue would feel for one moment that he ever expected to charge the State of
                Indiana one cent for these services; he does it upon the ground that this
                institution is to be the pride of his life; and it is to be perhaps, his heir at the
                end of his life. And, sir, what better guarantee could we have against the filching
                of public money, or money to be disposed of for the benefit of the public at large;
                or, rather, that such a thing would not take place in the institution when this man
                who gives his money and his life to make it, his pride as a guardian of its
                interests, and who gives it these benefits that it may perpetuate his name
                hereafter? What better can we do than to let his great talents, in a financial point
                of view, guard it and conduct it, which will be sure to do, upon that system of that
                would not be practiced by any other individual in the State? It is to be his pride
                that this institution shall grow to perpetuate his name, and make it honored in
                future generations.

              But I will consider these propositions under another head, and that is: that all
                are held to be good in law and will be carried out in good faith. Then what are the
                propositions presented by Marion County? They amount to simply nothing-admitting the
                fact that they are to be carried out in good faith. The first proposition is upon
                the part of the Marion county Commissioners donating-we will take the two
                propositions together-one hundred and seventy-live thousand dollars in the bonds of
                Marion County. Now admitting that these bonds are to be issued and are good in law,
                what are they worth? They are payable twenty years after date, and will only be a
                subject for speculation upon the part of the money sharks of Marion county and the
                city of Indianapolis. These bonds could not be sold for over forty cents on the
                dollar. True they bear six per cent, interest, but money will command readily ten
                per cent. Then what does that proposition of one hundred and seventy-five thousand
                dollars amount to in cash?-and Hon. John Purdue proposes to make his proposition
                cash. It amounts to seventy thousand dollars far less than half his proposition.

              But we go farther, and there is a proposition on the part of the Fletcher to give
                twenty-seven acres of land which is represented to be worth two thousand dollars per
                acre. What does that amount to? The Agricultural College ought not to be run on less
                than one thousand acres of land, and cannot possibly be run, with the number of
                student that will be sent to it, unpon less than four hundred; and what is the
                calculation? The calculation is that Flechers, and others having land surrounding
                this tract, are to give these twenty-seven acres, in order that they may raise the
                price of their other acres to three thousand dollars an acre. If the College is
                located upon that insufficient quantity of land it amounts to the taking out of the
                Treasury of Indiana, that is to be called upon hereafter for donations to this
                Institmtion, thousands upon thousands of dollars that it may go into the pockets of
                these would be givers to the State of Indiana. For where are the four or five
                hundred acres of ground to be added in the future unless it comes out of the State
                Treasury? I regard that proposition as nothing except an incipient step to make a
                grand speculation. I have seen such speculations made-perhaps have been a party 10
                them, for I have been in a small way an humble real estate speculator in any life
                time. 1 have seen the time I would give acres to a public institution because it
                would raise my land adjoining; and  I always
                gave land upon which to build churches and school houses because it enhanced the
                value of may property adjacent. 

              Then comes another proposition from the Northwestern Christian University. And that
                proposition puts this College under sectarian influences, notwithstanding the fact
                that it is denied here. Now is a great institution like this, endowed by the General
                Government to be put under the influence of and controlled by them? But what do they
                demand? They say that it is to be under the exclusive control and management of the
                State, and afterwards they say that the grounds are to be under the control of seven
                directors, three to be elected by the Legislature or appointed by the State
                authorities, three to be elected by the Northwestern Christian University and the
                seventh is to be chosen by these six. Then if they get three and the State three and
                these six choose one I would like to knowT if they don't have three and
                one-half sevenths? And their proposition amounts to nothing-for the simple reason
                that they propose to give nohting-literally nothing except the use of their building
                for five years. And the probabilities are that under the head of charity they would
                claim a donation from the State upon the ground that they had assisted the State in
                starting this Agricultural Institution:-that they were needy and had assisted the
                State at a time when it needed assistance.

              Now, sir, I have about done; the proposition of Marion County amounts-to sum it up:
                the 175,000 dollars-if these bords should be properly and legally signed,-not more
                than a seventy thousand dollars proposition. The proposition of the Fletcher's
                amounts to the fact that they expect to take out of the State of Indiana hereafter
                five or six hundred thousand dollars for additional land to be sold by them to the
                State. But what is the necessity of running this Agricultural College upon ground
                that is worth two thousand dollars an acre, when the best land in the country
                applicable to the purpose, can be had for one hundred dollars an acre ?

              But the proposition of Hon. John Purdue is a tangible proposition. I have not
                regarded the proposition of the Methodist Episcopal Institute at the Battlegroucd-I
                have not spoken a single word about that for the simple reason that I put that
                proposition upon the same ground of that of the Northwestern Christian University.
                Unless John Purdue and the other commissioners may consent to locate this College
                there, and until it is located there, it amounts to nothing, and I shall so treat
                it-

              Mr. CHURCH (interposing,) Would it nor amount to something if we had no other
                proposition before us?

              Mr. TURNER I think the State should accept a donation from no sect, because it
                would place itself under obligations to grant to that sect whatever charities it may
                ask hereafter. Well sir, the proposition of Mr. Purdue, which I advocate is found
                fault with upond the ground that he wants his name attached to the Institution. What
                higher motive could impel any many to give away his money in great sums than that he
                should have his name attached to the institution appropriating it? Then it is
                claimed as an objection that he wants to be a Trustee throughout his life. As I
                stated before, what greater guarantee can we have for the fair and judicious
                appropriation of all the funds that may go to that Institution than that this man,
                who has proved himself to be such a great financier should have the management of
                it, when his interest for and in the perpetuity of his name has caused him to adopt
                it as his child? With these remarks I submit that I shall vote not in favor of
                Tippecanoe County but John Purdue.

              Mr. HAMILTON. Mr. President: It occurs to me that this subject has been well
                ventilated. I thought of submitting a few remarks in regard to the matter, but I
                don't know that I can bring anything new to light. I remind myself of an
                anecdote I heard about a certain chap and a cider barrel. He said there had been
                cider in it and from the way it sounded he thought there might be cider in it yet.
                So I sometimes think I have a speech to make but when I get on the floor I feel that
                I am mistaken. [Laughter.]

              I want to speak of some things alluded to by the Senator from Marion, [Mr. Cavin.]
                I have the highest respect for him as a gentleman and for his candor and fairness,
                and I am disposed to believe that in making his statements he has been candid and
                fair in all this matter. As far as the question with regard to the legality of these
                donations is concerned, I leave that for legal gentleman. In the first place let us
                look over the amounts of the donations from Marion and Tippecanoe Counties. He
                started out by specifying that the two propositions were nearly equal. I differ with
                him about one hundred thousand dollars. From Marion County I make it in round
                number? about two hundred thousand dollars, and when I take up Tippecanoe I
                don't know anything about these buildings at the Battleground I get in round
                numbers about three hundred thousand dollars. But let us look at it from the
                standpoint that the two propositions are equal as far as dollars and cents are
                concerned, and notice that Marion County is in a central position. Yet we ask the
                gentleman: What has the Northwestern Institute received? Nothing. We look at this
                city and see what has been done for it by the public money out of the people's
                pockets. Here are buildings all about it with spires pointing up to Heaven that give
                evidence of the liberality of Indiana - if
                figured up it would amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars, and it has had a
                great deal to do with bnilding up the wealth of this city. At the Wabash river we
                have an institution erected by the State, the Normal School; and between us and
                there we have the House of Refuge. Go east and there is the Soldiers' home; but
                look in the direction of Tippecanoe County. Has she not paid her part of the taxes
                to build up these magnificent buildings all around this city? An submitting this
                question in candor, - for I don't know any other way to talk except as a candid
                man, - suppose the propositions from Tippecanoe I ask Senators which should have the
                preference to-day? I ask you when you go to vote upon this bill to let this stand
                out before you.

              I want to refer to one fact in regard to this proposition of the Battleground. My
                worthy friend over there and we ought to like each other because we are both
                Kentuckians-is laboring under a mistake when he concludes there is nothing in that
                proposition. They don't propose to ask the State to give them anything for it.
                I have a little farm over in Boone, and if I would propose to give that to the
                Senator wouldn't he think it would be worth ten cents? Let us compare it with
                the I Christian University. I never will give my ' vote to locate this
                Agricultural College Fund with any religious denomination. The people I am connected
                with have two institutions and they are building another in Warren County, of which
                I am a trustee, and if you were to ask me to take it with any of these institutions
                I would not do it. This Christian University by their plan might have four of the
                Directors, for they would be just as likely to secure the seventh one as the three
                chosen by the Legislature. Do we propose to throw this Institution under the control
                of a religious denomination? sectarian, I propose to say to a great extent: for to a
                great extent we are all sectarian. I take the position that the Tippecanoe
                proposition is decidedly the best to say nothing about the buildings at the
                Battleground which amounts to one hundred thousand dollars. That would give us quite
                a start in preparing material for a magnificent building there.

              Then there is quite a difference between Marion and Tippecanoe Counties as to the
                security of the propositions coming from the County Boards;-the proposition coming
                from Tippecanoe County is vouched for by gentlemen of ability for wealth, yet the
                honorable Senator before us, [from Marion County,] could not present his in a shape
                that was legal, but relied on some future action of the Legislature to legalize it.
                I do not propose to operate in that way. I differ very much with him-they say great
                men do differ-with regard to the proposition of Mr. Purdue. He thinks it selfish.
                Let me tell you to-day I might regret if I had a mother and she was a widow that she
                could not marry Mr. Purdue, because, inasmuch as that gentleman has no children I
                would like him to be my step father so that I might receive his wealth,[Laughter.]
                He proposes to give one hundred and fifty thousand dollars and his proposition is to
                give it in ten years, but such is his interest in it, that he will pay it when it is
                needed, and in addition he proposes to give one hundred acres of land, and I
                understand that will be worth twenty thousand dollars more. Here is a gentleman
                having all the wealth necessary to live, without lacking for anything; he makes this
                donation, and because he only wants to look over this matter, he is said to be
                parsimonious and selfish. But our friend didn't tell us that this church was
                selfish because they want at least half of the control of this Agricultural
                College.

              Mr. CAVIN (interposing.) The institution does not want any control over it at
                all.

              Mr. HAMILTON. It does seem to me as though they want the control over it; but we
                will look after old Father Purdue. Can we be suspicious of an individual that has
                made such a magnanimous offer? And can we deny-that he should have some interest in
                that matter? I have a different conception of it. If some individual should propose
                to give that amount to me, and while he lived desire to control it for my benefit, I
                would say "sir, go it, because it would be safer in your hands than in
                mine."

              Look at this question candidly. I want this thing located and got out of the way.
                At the distance of my people from the two counties, I look at it as a matter of
                justice that Tippecanoe should have it. It is not going to cost a great deal to get
                there from any part of the State. And as the darkey said when asked how far it was
                from such a place? It 'pends on how you is goin' if you is goin'
                horseback 'its fifteen miles, if you is goin' to walk 'tis thirty
                miles, but if you is goin' on the iron horse you is most dar now."
                [Laughter,] I think we had better have this thing out of the way. With these remarks
                I will add nothing more.

              Mr. STEIN. Mr. President: At this late hour of the day and session I feel reluctant
                to add any thing to what has been said; yet as my silence might be reflected on in
                other quarters I cannot properly avoid, (even at the risk of indulging in a
                repetition of what I may have at one or another time already said,) to submit what
                occurs to me in relation to a comparison f the offers from Tippecanoe and Marion
                Counties. But allow me a prefatory remark or two.

              I do not desire to travel back at this stage 
                and renew the long contest had over this College question. I will simply call
                attention to the great injustice done to the people by delaying the location of the
                College. A generation of scholarship lasts no longer than about five years, and by
                our protracted wrangles in the past we have lost one class forever. It is quite
                possible that the delay, as intimated by the Senator from Marion [Mr. Cavin,]
                brought about its blessings, by giving opportunity for the more liberal
                contributions now offered. But this result was not of man's seeking-it must be
                credited to the special Providence which overruled for good the obstructions
                interposed for evil. But we can no longer trifle with the subject in a like manner.
                The necessity of locating the College now is apparent. We have but another session
                between this and the expiration of our days of grace in 1872. The experience of four
                sessions wasted in futile effort is full of admonition against further delay.
                Therefore let us not go hence without executing our duty and putting a final quietus
                upon the contentions which have heretofore beset this great trust.

              To return to the propositions now before us from Tippecanoe and Marion. They differ
                radically, as I conceive, in their character. The one comes to us in a spirit of
                unselfishness and of devotion to the sacred cause of education-unless, indeed, the
                honorable pride of a name be deemed a blameable selfishness. Can we say the like of
                the offer from Marion County? Let us investigate it; let us examine its underlying
                purposes; let us test its guarantees. I fear we have been deceived by pretentious
                and appearances. It behoves us in the settlement of this great benefaction of the
                General Government to walk by a sure path and on safe ground. We cannot fly off at
                hap hazard in the wake of a delusive will-o-the-wisp. We should be well assured that
                the considerations tendered as the price of location will stand fire in the courts
                of law and can be enforced.

              The offer from Marion County, as a County, is one of money. In aid of this certain
                individuals, and more particularly a sectarian corporation, to which I shall again
                refer, offers grounds and buildings. The first in order is the County offer. It
                stands before us in two sections. The first covers an installment of one hundred
                thousand dollars and has been before us since the last session; the second came a
                few days ago and pretends to be an offer of seventy-five thousand dollars.

              Now I may observe once again, what I have urged before, that all appropriations by
                County Boards to this object lack a reliable basis of legitimacy. They are open to
                the warfare of dissatisfied tax payers, who by the process of injunction may haply
                in a day dissipate the flourishing subsidies now tendered to us. It will require
                enabling legislation to valid such tenders and even then the question remains
                debateable on Constitutional grounds. But I merely recall this objection by way of
                suggestion. I do not insist upon it for the for the present as against the one
                hundred thousand dollar offer of Marion. I believe this offer is duly supported by
                the official action of the County Board.

              But as regards the second offer-that of seventy-five thousand dollars. I am
                surprised that more indignation was not manifested on this floor at the shape in
                which it came to us. It is a communication to the Governor signed by three who
                describe themselves as Commissioners of Marion County, asking him to apprise the
                General Assembly that they will appropriate seventy-five thousand dollars &c.
                When it was read in this chamber, in the haste of the occasion we were all misled
                into the notion that it was an official appropriation, already duly made by the
                Board, But what is the fact? The Senator from Marion County admits on this floor
                that there never was such an order made. I charge here that I personally have had
                the records of the Commissionees' Court examined and that no such order can be
                found in them. This offer can have been pushed hither for no other purpose than to
                hoodwink and deceive us. I cast no imputation upon the Senator from Marion, who has
                my unbounded respect and esteem and who is a man of honor. The offer came to us
                through another channel-through a message from the Governor; who, also is not to
                blame, as he could do nothing but lay before us the paper which had been
                communicated to him, and with the origin and purposes of which he had no connection.
                But of the offer itself, as it is now clearly understood, I can only say that it
                deserves to be spurned from this chamber as spurious and calculated to delude. As an
                inducement for the location of the College in this city it is a snare and should be
                shunned and repudiated accordingly.

              Then what have we from Marion county? One hundred and seventy-five thousand
                dollars; seventy-five thousand of which is a myth and a vanity. And how is this sum
                secured? By six per cent Connty bonds payable in ten and twenty years. And these are
                to form the building fund. We have nothing else to re* sort to for the erection of
                the necessary buildings. We cannot encroach upon the scrip fund. The act of Congress
                forbids that. Then what shall we value these County bonds as a present building
                fund? What per centage would they bring in the money market; running on such a time
                and with the risk of being stopped by the action of any discontented tax-payer? Ask
                the business men of this city. Would they fetch fifty per cent? I have been
                collecting some opinions from judicious and reliable  and find that the common judgment runs from twenty to
                forty per cent. By the time we have suffered this shave what becomes of your one
                hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars? We would find that these bonds are but
                part of a money scheme, hatched for speculation and ultimately inuring to the
                benefit of sharpers more interested in the discount than the College.

              But I fancy I hear the Senator from Marion saying: "We bring you the
                Northwestern Christian University." True; and I look upon the offer from that
                Institution as even more obnoxious than that from the County. It comes to us covered
                and manacled with conditions all looking to the ultimate absorption of the
                Agriculture College and its government. The offer from the Fletcher heirs is simply
                in aid of the Northwestern Christian University. The two are together in the same
                bed. We sre told that we may be fellow lodgers with our College in the University
                for five years, provided, we in the mean while, work up a ouilding for ourselves on
                their grounds, and, when our term is out, quit and betake ourselves to our own
                roost. We must keep ourselves caged however on their campus-a patch of some
                twenty-five acres. They retain the title but for the sake of our company they fill
                give us an undivided half interest. One thing, however, they do not give us;
                complete control and government. Three of the seven directors shall be of their
                choosing and the seventh shall be chosen by the preceeding six. Thus they have half
                the government, and BOW long, in this city-where the Legislature sits handy and
                accessible to the continual pressure of the most interested party-how long I ask
                will it be before the Northwestern Christian University owns the whole College and
                its government?

              Sir, I protest against putting this magnificent grant under sectarian influences. I
                share the sentiments of the Senator from Clinton [Mr. Hamilton,] on this subject,
                and trust the Legislature will be slow in lending ear to solicitations which strike
                at our sovereignty and the character of the Institution we are called upon to
                originate.

              But consider the offers from my own County-Tippecanoe. We ask no subtraction of the
                severeignty of the State. We leave the government of the College and the scheme of
                education where it now resides-with the Legislature. As to our main offer it asks no
                conditions except such as the State can readily grant without a deduction of its own
                powers and supervision in all essential matters. It is the honor of a name in behalf
                of the munificent donor. I am surprised to find this mature of the offer the subject
                of censorious sm on this floor. It has been stigma-as selfish vanity for Mr, Purdue
                to ask that the Institution be named the "Purdue University."

              Sir, it strikes me as a vanity worthy of all honor and imitation. It is the vanity
                of all the genuine philanthropists of our race. It is the honorable and praiseworthy
                vanity which associates itself with the sacred cause of education and public morals.
                We can look with contempt upon the selfish vanity of the Egyptian monarch who sought
                his immortality in the everlasting worthless pyramid, but he who seeks his fame in
                the advancement of his fellow man-in the dedication of his fortune and his efforts
                to mental enlightement and public virtue appeals to every sentiment of admiration
                and respect which can animate the human mind. To call this a selfish vanity is to
                misname things. May the kind Providence who has ever kept the destinies of our
                Commonwealth in friendly keeping, (shower down such selfish vanity bountifully upon
                our people.

              As a legislator I shall always be delighted to assist and encourage it. And let me
                say in reference to this question of a corperate name-"Purdue
                University"-it is but a small return, and one which costs the State nothing,
                for the splendid donation he offers. I would deem it a wanton indignity to the
                liberal spirit in which he stands before us to deny him this distinction-or to
                couple it with qualifying words. What I said to the Committee which had this bill
                under consideration I say here; that I consider this name as a most harmless and
                reasonable demand on the part of Mr. Purdue, and that I cannot consent to have a,
                syllable or a letter added thereto or taken therefrom-and that rather than see it
                done I should feel myself, with all due respect to my colleagues on this floor,
                compelled to retire from the field with all his offers and leave the competition to
                other quarters. I say this on my own motion and not under instructions from, Mr.
                Purdue.

              But, I may be told, Mr. Purdue makes further stipulations. True; but they are all
                for the benefit of the Institution, and with a view to its entire success. He asks
                to be added to the present Board of Trustees in order to have a voice in the
                selection of the precise point in Tippecanoe County at which the College is to be
                located. Is this unreasonable? We have auxiliary offers from two localities in our
                county. One from the old Battleground-the veteran applicant of many years for this
                institution-the other from Mr. Meharry of Shawnee Mound.

              Who is better qualified to assist us this matter of location than one of our most
                intelligent citizens-familiar with our people and our localities for over thirty
                years? He also asks that should he during his life time, cease to be trustee, he may
                be retained as an advisory member of the Board.
                This confers no power and is for the advantage of the great trust. He also asks
                visitorial power; but of a limited kind. A general power of visitation would, I
                grant, on common law principles include the a right of dictating a scheme of
                education-but this he disclaims; and hence his visitorial power is expressly limited
                by the letter of the bill. He "shall have visitorial power for "the
                purpose of Inspecting the property, real and personal, of said University;
                recommending to the Trustees such measures as he may deem necessary for the good of
                the University and investigating the financial concerns of the corporation."
                These are the limits of his power and they are asked, to use his own words to
                me-"to see that no one steals or mismanages the funds." A better party to
                exercise such powers you could not find if you ransacked the State from centre to
                circumference. These are the conditions, and the only conditions which qualify the
                cash offer of Mr. Purdue. But he guarantees in addition one hundred acres of land,
                suitable and appurtenant to the University. As I understand his mind he inclines in
                favor of a location adjacent to Lafayette. If so, the land cannot be worth less than
                one hundred dollars, and may be as much as five hundred dollars an acre. This he
                guarantees. Here then you have the land and a building fund of two hundred thousand
                dollars for let it not be forgotten that Tippecanoe as a county by its Commissioners
                has tendered fifty thousand dollars and that the order of the Commisioners is
                guaranteed in writing by responsible parties in Lafayette.

              Under the supervision of such a manager as Mr. Purdue you can with one hundred
                thousand dollars or one hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars put up such
                structures on the selected site as will be the pride of every citizen of Indiana.
                Then add what is left over-say one hundred thousand dollars, to the Congressional
                fund and you have an endowment of about three hundred and fifty thousand dollars to
                begin with-yielding a yearly revenue of from twenty to twenty-five thousand
                dollars-sufficient to equip the professorships with the finest talent of either
                hemisphere. Behold then the proud and solid foundation which invites your favor. It
                rests secure in private and local enterprise and casts no menacing side-glace at the
                Treasury of the State.

              I finish, Mr. President, my comparison of the offers from Marion and Tippecanoe. I
                will avoid unnecessary prolixity. I am well persuaded that the minds of Senators
                under the discussions which have been had are measureably settled on this subject.
                Time is wearing. We have a great deal of other important legislation on our hands,
                and therefore, if I am not infringing on the desire f others to be heard, I now move
                the previous question.

              Mr. HANNA. Will the Senator withdraw that motion for a moment?

              Mr. STEIN. Certainly.

              Mr. HANNA. Mr. President: It is Well, known by Senators here that I advocate the
                location of the Agricultural College at the State University. There is a spirit of
                restlessness exhibited here that shows that the Senate intends to locate it
                somewhere this session, as far as the action of the Senate is concerned There is now
                but two alternatives presented to my mind: one is the location in Tippecanoe County
                and the other in Marion County. Now if we are called upon to decide as between these
                two; for it follows that it is limited to these two, the proposition I offered
                having been voted down;-if we have to be limited to these two, then every Senator
                has to take his stand. I do not want to go back and discuss the question of the
                first donation of these lands It was of that vast system of stealing the public
                lands which has been going on for the last few years. It has been an expense to the
                State of Indiana from the time we took charge of it; and I myself, am willing to
                agree that we should get rid of it by indefinitely postponing or locating it. We are
                consuming too much time of the people in talking about it.

              It is not necessary to rehearse the offers made by Tippecanoe County. The offer as
                made by the County itself, and the offer of the County of Marion as made by the
                County itself, I do not regard as of any availability at all. It is true we might
                proceed to compel a compliance with the conditions but how can we bind the tax
                payers, when they have a Constitutional right to interpose and prevent the payment
                of those bonds?

              The other day the Supreme Court decided that the Board of Commissioners of Putnam
                County had no right to take money out of the Treasury and pay for a poor farm,
                because they possessed a piece of land they held for that purpose. Why did they
                decide so? Upon the principle that the Board of Commissioners were trifling with
                limited powers; and powers defined by the law which created the institution itself.
                There is no power to enforce a tax upon me for building up an Agricultural College.
                Then I regard these proposition as amounting to nothing.

              The question is are we willing to locate this College upon the proposition on the
                part of an individual? If so I take my stand upon the proposition of the individual
                who I understand is able to meet his contracts. If he is able to meet his contracts
                it is that much towards the erection of that institution; and if the Senate is bound
                to locate this Agricultural College at this session, I do not see how we can do
                  otherwise.

              For myself I would vote for Tippecanoe County in preference to voting for
                Indianapolis, if there was not a dollar offered by Tippecanoe County. I never would
                give my vote for the education of children in Marion County since I stood in that
                room and saw her citizens chuckling while a military officer was training his cannon
                upon a Democratic meeting in this city. I am controled by poor frail human nature.
                If a man strikes me he must expect to be stricken back if it is twenty years
                afterward. Marion County can get no vote from me to educate children in her midst at
                the expense of the public Treasury. If driven to choose between these two
                propositions I shall vote for Tippecanoe as between the two.

              Mr. STEIN. I now renew my motion for the previous question.

              The demand for the previous question was seconded by the Senate.

              The main question being shall the bill pass? a constitutional provision requiring
                the yeas and nays, they were ordered and being taken resulted-yeas 32, nays 10-as
                follows:

              Pending the roll call-

              Mr. BELLAMY, in explanation of his vote when his name was called, was understood to
                lay that there had been no fair chance to offer substitutes for the bill; and to
                object to rushing so important a matter through under the operation of the previous
                question; consequently he voted no.

              Mr. RICE, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote said: Having decided
                this question fairly before this Senate against the location of the Agricultural
                College at Bloomington, in defiance of what I believed was right and for the best
                interests of the State; and being driven to a proposition to run this State in debt
                again, as between Marion County and Tippecanoe, to build up an institution of
                learning in this State, I shall give my preference for the County of Tippecanoe. I
                vote "aye."

              The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR Announced the vote-yeas 32, nays 10-as above recorded.

              So the bill passed.

            
            

          
          

          
            HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
            THURSDAY, May 6, 1869.

             On motion of Mr. BRECKINRIDGE the House now took up the special order for this
              hour-10 o'clock a. m.-viz.: the bill [S.
                156] accepting certain donations from Tippecanoe county, and others, and
              locating the Agricultural College, contemplated by the act of Congress approved July
              2, 1862, and providing for the organization and management thereof.

            Mr. BUSKIRK stated that having done what he might for the location of this College
              with the Indiana University at Bloomington he would withdraw further opposition to
              this bill.

            The bill [S. 156] was then passed the final
              reading in the House, without amendment yeas 76, nays 19 as follows:

              VOLUME ELEVENTH.
             The State Prisons----Their Government and Discipline.
            IN SENATE.
            
               FRIDAY, April, 30, 1869.
            
            [IN CONTINUATION-p. 135.]

             The PRESIDENT pro tem. (Hon John K.
              Cravens) announced the special order for this hour (10 o'clock a. m.) being Mr.
              Kinley's bill [S. 120.] "to provide for the government and discipline of the
              State Prisons, for the oversight of County Jails, and to repeal all other laws or
              parts of laws inconsistent herewith."-

            Mr. ROBINSON, of Decatur, moved to strike out the first section of the bill after the
              enacting clause.

            Mr. KINLEY said:

            Mr. President: The importance of this Bill will be conceeded. It proposes a radical
              change in the administration of the affairs of the State Prisons, and in the
              government and discipline of the convicts. Its changes in the administration are on
              the side of economy; in government, on the side of humanity; and in discipline on the
              side of moral reform. For all of these, it challenges the attention of the Senate.

            Before entering into the discussion of the main features of the Bill, I desire to
              allude to a few colateral matters. These being somewhat personal to myself, I shall
              speak to them as a question of privilege.

            The Bill had not been three days before the Senate when an enemy to prison reform and
              understood to be one of the directors of the State Prison south, rushed into print,
              denouncing the Bill and its friends-the first as being unconstitutional, and the
              others as impracticables and visionaries.

            The author of that article has since had occasion to appear in print; not as then the
              advocate of existing corruption, but with the rage of a tried and convicted
              malefactor: and by his own showing, so infamous, that he may never again find a
              respectable newspaper through which to malign others or defend himself.

            I should not thus allude to this gentleman but for the fact that since the
              introduction of this Bill into the Senate, he has labored assiduously and insiduously
              to defeat it before the General Assembly. He has met the members in the loby, on the
              street, in the cars, at their boarding houses. He has misrepresented the Bill and the
              motives of the Senator who introduced it seeking to bring the one into disrepute and
              to destroy the influence of the other.

            I have been represented as being personally hostile to Mr. Meredith. And from this
              accusation a pretext has been raised to denounce my motives as sinister and my labors
              in the matter of prison reform as inspired by a desire to legislate Meredith out of a
              lucrative office.

            I am accused of having sought to be placed on the prison Committee. Of unfairness in
              the examination of witnesses, and of a disposition to persecute Meredith and other
              parties implicated.

            It is probable that a mere statement of these accusations is a sufficient refutation.
              It is hardly necessary to defend myself against such charges.

            These gentlemen seem to understand enough of warfare to appreciate the advantage of
              the defensive, but not enough of dialectics to know that falsehood is the flimsiest of
              all arguments, and when refuted the most dangerous to the cause of him who uses
              it.

            These charges are all and singly false. I had no hostile feelings toward Mr. Meredith
              It is true he had been brought up in my county
              and his reputation over there is not very good. Some very ugly stories are told about
              him, and I believed enough of them two years ago to withhold from him my vote in the
              nominating caucus. But I never had any personal difficulty with him. I never had any
              business with him of any kind. Neither did I use his bad reputation against him to
              defeat this nomination. It simply controlled my own vote. I believe that criminals may
              reform, and I know not what effect five or six years might have had.

            The whole charge of personal hostility has been incubated from a serpent's egg
              to meet this particular case.

            So far from desiring to disgrace legislation to gratify personal malice, it was my
              chief motive in being a candidate two years ago, to effect a reform in our Prison
              system. Mr. Meridith was not then a candidate for Prison director and I had no
              knowledge that he intended to be.

            Mr. President: I take no pleasure in uncovering other people's iniquities. I do
              not delight in the discovery of depravity. There has not been a time since this
              investigation began that I should not have delighted to know that all the parties
              implicated are innocent of the charges of which they had been accused. I should this
              moment clap my hands with joy to know that where so much depravity was supposed to
              exist-so much of moral corruption and rottenness-there is in fact only purity and
              honor.

            A Senator who could by any possibility be controlled by such ignoble motives-who
              could so subordinate the high objects of legislation into mere instruments of private
              revenue and personal hate, is unfit to transact legislative business, ought to be
              expelled from the Senate and ostracised from the face of all honorable men.

            It is false also that I sought to be placed on the Prison
                Committee. But with my opinions and motives on the subject of Prison
              reform there could have been no particular sin in doing so, I suppose it is not
              uncommon for members of legislative bodies to seek places on committees or even aspire
              to chairmanships. But that I did not seek a place on this or any other Committee the
              President of the Senate can attest. Shortly after the committees had been made up, one
              of the friends of Prison reform expressed to me regret that I had not been placed on
              the Prison Committee. I answered that I also regretted it as I felt
              particular interest in the subject, but that I had had nothing to do with the making
              up of the Committees. When the Senate next met, some Senator-the Senator from Marion,
              I believe, moved that the Senator from Wayne be added to the Prison
                Committee. This is all my knowledge on the subject

            The charge of unfairness and partiality in the investigation is equally without
              foundation.

            Why is it Mr. President, that I should be singled out as the special object of all
              these maledictions? Why should I be made the head and front of all this offending? Two
              other Senators-prominent members of this body-were also on the investigating
              committee; and no question was asked, no conclusion arrived at, no report made no
              action had, that was not the concurrent work of the whole committee; and which did not
              also meet the endorsement of the corresponding committee on the part of the House.

            Very clearly the object of these maligners is not so much to attack me personally, as
              to defeat the Bill I had the honor to introduce. It is sought by its interested and
              cunning enemies to destroy its reputation in the General Assembly by misrepresenting
              the actions and impugning the motives of its friends. I having been guilty of the
              unpardonable sin of introducing it in the Senate, am made the special target through
              which the Bill is to be struck to death. This is dishonorable warfare. It is mean
              opposition.

            My whole course on this subject gives the lie to all these accusations. I did not go
              with the Prison Committee on its first visit to the State Prison south, although I had
              long ago heard some very damaging statements in regard to its management. The
              Committee returned after having gathered up a number of facts derogatory to Meredith,
              Ghee and others. After they had returned, a sworn statement was forwarded by the
              former warden detailing a corrupt state of things.

            Under such circumstances, it was clearly the duty of the Committee to make a report.
              They certainly would have reported; and with the facts before them their report must
              have been very damaging to the parties implicated.

            But the testimony had been all from one side. The evidence was all ex parte. I
              believe that the party accused had a right to face its accusers, cross examine the
              witnesses and if necessary bring in rebutting testimony. It was for these reasons as I
              stated at the time, that I moved the appointment of a sub-committee of investigation
              with power to send for persons and papers. If these parties have been innocent a
              committee of investigation is precisely what they should have asked; and they would
              have thanked instead of maligning me for having moved in the matter. If they had been
              innocent their innocence should have been known and public confidence in them
              restored. If guilty should be known and they removed from a place they had
              dishonored.

            In moving a Committee of investigation, I did for them precisely what an honorable
                 man stinging under the sense of public
              reproach, would have demanded. No man who has a particle of manhood; no man possessing
              the slightest sense of honor but would have been restive under such charges of
              corruption This baby cry of persecution against a Committee that reports only facts,
              is at once an acknowledgment of guilt and a blatant publication of their own
              dishonor.

            The two Committees-the Committee from the Senate and the Committee from the
              House-formed one joint Committee of investigation They acted harmoniously; they did
              their work in good faith; treated all parties honestly, fairly, candidly; and the
              result of their work is before the Senate.

            So far from having done the parties injustice, the Committee returned-every member of
              it I believe-profoundly convinced that the great mass of this disgusting corruption
              had been only touched-that what was discovered wat not a moiety of what was
              concealed.

            If any one has any doubt of this let him move a new Committee. Let it be composed of
              the especial friends of Meredith and Ghee. Give it power to send for persons and
              papers, with a weeks time to investigate, and they will come to you with a report by
              the side of which ours will be innocence itself. Swear all the guards Let the poor
              female convicts testily, and you shall have tales of wrong, and outrage, and bestial
              libidinousness compared with which thieves are respectable, and brothels houses places
              of virtue.

            But quite enough has been reported for the credit of the State, enough to justify
              extreme measures on the part of the General Assembly. The testimony shows that
              officers and employees had been guilty of drunkenness and (debauchery with the female
              convicts-that two of the directors had received regular gratiuties from the Warden,
              and the Warden in turn from those beneath him as the price of their places. That one
              of the directors boasted that it was his object to make money out of the institution.
              That another director accepted a bribe from a convict to obtain his release, and with
              a part of his pay in his pocket, went to the Governor with an ingenious falsehood to
              influence a pardon; and finally in order to cover up his iniquity was guilty of direct
              and positive purjury before the investigating Committee.

            A noticeable circumstance has been the aggregation of interests and influences
              brought to bear against this Bill. It is not corruption in the State Prison alone,
              with which the Prison reform has to contend. The rogue who steals in any one
              department is the natural friend and ally of him who steals in any other.

            "A fellow feeling makes wondrous kind."

            A common danger of detection and punishment, confederates rogues into rings of
              offensive and defensive.

            It is said to be a curious fact in natural history that snakes of every description,
              kind and species, when they go into winter quarters wind and tie themselves into one
              general knot If you but touch the smallest of them, every mouth opens, and hisses, and
              spits its venom.

            So it is with corruption. It forms rings and whoever has the limerity to touch the
              least one tn the combination, has the whole infernal confederacy to fight.

            Timid persons may shrink from duty-cowards may flee from danger-corrupt men may form
              a serried phalanx around moral rottenness-there will yet be found those who have the
              nerve to do their duty-the courage to lace danger-and who have higher motives than,
              the rewards which corruption may offer.

            Mr. President: I should not have alluded to the results of the investigation by the
              Committee but for the singular course of the opposition to this Bill outside of this
              chamber. But I do not complain of their course. I am compelled to admit that they have
              been consistent. There is a logical connection between the villains who perpetrated
              the enormities of the southern Prison and the system itself. The corruption and
              bestial indecencies testified to before the Committee must be disproved in fact or the
              system under which such irregularities are possible must be condemned, the enemies of
              Prison reform see this and hence their defence of Ghee and Meredith-hence their
              attempt to falsify the facts in the Prison report, and their mean insinuations against
              the honor and integrity of the Committee. We accept the issue and plead the testimony
              now before the Senate in justification of our report. No candid person can read the
              testimony without arriving at the conclusion that some of the Prison directors ought
              themselves to take places along side of the convicts. Not a convict in all the
              Penitentiary can be lower than the man whether officer or guard who was sailed in
              nightly debauch with the female convicts. Not a burglar or robber in the Prison more
              deserving his place than is the Prison director of a like condemnation who proposes
              for a bribe to turn loose unreformed, unrepentant burglars on society. We propose you
              a remedy. We propose a Bill which repeals the law by which the directors were
              appointed. We propose to turn the river into this augean stable.

            Let us examine this Bill. Let us consider this remedy. It is not pretended to be
              faultless. Reasonable objections doubtless may be raised. I could, I think, improve it
              in many essential respects. But it is a great improvement on the present system. The
              change is in the right direction and it goes as far perhaps, as is safe at the
              present. Impatient persons would move faster. He
              who sees, or thinks he sees, the value of a proposed reform, would leap at
              conclusions, and wonders that others hesitate. He who has given his thoughts to a
              subject until he has mapped out in his mind all its bearings, relations and
              tendencies, grows impatient of hesitation and would realize results. But it is wise to
              move slowly; and the more radscal the reform the greater should be the caution in its
              adoption.

            We are not ready to say so now but the time will no doubt come, when the
              convicts' road to freedom, after having served out a prescribed time, will be
              through manifest reformation. When crime will be treated as the result of moral
              insanity, and penitentiaries only as hospitals for their cure.

            Mankind will doubtless sometime recognize the great truth, that man in every stage of
              his existence is the outgrowth of pre-existing causes, and the moral reformer will
              labor to elevate the race through the influencing conditions.

            The Bill before the Senate recoganizes this principle but does not carry it to the
              full extent of its logical conclusions. It is safe to travel in roads which experience
              has demonstrated to be practical. Beyond the teachings of experience we have not
              presumed to go.

            The difference between the Bill before the Senate and the present system is mainly in
              the animating spirit. While it retains the idea of punishment as a terror to evil
              doers, the reformation of the criminal himself is its most salient feature. It
              provides therefore for the instruction-intellectual, moral and religious of the
              convicts; and requires the Moral Instructor to give to the convicts, his whole time
              and attention.

            But before discussing the merits of the Bill itself, it is better to consider and if
              possible to answer the objections to it. These being removed we shall be able to see
              its provisions in a better and clearer light.

            It is to be regretted, however, that the opponents to Prison reform should not have
              confined themselves to arguments against the proposed reformation itself, and not
              trusted their cause to maledictions against its friends. 

            The first objection urged was its unconstitutionality. This indictment contained two
              counts.

            1st. The Bill as originally introduced provides that the Prison Board should
              severally retain their offices for ten years, whereas the constitution provides that
              in offices created by the General Assembly the terms of office shall not exceed four
              years.

            This objection, if a valid one has been obviated by the amendments to the Bill in
              Committee to conform to the constitution.

            It is true the question might have been raised whether a member of a Board with only
              a nominal salary to defray expenses, is an office in the constitutional meaning of the
              word. The members of the Board for the House of Refuge hold their offices for a term
              of six years; and if the objection to this is valid, it must apply with equal force
              against the law organizing that institution.

            The Bill organizing the House of Refuge was introduced, I believe, and certainly
              defended by the able Senator from Laporte, Judge Niles, himself a member of the
              Constitution Convention and a lawyer of the very first legal abilities.

            The second objection dignified into a constitutional one, lies in the fact that it
              repeals the law arganizing the present Prison system, and thereby legislating the
              acting Prison directors out of office. Those who urge this objection, hold that an
              office is of the nature of a contract; and that a person having once accepted an
              office, the office belongs to him of right until the expiration of the term for which
              he has been elected or appointed. The Constitution of the United States and the
              Constitution of this State prohibit the General Assembly from passing any law
              impairing the obligation of contracts. It is held that the election to and acceptance
              of an office constitutes a contract carrying with it certain vested rights.

            I do not know that this argument Is worth an answer; but since it is urged and relied
              upon to defeat this Bill, I may be pardoned for giving it a little attention.

            I admit that an office is something of the nature of a contract; and that on the
              acceptance of an office with the discharge of its duties, certain rights rests.

            But, allowing it to be a contract, it is a contract, it is a contract with
              conditions. One of these conditions is the reserved right of the General Assembly to
              alter, amend or repeal any law of its own enacting. This condition enters into and is
              a part of the contract. With a full knowledge of the existence of this reserved right
              in behalf of the State, the office is accepted. It very clearly follows that the
              repeal of a law creating an office is no violation of the contract-is no bad faith to
              the office holder. It is but the happening of a contingency, subject to which the
              office has been accepted.

            In the State Constitutional Convention a precisely analagous question was raised.
              Under the old Constitution certain County officers held their place for seven years,
              and certain, judicial officers during good behaviour. Although these had been elected
              and qualified, and were serving in good faith in their respective offices, the
              Convention did not hesitate to cut short their terms of service regardless of any
              supposed vested rights. It is true were Constitutional offices. But the cases are  analagous, and the same principle applies. They
              had been created by one Constitutional Convention and a subsequent Constitutional
              Convention nullified a part of the term of service. On the same principle a Prison
              director created by one General Assembly may be abolished by another. In a case where
              the necessity of change is so manifest, I hope this General Assembly will not hesitate
              to follow so distinguished a precedent.

            Precisely in the proportion that the Constitution has the character of fixedness and
              permanency is the force of the precedent increased. While the action of the General
              Assembly might not be authority for a Constitutional Convention, a Constitutional
              Convention is authority for a General Assembly. If under the remote possibility of a
              change, the acceptance of an office is conditional, much more is the acceptance of it
              conditional under the more mutable laws of the General Assembly.

            Again, on this theory of vested fights, the General Assembly would have no power to
              increase the duties, or diminish the salary or perquisites of an officer without his
              consent. For the salary is a part of the contract, and I presume with these political
              curmudgeons the chief part. They might not object to having their salaries
              increased.

            If offices vest rights as against the State, they should also vest in behalf of the
              State. I hardly think however, it will ever be doubted by this Senate, that officers
              may sometimes resign, regardless of all vested rights that the State may have in their
              services.

            It is a safe rule that no rights vest against the public good. The power of the
              General Assembly to alter, amend or abolish any law of its own enacting is
              unquestionable. I have heard no further objections to this Bill. It is not denied, I
              believe, that the proposed system is more economical, will be better for the convicts
              and will be batter for the State.

            In the place of a system which has cost the State Treasury an annual appropriation of
              many thousand dollars, and which has culminated in the most loathsome corruption, we
              offer a system that will be likely to secure good men in office, and instead of being
              an annual drawing on the Treasury may be made at least self-supporting. What is of
              vastly more consequence to the State and to humanity at large, instead of degrading
              the convicts into deeper vice, proposes a reasonable hope for their elevation-one
              which experience in other places has demonstrated will so far reform a large
              proportion of the convicts as to fit them to take their places in society as
              citizens.

            It differs from the present system in the method of appointment of the Prison Board.
              Under the proposed law, the members of the Board will be appointed by tho Governor by
              and with the advice and consent of the Senate.

            Under the present system, it is patent every Senator that Prison directors are select
              ed with little reference to qualification. Long previous to the meeting of the General
              Assembly, it is true, we receive letters and recommendations from citizens of various
              parts of the State, notifying us that they will be candidates for office before the
              ensuing session of the General Assembly. But we have little or no opportunities to
              know any thing about the standing or fitness of the candidates. The reasons usually
              assigned do not imply that the applicants regard qualification as an inducement for a
              vote. We are generally told in these letters of application that the writer has served
              the party, has perhaps been unfortunate in an election and asks the dominant party to
              reward him with a rich office.

            Two years ago Mr. Meredith came with just such a tale of sorrow on his lips. He had
              been defeated in a race for the Clerk's office of his county, and we were asked
              to reverse the decision of the people and give him a sinecure. Whoever received a
              letter from an applicant for Prison director stating as a reason for his application
              any interest he had in the Prison or its inmates?

            When the General Assembly meets the dominant party must be carried. A caucus
              nomination must be received. A majority of the dominant party must be secured. This,
              no one of the many applicants is able to obtain. Combination arise. Kings are formed.
              A sufficient number combine to control a majority of the caucus. Every session of the
              General Assembly witnesses the buying and selling of the votes of members like stock
              in the market. And thus it is that men without honor, honesty or character work
              themselves into lucrative offices.

            This Bill provides the appointment of the Board of Prison directors by the Governor,
              by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. He has the whole State to select
              from. He has opportunity to look into the character of his appointees; and finally his
              appointees are passed on by the Senate.

            Another feature of the present Bill is the merely nominal salaries of the members of
              the Prison Board. The office of Director under the present system is a sinecure. In
              the southern State Prison; even if the directors had been honest and received only
              what the law allots, the pay is eight hundred dollars a year for only a trifling
              amount of time and labor. In the northern State Prison the pay is still greater for
              the same service. The law allows them three dollars a day. This is construed to mean
              every day of the year whether any service is rendered or not, giving the directors
              over a thousand dollars annually. An annual salary  of eight hundred or a thousand dollars without any adequate services rendered is in
              itself a strong inducement for unworthy persons to geek the position. When you add an
              opportunity for an indefinite amount of stealage it is not strange that such public
              plunderers as Meredith and Ghee should occasionally find places on the Prison Board.
              It is not strange that an unmanageable director should be bought off with a sum more
              than double his honest salary for his own term of office.

            The single fact that the corruption and crime developed by the Prison Committee are a
              possibility, condemns the system and demands reform.

            A salient feature in the proposed system is its economy. The annual salaries of the
              directors of the northern Prison amount to three thousand two hundred and eighty-five
              dollars. Those of the southern Prison amount to two thousand four hundred dollars,
              making a total of five thousand six hundred and eighty-five dollars against one
              thousand five hundred under the proposed system. And yet while a salary of five
              hundred dollars a year will not be an inducement for dishonest persons to seek the
              position, it is a sunicientpay/or the service actually rendered.

            Another feature of the proposed Bill, which will commend itself to the judgment of
              the Senate, is the consolidation of the two Prisons into one general system, having
              the same Board of Commissioners for both. This gives unity to the system and enables
              both to work to the same end.

            The Board of Commissioners will be composed of men eminently qualified for their
              position. They will have been selected on account of their interest in Prison reform;
              on account of their sympathy for the fallen; on account of their enlightened opinions
              on the subject of Prison discipline; and Prison management; and their characters would
              be a pledge for an honest and economical administration of Prison affairs. You should
              not expect, under their administration that five thousand dollars could be paid to get
              rid of an unmanageable director. You should not expect officers and guards to hold
              carnival and debauch with female convicts; or to have to have to pay subsidies for the
              privilege of holding their places. Above all, you should not expect a director to
              accept a bribe for securing a pardon for an unreformed and unrepentent convict, for
              turning loose on society the very class of persons for the confinement of whom
              penitentiaries have been established.

            The whole Prison corps, from guard to commissioner would be conposed of persons of
              integrity, and honor who would deal justly and humanely with the persons under their
              charge and honestly with the interests of the State. Th system of stealage would be
              abolished. As an economical measure, the amount saved to the State from this source
              alone will go far towards meeting the annual appropriations.

            Another source of economy which should not be left out of the account will arise from
              the reformation effected among the convicts themselves. This will be felt in many ways
              beneficial to the State finances. It will enable the managers to diminish the number
              of guards. The humane treatment by the present Warden even during the short time which
              he has held his place, has greatly decreased the discontent of the convicts.

            The reformation which will be effected will increase the number of trusty convicts,
              and render it practicable to employ a greater force of convict labor outside the
              prison walls. Grounds enough can thus be cultivated by the convicts themselves to
              supply the Prison with vegetables, adding at once to the economy and the health of the
              institution.

            Another and the great source of economy to the State will arise from the reformatory
              effect of the Prison as a means of preventing crime. A large proportion of the
              released convicts will be reformed and perhaps all of them returned to society better
              men than when they left it, certainly none of them worse. These will be ready to
              become useful in productive industry. It will thus diminish the amount of crime
              committed; diminish the number of criminal cases to be tried in the Courts, diminish
              the number of convicts convicted, and increase proportionately the security of public
              and private property.

            The hands of desperadoes and outlaws who make day and night hideous with their
              crimes, have their ranks daily recruited from the released convicts of the
              penitentiary, and this by men graduated in crime and rendered desperate by the loss of
              all hope and all self-respect.

            Under the present system it is only occasionally that a convict is reformed. There
              are no means, no appliances to reach the moral nature, and wake up the slumbering
              conscience. Some Prison directors have boldly avowed that there is no hope for the
              reformation of the convict. And while every man connected with the Prison, is there
              simply for the salary, with the superadded stealage, or as a speculator out of the
              Prison labor, it is to be expected that only occasionally a man conscientiously
              interested in the Prisoners themselves will find his place among the Prison officers.
              And when he does, he is likely to be so outvoted by a majority as to deprive his
              humane propositions of any beneficial effect.

            But towering above all questions of personal interest, all questions of mere economy,
              is the reformation of the convicts considered simply in the light of a moral good
              accomplished. If  it should cost double the
              present system-ten times the amount, we should be inexcusable for rejecting a
              proposition which held out a reasonable hope for the reformation of any considerable
              proportion of the convicts.

            We send missionaries to all the continents and islands of the earth-to every clime-to
              every latitude and longitude-to reclaim the heathen and idolater to christian
              civilization. Here gathered in the walls of a prison are the congregated barbarians of
              the state-men of onr own nation, and race, and kindred, whose moral degradation is a
              constant appeal for more light.

            The condition of these men is partly their misfortune, partly their fault. They are
              generally ignorant, a large proportion being unable to read. A still larger proportion
              of them as we ascertained, are the victims of the wine-cup. If we go into their
              private histories we find them to have been children of drunkards, or orphans, or
              children brought up in the street. Born with a degraded constitution, subject to
              debasing surroundings, in their childhood many of them have been almost as completely
              shut off from the benignant influences of a higher civilization as if they had lived
              in Timbuctoo or the Fejee Islands. Taking into the account their circumstances-the
              history of their early lives, they strongly appeal, at once to our reason and our
              sympathies, demanding opportunities for mental and moral growth.

            The State demands their improvement. As citizens of a commonwealth honorable among
              her sisterhood of states, glorious in her history and grand in her promised future, we
              should allow no personal considerations, no selfish desires of men to cling to
              sinecure offices, to stand in the way of a measure promising so much for the future of
              Indiana,I know there are those who are constitutionally, I almost said infidel, to all
              human improvement, and who regard the fallen as permanently lost. They may perhaps,
              agree that sentiment looks well in print, and serves well to round the periods of a
              speech, but laugh at those whose deep and earnest convictions would make sentiment an
              existing fact-ridicule as visionaries and impracticables, those who would follow to
              their logical consequences, the great ethical principles of human nature and which lie
              at the foundation of human society. These are but the Jack Puncheons, the political
              charletans of society; however much they may pride in the misused and dishonored name
              of conservative. Eight is policy, and justice is practicable.

            Can convicts be reformed? Let us look at this question in the light of philosophy and
              in the presence of actual experiment. It is a well established principle, that any
              human faculty, whether moral or physical, is made strong by use and enfeebled by the
              want of it. "Exercise" says Spurzheim "strengthens power." The
              muscles of the blacksmith's arm grown strong from use. Daily effort has made John
              Winship a Hercules in physical strength.

            This principle applies as well to the moral as to the physical man. Our world is full
              examples of persons endowed by nature with only mediocre powers, who by persistent
              effort have become intellectually great.

            So too the examples are numerous of those who by persistent effort have subdued a,
              strong passional nature and raised themselves from a vicious to an honorable and
              conscientious life.

            Growth, whether moral or physical is a slow process. Its manifestations, sometimes
              indeed sudden, as where a powerful effort of the will has put base passions and
              immoral habits beneath the feet. But even this is the result of a long struggle
              upward, by which virtue gradually overcoming the passions and appetites culminates in
              a powerful and conquering resolve.

            So too, many persons have been dragged down by their evil surroundings, from good to
              bad, from bad to worse, until passion and appetite overtopping the reason and the
              moral sense become their masters. Here the same principle applies. "Exercise
              strengthens powers," Men have fallen, become criminals and outlaws, not because
              they were by nature worse or more depraved than thousands who have not fallen, but
              because of their more vicious surroundings.

            Fallen men and women have changed their course of life-climbed up into habits of
              virtue, not because they were better by nature than thousands of fallen who have not
              climbed, but because of circumstances that have strongly opperated to their reason and
              moral nature and enabled them to make the resolve to reform.

            Now human nature is the same wherever found-whether in a State Prison or out of it,
              men possess the same passions and emotions-are subject to the same laws-The Prison
              Reform proposes to apply these laws, and make them the instruments of reform.

            The prisoner in the Penitentiary is peculiarly susceptible of improvement. Whoever
              visits the State Prison-converses with the prisoners in their cells-sees them at their
              daily vocations-meets them in the chapel, and reads in their anxious countenances the
              emotions struggling in their souls, will never repeat the falsehood that the convict
              is hopelessly lost. Those who tell us that the doorsill of the Penitentiary-marks the
              line between possible virtue and hopeless depravity-between possible reformation and
              hopeless ruin-but proclaim their ignorance of human nature and human experience.

            It is not true as too readily believed, that the condition of imprisonment
              necessarily precludes the possibility of moral influence. Cut off from companions who
              have led them into  crime, - away from the
              temptations that have overcome his better nature, occupying a position the legitimate
              consequence of his crime,-with the long silent hours of his cell for meditation the
              convict has peculiar opportunities for moral improvement, and is singularly
              susceptible, as the Chaplains all testify, to moral influences.

            This being the fact, is it not our duty to surround the convicts by influences and
              opportuties which will tend to reformation, so that when their terms of service have
              expired they will not go back to society to repeat their offences, and drag others
              into the same vortex of crime. Let those who cannot read and write be taught to read
              and write. Let those who can read have a good library to draw from and light and other
              facilities for improvement in their cells.

            According to the report of the Chaplain, near two-thirds of all the convicts had
              been, before conviction given to habits of intemperance. According to the statement of
              the convicts themselves full three-fourths of all the convicts have found their way
              into the Penitentiary, directly or indirectly, through the influence of intemperance.
              Two or three years of total abstinence-two or three years imprisonment from the
              consequences of intemperance, with the teachings of the Chaplain and the example of
              officers and employes would in most cases cure the appetite and send the convict back
              to society reformed.

            But the argument is not all theory. Fortunately for those who have no faith in
              abstract truths, and who flout the deductions of reason actual, practical experience
              has demonstrated the capabilities of Prison life and discipline for the reformation of
              convicts. From Massachusetts, from Michigan, from Wisconsin, from the Eastern
              Penitentiary of Pennsylvania, and even from Ireland comes a concurrent and united
              voice declaring that the fallen may be raised up, and that enlightened Prison
              discipline may be made an efficient means of reformation. Mr. Cordier of Wisconsin,
              after he had been Warden four years, states that during that time two hundred and
              eighty-four convicts had been discharged, that of this number nine only had been
              returned. One of these at the time of his statement was the editor of an ably
              conducted monthly magazine; another was in the employ of the Government; and others
              were mechanics, farmers, laborers; and that all whom he had met were in prosperous
              circumstances, of sober habits and of exemplary character.

            Mr. Cordier is a humane man attracted to Prison labor on account of his sympathy for
              ye fallen, and his statement tells the result. To this other and valuable testimony
              could be added.

            It is sufficient to say that success in a single Prison demonstrates the possibility
              of success in every other. If convicts may be reformed in Ireland, Michigan, Maine,
              and Wisconsin, they may be reformed in Indiana.

            Let us not under estimate the value of this object. Aside from all motives of
              humanity-aside from all sympathy we may be supposed to have for the fallen, as a
              matter of State policy, few objects of legislation can more worthily command the
              attention of the General Assembly. The State Prison north and south contain about
              eight hundred convicts. Allowing these to be confined at an average of three years, it
              will follow that during every three years, there will be turned loose on society eight
              hundred discharged convicts. Whether or not these men-this army of convicts-shall be
              turned loose on society as useful citizens, or as recruits to the bands of leagued
              robbers, gamblers, incendiaries, and murderers of the State-this is a question of
              gigantic import, from which the honest legislator cannot avert his attention.

            Mr. President: It is industriously circulated that the authors of the proposed system
              are visionaries and impractical enthusists. I believe it is graciously admitted that
              they are honest in their views on the subject of Prison disipline, but being
              enthusiasts their counsels, it is held can not be safely followed.

            In reply to this it is sufficient to say that since the introduction of this Bill
              correspondence has been had with the most experienced Prison men in the United States,
              and it has been without exception, commended.

            It may be further added that this charge has been originated by those pecuniarily
              interested in the present system. Doubtless to these gentlemen, the loss of a sinecure
              position is impratical and visionary. But they should remember that the interests of
              the individual can not stand against the State. The public good is the supreme
              law.

            The system is nothing new nothing untried. We propose only to incorporate into the
              Prison law of Indiana principles which experience elsewhere has proved to be a
              success.

            The Commissioners will make changes only when changes are necessary-only where and
              when the interests of the Prison demand change. They will place the whole system on a
              reformatory basis and administer it according to the most advanced principles of
              Prison science.

            The influence of man on man is conceded to be great. The very look inspires in others
              corresponding emotions though not a word be spoken. Much more do actions speak and
              influence. But what motives of virtue are inspired in the mind of the canvict when one
              of the highest Prison officers approaches him with a proposition for a bribe? The road
              to freedom is not, as it should be, through the 
              gate of reformation but through the averice of the director. What motives for
              reformation are held out to the poor female convicts, when they are nightly made the
              victims of beastial lust by creatures viler than themselves? and these their
              keepers?

            I argue that this is a state of crime abnormal even in a penitentiary. But from a
              possibility it has become a disgusting fact. This ought to be the condemnation of the
              system that has permitted it.

            Under the proposed system you shall expect none of these things. No drunken Prison
              officer or employee shall seek in beastly debauch to drag to lower depths of
              degredation, the poor female convicts. No employees will be compelled to pay subsidies
              for their places; and no Prison directors take bribes for turning loose on society
              those whom it is their duty to confine and if possible reform. You shall not then
              expect the matron to exclaim in despair, as in her last report, that it is a painful
              reflection to see the female convicts, one by one, as they leave the Prison, with
              minds averse to good, with hearts full of sin, only to re-enact the scenes of their
              former life, and to sink still deeper in crime.

            Another impression is assidiously attempted to be made. It has been represented that
              the advocates of this Bill propose to relax the Prison disipline, and destroy the
              authority of Prison officers. Nothing can be further from the truth. It is indeed
              expected that kindness in many cases will take the place of severity, that the reason
              of the convicts will be appealed to, and that severity will be the last resort. But
              the strictest discipline will be enforced. But while the convict will be subjected to
              the strictest disciplin-while he is taught to work and to pay the expense of his
              keeping by his own labor. He will be surrounded by such humane and christianizing
              influences, as will give him better thoughts, raise him up from his degredation, and
              at the end of his term of service give him back to society prepared to discharge the
              duties of the citizen.

            Mr. President: I plead for these fallen unfortunate men and women, in the name of
              civilization itself-look over the earth-go back through the ages-and you will find
              everywhere and at all times, the established penal system an index to the civil and
              social state. Occasionally, it is true, a lawgiver or person in authority may rise up
              who may sink the Prison system below or raise it above, the average humanity of the
              age; but the rule is as I have stated it. The Knout of the Russian, the Bastinado of
              the Mussleman States, and the Whippingpost of certain States of this Union point
              unmistakably to a semi-barbarous state of society The Indian War dance is no more a
              mark of barbarism than the gauntlet though the captive must pass on the stake at which
              he is burnt. The millions who rose at the call of Xerxes to fall at Thermopylae,
              Marathon, and Salamie, are no stronger evidence of the tyrany of the rulers and the
              slavery of the people than are the studied tortures through which the Persian convict
              expiated his offense against the state. While the Galley slave of some of the European
              states proclaims to all the world that the rulers are tyrants and the people lost to
              the sense of honor, dignity and manhood.

            Take the penal system of any nation, trace its history from the savage slate, and you
              shall always find that the punitory laws keep step with the moral advancement of the
              people. Of this truth England is a notable example, a fact patent to all who are
              familiar with English history, or with the writers on English law.

            I insist that the time has come for Indiana to take an advanced step in her Prison
              system. Public sentiment has sufficiently advanced in refinement to demand that we put
              behind us all ideas of merely vindictive punishment, and make the reformation of the
              convict the leading object of Prison discipline. Public opinion is sufficiently
              enlightened to sustain a system founded in philosophy, and which practically applies
              in the management of convicts, the most advanced principles of penal science. The
              sentiments of Christian charity have become so much an element of public sentiment as
              to justify legislative enactments for the reformation even of the convicts of the
              Penitentiary. Public sentiment will not hold this General Assembly blameless if it
              suffers a system to remain saddled on the State capable of the disgusting vices
              recently brought to light in the southern Prison. The odium hangs on the State. We
              shall remove it by amending the Prison system and removing the guilty parties.

            I urge this because the evil is inherent in the present system-is the natural
              outgrowth of its animating spirit. If one set of corrupt men are removed by this
              General Assembly there is no security against the appointment of similar ones by some
              subsequent General Assembly. Not that the General Assembly does not desire good
              officers. But we are compelled, as I have already shown, to select among those of
              whose character we are ignorant and can therefore have no assurance that we are
              electing honest and capable persons.

            The present system is founded on the idea that there is no hope for the fallen. With
              this infidelity to improvement and reformation, it is natural that no effort should be
              made for the reformation of the convicts.

            We have a Chaplain indeed, for each of the Penitentiaries - good and efficient men I
              believe. But he is so cramped in his powers -so limited in his opportunities-and above
              all the parties over him have so little sympathy with his work, that his usefulness is
              in a great measure cut off.

            The records of the Prison show a cruelty - an absolute barbarism in the treatment of
              prisoners shocking to the sensibilities. Men have keen beaten worse than brutes for
              the most trivial offences, women whipped on their bare backs with an instrument that
              would make a southern overseer respectable in slavery's palmiest days. What could
              the Chaplain do? These cruelties were practiced or authorized by his superior
              officers. While the convicts could see over them men not better than themselves - men
              with whom some of them could have changed places to the benefit alike of both the
              prison and the State, what power for reform could the words of a single moral
              instructor have ?

            Under the proposed system no public plunderers will find places on the Prison Board.
              No wassailers and bouts would be appointed Wardens and Guards about the Prison. Only
              honest and humane persons would accept places on the Prison Board - such persons as
              would not be induced perhaps to come here and join in a scuffle for office. The
              convicts, instead of coming in contact with villians differing from themselves only in
              the fact of their not having been convicted of crime, would be surrounded by honest
              officers and guardsmen who could sympathise for fallen and whose presence would be a
              constant invitation to reform. Justice tempered mercy will be mete out to the
              convicts. They will be made to feel that the restraint and discipline to which they
              are subjected are for their own good, and that those about them are their friends.

            Mr. President: I feel deeply on this subject; and this is my apology for having taken
              much of the time of the Senate. During the late war our State made for herself a noble
              record. In the Congress of the United States her statesmen take rank among the first,
              Her executive, administrative, and judicial officers, give honor and dignity to the
              State. Let us remove the foul disgrace of the southern Prison and make haste to place
              her institutions on the level of the highest.

            Look down into the State Prisons. See there eight hundred of our fellow citizens as
              convicts. A large majority of them are young, susceptible of honest, humane, and
              generous impressions, pleading in their degredation for a little help,- peering
              through their moral darkness for more light.

            By so simple a word, as aye, on the passage of this, you will carry hope to their
              desponding,- light into their darkness. Do it and ages to come will honor the General
              Assembly who thus honored the commonwealth.

            Mr. JOHNSTON, of Montgomery, indicated his opposition to the bill.

            Mr. BRADLEY would support the bill with an amendment to the sixteenth section,
              striking out the provision that the term of a recaptured convict shall be increased by
              the judgment of the Board of Commissioners, and inserting in lieu a provision that the
              convict shall be required to serve for such further time in addition to his original
              term as the Court or jury trying the case shall determine.

            And then - 

            The Senate took a recess till two o'clock p. m.

            In the afternoon session the bill was amended and passed the Senate by yeas 29, nays
              8.

             [Mr. CRAVENS, from the Special Committee thereon, returned the bill [H. R. 119.]
              making an appropriation of four hundred and thirteen thousand five hundred and
              ninety-nine dollars and forty-eight cents to pay the claims of suffers by the Morgan
              Raid, with the following report:

            
              
                
                  

                  
                    MR. PRESIDENT
                  

                  : The Committee to whom was referred House Bill No. 119 a bill proposing relief
                    to the sufferers caused by the invasion of the State in 1863 by John Morgan, and
                    the rebel troops under his command, have had the same under consideration, and
                    have directed me to recommend the passage of the bill for the following among
                    other reasons:

                  In all governments voluntarily formed the 'Contract'between the
                    citizen individually and the citizen collectively is of a two-fold character,
                    first the citizen engages to render allegiance, service and Obedience; the state
                    solemnly promises protection to the citizen in person and property.

                  2d. The invasion in 1863 was an invasion of the State, a trespass upon the
                    rights of the citizen in the remote north as much as if the citizen had been in
                    the immediate line of march of the invaders, consequently all were equally
                    involved in the calamity.

                  3d. The citizens who were the immediate sufferers by the calamity - those of
                    southern Indiana while they were amply able to have organized forces to resist
                    and drive out the invaders, had surrendered their right so to do to the State
                    and naturally looked to the authority thus constituted to defend and protect
                    them.

                  4th. The State with abundant means both of men and arms at its disposal did not
                    provide in advance against the occurrence of the calamity. Had it done so the
                    losses would not have occurred. Small bodies of troops stationed at convenient
                    points on the Ohio river, when a wise regard for the public welfare would
                    naturally have dictated, would have been sufficient to prevent any attempt at
                    invasion. Neglect on the part of the State to prevent a threatened injury,
                    outrage or wrong is as culpable and as clearly a violation of the compact of
                    government as to commit the wrong itself; hence such neglect or refusal on the
                    part of the State, upon which rests the obligation to protect and defend its
                    citizens, makes that authority clearly liable for all the consequences that may
                    either directly or indirectly be traced to and result from that neglect or
                    injury.

                  5th. It may be said that the war of the rebellion was a war against the
                    Government of the United States. So it was, but the invasion was an invasion of
                    the State of Indiana, and the sufferers were the citizens of Indiana. These
                    citizens appeal to their own immediate government. This they know, they know its
                    authorities, where they can be found, and in what manner to approach them. The
                    State is the agent between its citizens and the Government of the United States,
                    as the latter would stand between the States and any foreign power.

                  6th. It is also said that these claims, in a technical point of view, are not
                    legitimate claims upon the State, but from what has before been advanced, if
                    these propositions are true, these claims are properly filed by the citizens
                    thereof against the State, and if the Genaral Government is ultimately liable it
                    will be proper and regular that the State should prefer them, in the aggregate
                    rather  than that the citizens individually
                    should loose the entire amount thereof in a fruitless effort to secure a
                    recognition of their claims. 

                  7th. This irruption by a public enemy was humiliation, outrage and trespass
                    upon the entire State, equally an infraction of the right of every citizen, but
                    the losses sustained by individuals are necessarily local. These losses are
                    greater in many instances than the victims are able to bear, and far more than
                    their share of the public burdens imposed by this public calamity- The sufferers
                    appeal to a public sense Of justice and only ask that those who enjoyed an
                    entire exemption from loss, contribute an equal proportion with themselves to
                    the material losses sustained. These were humiliations, insults and wrongs
                    incident to this invasion, which those more happily situated can neither
                    appreciate nor share. The people of southern Indiana make this appeal to the
                    entire State in the full confidence that the popular sense of justice will fully
                    authorize the General Assembly to afford the equitable relief, especially since
                    that relief will require less than one mill per pent, to each individual in the
                    State upon the value of his real and personal property.

                  Signed, JOHN K. CRAVENS, T. N. RICE,  E. HUFFMAN, F. J. BELLAMY,  GEO, W. DENBO,Special
                    Committee.
                
              
            

            Mr. HOOPER having made an ineffectual motion [it being 4 o'clock p. m.] that the
              Senate adjourn-

            Mr. FISHER Mr. President: I am opposed to this bill. I said on Saturday when this
              question was up, that I had understood that it was contended that if the State assumed
              the payment of this debt the General Government would refund it; and it was stated
              that it had refunded to Ohio a sum expended tor the payment of similar claims. I said
              this was not so; that the General Government had not refunded anything to the State of
              Ohio on account of damages paid for the Morgan Raid. The Senator from Switzerland said
              it was so. I understood the Senator as impeaching my information, not my veracity, and
              being desirous of being right, in the evening I sent 'he following dispatch to
              the Auditor of the State of Ohio. "Did the Government refund the amount paid for
              damages by the Morgan Raid?" and in reply I received a dispatch from him in these
              words: "No, but did refund expenses incurred in repelling the raid." Now
              that is just the thing that has been done in Indiana.I am unwilling, sir, that a
              deception should be practiced in order to secure the passage of bill. Either the
              parties who made the did not know of what they were 29speaking, or they spoke of what
              they did not know. The General Government has not refunded anything paid in
              liquidating this class of claims, and I undertake to say never will. I defy any
              Senator to produce an instance in the world's history where any Government has
              paid for damages done to private property by a common enemy.

            It is not recognized as a legal claim against any Government. The damages done by a
              common enemy are looked upon as visitations of providence-as the overflow of a
              river-as a tornado-or as a fire.

            The argument is that it is easier for the State to pay these damages than for the
              citizens to bear them. That argument would apply to the destruction of property by a
              tornado or by fire, as well. Then Senators I trust, will bear this in mind, that if
              the appropriation is made for the payment of these claims the money is gone forever;
              that there it not one particle of hope that the General Government will ever refund
              one single dollar.I observed one little remark in the report just read. It says that
              in the remote parts of this State the people have not suffered from the effects of
              this war. I do not so understand it. I think among the thousands, aye tens of
              thousands of wives and orphans who have suffered in this war many may be found in the
              remote parts of this State.

            We are asked to make an appropriation of four hundred and thirteen thousand five
              hundred and ninety-nine dollars to pay these claims. We have just reduced the taxes
              for State purposes from twenty to fifteen cents. To pay this we have got to increase
              these taxes to where they were before, for nearly five cents on the one hundred
              dollars will be required to pay this indebtedness if it is an indebtedness. There is
              not enough money in the treasury to meet the expenses of this Legislature and pay that
              demand. But the point I make is, that there is no obligation on the part of the State
              to pay those claimants. If there was any probability that the General Government would
              refund it I would be in favor of paying it. But I am not in favor of paying these
              damages by levying an additional tax on the hundreds of thousands of men who have
              toiled through this war, leaving their business at home to go to waste, and perhaps
              losing in a multitude of cases, more money than a majority of these people lost by the
              raid of Morgan. I am not in favor of taxing the little property of widows and orphans
              to make remuneration to these parties. A large sum is claimed for damage done to
              certain Railroads, which have grown rich out of the distress of the country by the
              transportation of supplies and troops. Sixty or more thousand dollars is adjudged due
              to Railroads for damage done to them. Then there were large distilleries  damaged and a large amount of whisky is included in this
              claim.

            But I supppose this bill is to pass. I understand the arrangements are all made and
              every man is known. I do not expect to change a vote bnt I do expect to raise my voice
              in opposition to the bill; and when it comes to the final vote to vote against it. If
              a majority of the Senate believe this bill ought to pass, it unquestionably will pass;
              but I cannot look upon it in that light and I shall have to vote against it, and then
              I shall have done my duty.

            Mr. CARSON, remarking that we ought to make haste slowly in this matter, made an
              ineffectual motion to adjourn-yeas 16, nays 29.

            Mr. HOOPER. Mr. President: As I desire briefly to state the reasons why I shall vote
              againt this bill I embrace this opportunity to do so. I regret that there should be a
              disposition manifested to pass through a measure of so much importance as this, with
              the haste that seems to be desired. I regret the disposition to hurry through a bill
              which proposes to appropriate from the treasury four hundred and thirteen thousand
              dollars-a sum that will certainly reach the bottom of the Treasury unless there is a
              further levy on the people of this State in the shape of taxes. We have already
              appropriated sums amounting to over a milion of dollars. This, with the taxes levied,
              is about as much burden as the State can stand. But beyond all this, it certainly is
              important for us, in a proposition like this, to be satisfied beyond a doubt that it
              is a claim we ought to allow.

            At the last session we appointed a Committee to investigate this question. We found
              that these claims are divided off into classes. The first and second classes are all
              against the General Government and will be paid as soon as they are proven and
              established. They are for losses sustained on account of Union troops. Now why should
              the State of Indiana step in and fasten this claim upon the State when it is a good
              claim against the General Government and will be allowed? There are a dozen Senators
              within the sound of my voice who have been presenting this very class of claims, and
              know they are paying claims of this sort. This disposes of about eighty-two thousand
              dollars of these claims. There is no reason why the State should step in and assume
              this debt. If the State does assume to pay these claims and these parties get their
              money in this direction we take away the necessity for their furnishing proof of these
              claims against the General Government. We know the General Government has not been
              allowing these claims without proof.

            What are the bulk of these claims? Sir, I say to the Senate they are claims we are
              under no legal obligations to assume. These claimants have no legal demand against the
              State nor the General Government for these claim As has been well said by the Senator
              from Wabash [Mr. Fisher] you cannot lay your hand upon a single authority that will
              show that these claims are recognized as binding upon the Government. Then is it right
              for us to establish a precedent like this? Is it right that we should step out and
              allow such claim amounting to such a vast sum? It would be entering upon dangerous
              ground, and establishing a precedent that no legislative body ought to establish. The
              only sale rule to adopt if to allow claims only to those who have a legal demand for
              them. There is no demand in right or under the law for these claims. They cannot be
              sustained in law or by reason. The first and second class we should not allow, and the
              third are a class of claims the parties have no claims against the State for. They
              have no right to make a demand of the State for them. When you go out of law and enter
              upon ground such as this;-upon the mere pleasure of the General Assembly, you enter
              upon dangerous ground, and open a door to which there may be no limit. I apprehend
              these claims will be pressed upon the clemency and generosity of the State, for I
              suppose no Senator will argue that for the third and fourth class, the State is under
              any legal obligation.

            Let us look at this question on both sides. It is true many of these claimants have
              lost property under circumstances of hardship; but a large part of these losses have
              been sustained by parties who can well afford to bear them, It has been stated by the
              Senator from Wabash that Railroads who have grown rich over the transportation of
              soldiers present a large amount of these claims. This bill proposes merely to restore
              to those in good circumstances, (though some may be in poor circumstances ) what they
              have lost by the fortunes of war. To equalize the burdens of this war is something
              impossible to do. All over this State today are persons who have sustained losses
              absolutely irreparable: you cannot restore to them their losses. Around me to-day are
              men who have been shot to pieces and crippled for life. Do you pretend to make good
              the losses they have sustained? The widows all over our land have sustained
              irreparable losses, and it is impossible to restore these losses; so I repeat, you
              cannot equalize the losses sustained by this war. And if you are to place this on the
              ground of generosity alone, then you ought to restore, as far as possible, all the
              losses sustained by the widows and orphans of the State. Their losses are greater than
              these parties who lost property only.

            There is no end to this kind of legislation. Injustice is inevitable when you tax
              these parties who have sustained great losses that you  cannot repair, and make them contribute to pay the losses
              of property of those parties in the southern part of the State. By this proposition
              you propose to gather into the treasury a pittance from these parties and take it out
              and pay it over to those who have sustained losses in consequence of this Morgan raid.
              I say there is no justice in it; none whatever;-there cannot be in my judgment. The
              first part of these claims are good against the General Government, and there is
              nothing to be gained whatever by the State's assumption of them;-there is no
              reason why the State should assume these claims. But there is good reason, why she
              should not-for if you pass this law you fix them irrevokably upon the State, There is
              no probability you ever will be relieved from them, because 'the great incentive
              to furnish the necessary proof to establish these claims would be gone and they would
              be irrevokably fastened upon the State. Parhaps claimants have no legal demand against
              the State. Whenever you depart from and go outside of the law for the purpose of
              allowing claims you enter upon dangerous ground and there is no protection for the
              State. The party that may be strong in the Legislature may go to work and appropriate
              money that has been gathered from the people of the State to any purpose they see fit,
              if they are to go outside of any legal claims on the State. This bill proposes to
              enter upon dangerous ground and it should not be sustained by the Senate.

            Mr. HANNA. Mr. President: The arguments of the report presented by the Committee are
              advanced in the nature of propositions. The first is: In all governments voluntarily
              formod the contract between the citizen individually and the citizen collectively is
              of a two-fold character, first the citizen engages to render allegiance, service and
              obedience; the state solemnly promises protection to the citizen in person and
              property.

            That is a proposition that cannot be avoided in this form of government. No man owes
              allegiance or obedience to a government unless that government protects him in person
              and property as far as it is able. Now what else does this report say?

            "The State with abundant means both of men and arms at its disposal did not
              provide in advance against the occurrence of the calamity. Had it done so the losses
              would not have occurred. Small bodies of troops stationed at convenient points on the
              Ohio fiver, when a wise regard for the public welfare would naturally have dictated,
              would have been sufficient to prevent any attempt at invasion. Neglect on the part of
              the State to prevent a threatened injury, outrage or wrong is as culpable and as
              clearly a violation of the compact of government as to commit the wrong itself; hence
              such neglect or refusal on the part of the State, upon which rests the obligation, to
              protect and defend its citizens, makes that authority clearly liable for all the
              consequences that may either directly or indirectly be traced to and result from that
              neglect or injury." 

            Now; sir, if that is true, I take it that the action of this Senate is marked and
              plain. A government requires obedience of its citizens, and as an evidence of it
              thousands of men went from the Second Congressional District in the very region of
              country through which John Morgan marched. At that time their families were
              unprotected. The men were under the flag of their country and away from the places
              they might have defended. They obeyed the voice of their country; and with an
              abundance of means, both of men and arms their State Government failed to adopt that
              wise policy which common prudence would dictate. The Government according to this
              report, failed to do what was required of it. As the citizen has to obey the
              government and render service to the government, the government must protect the
              citizen in person and property.

            What are the facts as they have passed into history? Thousands of men were around
              this city, and for what? Perhaps to protect cowardly persons, while the whole border
              all along the Ohio Elver was left unprotected. Men from the Second Congressional
              District were here standing around Indianapolis to protect the officials in their
              fancied danger. I say the State failed to do its duty because it was governed worse
              than any state ever was governed. Why? Because the whole border was left unprotected.
              Here is four hundred and thirteen thousand dollars worth of property of our citizens
              seized and carried off because fnrsooth, those in authority failed to discharge their
              duty. They were looking to the glittering generalities. They were looking to the
              sending of dispatches to the press. Publicity tickled their eyes. Somebody was
              employed to telegraph so many troops forwarded to the South; and so many boxes of
              provisions and clothing sent to the soldiers in the field. Everything was done except
              what should have been done, and that was to look to the welfare of the State of
              Indiana. The State is bound to extend protection to her citizens. The report says that
              common prudence would have averted this calamity. Every one knows it was rumored when
              Morgan was about to make his raid in this State, and yet the body of the troops which
              should have been stationed all along this exposed line were at the centre of the
              State> some eighty or hundred miles from the border., I say that laid the whole
              people of the State liable to bare the burdens of the property destroyed there.
              Because when the people of the State put those in authority who failed to discharge
              their duty, the whole people of the State was responsible for the acts of those in
              authority.

            

            Now it is said that there is no legal claim here against the Government. As a lawyer
              I acknowledge that when the Chairman of the Committee on Public Expenditures reported
              that there was no legal liability against the United States or the State of Indiana
              for a large portion of this claim he appealed to my conscience. It is for every
              Senator to rise in his place and say in his conscience "can I vote that the
              property of the soldier who was away from home fighting the battles of his country
              shall be used and carried off by a common enemy while I sat at my ease in the north
              part of the State, and because there is a technicality of law standing between the
              right of the soldier, refuse to reimburse him from the public treasury for his
              loss?" Suppose war should be declared against England and British troops should
              invade the north part of this State from the Canada line, then we would hear those in
              that section coming up and asking for reimbursement for the destruction of their
              property. Now I say there is no legal 'obligation resting upon the State to pay
              about three hundred thousand dollars of these claims and if you are so ungenerous as
              to refuse to pay them the claims of these men are gone forever. They have already laid
              out of them;some four or five years and now they claim this not as a matter of legal
              justice; but merely as a matter of justice and equity they appeal to you to give them
              something for the great losses they have sustained losses which transpired because of
              the insufficiency of the authority stationed in this city at that time. Those people
              surrendered their power down there to organize for the defence of their homes by
              giving to the authorities their men who had been taken from them to bear arms, and yet
              when their property is destroyed you will sit back and say: "No we will not pay
              it." I say this thing of looking to the Government of the United States for
              everything has become a cancer upon the body politic of this country. The report is
              right in that? The report is not subject to criticism as to its justness, correctness
              and truthfulness. Even the dictates of the commonest prudence might have prevented
              this thing in the southern part of the State. We ought to adopt the report whether we
              pass the bill or not.

            Mr. GRAY. Mr. President: These claimants have my sympathy but my conscience will not
              allow me to vote for that bill and I do not think it is a claim upon the State of
              Indiana. I do not like this report. I differ with the Senator from Sullivan [Mr.
              Hanna] when he says the report speaks the truth. This John Morgan raid started in the
              State of Tennessee, and how could the state authorities of Indiana have prevented that
              invasion? How could our state authorities know the strength of the forces that would
              invade the State?

            The Senator from Sullivan says the people of those counties on the border surrendered
              their rights by which they could organize of themselves;-I suppose he means in
              companies on regiments. I will say that there were arrangements made-there were orders
              given the people were requested to organize themselves upon the southern border, and
              throughout the State, into companies, battalions, and regiments. They did so in a
              great many districts and the Governor appointed the officers. J know from personal
              experience, that Governor Morton urgently called upon the people of the State, and
              especially upon the people of the southern counties to organize themselves for the
              purpose of defending the southern border. And I assert, if this report is intended to
              reflect either upon the State authorities the Legislature or the Governor, that it is
              an undue reflection and has no authority or foundation in fact.

            I do not now speak in regard to the merits of the bill. If the theory adduced by the
              Senator from Sullivan is true, I would ask what would the State of Kentucky have done
              during the war? Suppose the State of Kentucky should have to pay all the claims for
              damages sustained by the citizens of Kentucky during the late war, could the State of
              Kentucky ever pay them? Suppose you say that the State in not having provided the
              necessary means of defense has not done its duty, and consequently the State of
              Kentucky is responsible for whatever damages the citizens of the State have sustained,
              is there wealth enough in the State to pay these claims? If that doctrine is good
              here, it will hold good every where. But the doctrine won't hold water.

            This report goes on to say: The State did not furnish any defence "against the
              occurrence of the calamity. Had it done so the losses would not have occurred. Small
              bodies of troops stationed at convenient points on the Ohio river, when a wise regard
              for the public welfare would naturally have dictated, would have been sufficient to
              prevent any attempt at invasion." John Morgan had a formidable force, and it is
              saying too much to say that this State could have been acquainted with the force that
              would invade the State. Now the the report says further: "Neglect on the part of
              the State to prevent a threatened injury, outrage or wrong is as culpable and as
              clearly a violation of the compact of government as to commit the wrong itself; hence
              such neglect or refusal on the part of the State upon which rests the obligation to
              protect and defend its citizens, makes that authority clearly liable o all the
              consequences that may either directly or indirectly be traced to and result from that
              neglect or injury."

            What does that mean? Why it means that Indiana, by not taking the proper means  prevent this invasion has been guilty as much Of
              committing that wrong as those who invaded the State themselves! Is this Senate ready
              to say so? Is it ready to say that Governor Morton or the Legislature is as guilty by
              failing to furnish means for the defense of the State, as the men who invaded the
              State? That is more than I am willing to say, and if I was going to vote for this bill
              I could not vote for that report.

            I will not vote to put my State in the wrong, or gay that by neglect the act of those
              in authority was wrong. Is there a Senator here willing to put that blame upon the
              State? If there is he ought to vote for the bill. My constituents and all that part of
              the State think these are claims the State should not pay, and I am here to reflect
              their opinion. I do think that the report ought not to be adopted. It seems to me
              there underlies, in that report, something or other. It seems to me the Committee went
              beyond what there was any necessity for, to strike somebody. There is a great deal
              more said than ought to be gaid, for I hold that in all the thirty-five States in
              existence during the war there was not in this Union a more patriotic, able, or
              efficient Governor than Oliver P. Morton, of Indinna. His record will speak for
              itself. 

            Mr. TURNER Mr. President: I would like to talk some myself, but rise to move the
              previous question.

            The demand for the previous question was sustained by the Senate-upon a
              division-affirmative 24, negative 17.

            Under its pressure the report was rejected by yeas 23, nays 25, as follows:

            Mr. CARSON, when his name was called, protested against coming to a vote upon a
              Question involving such vast interests without permitting Senators equally interested
              with others on this floor to be heard upon this subject. He did not believe the report
              was true in law or in fact; and voted "no."

            Mr. CRAVENS, when his name was called, said I was both pleased and sorry that the
              previous question was called, for I would like to have replied to some remarks that
              have been made, especially by my right hand friend [Mr. Gray,] who has put a very
              gratuitous on upon the general proposition stated the report. He has put up a man of
              straw and shown his ability to knock it down. I for the purpose of disclaiming any
              personal party or particular allusion at all; it is a simple announcement of a general
              proposition, and that is the character of every one of the propositions in the report
              of the Committee. It was drafted by myself, suggested by myself, and I believe every
              word is true in it, and that there is no man who can controvert any proposition in
              it.

            Mr. GRAY (interposing) I will ask the Senator what he means when he speaks of the
              State having neglected to protect its citizens.

            Mr. CRAVENS. The report says that the neglect or the refusal on the part of the State
              to provide in advance against a threatened injury where it has the means to do so is
              as culpable as to commit the offense itself; and I say no man can deny it.

            Mr. GRAY (in his seat.) Who should have done it?

            Mr. CRAVENS. The people of Indiana-Southern Indiana was helpless; the enemy was at
              their door; these raids were liable to be made there at any time and while these men
              in the northern part of the State were in security we were left there without an
              organization to repel an invasion. But I rose simply to state that the report but
              stated a general proposition, and there was no party significance in it.

            Mr. FISHER, when his name was called, said: My recollection of this matter referred
              to by the Senator from Jefferson [Mr. Cravens.] is different from his. He states that
              the southern border was helpless. I speak knowingly when I say that there was an
              organized regiment of men in every border county during' that time, ready to be
              called out. The difficulty was they had no horses with which to catch Morgan, and they
              could not do it on foot.

            Mr. GREEN, when his name was called said: I no not like the language of the report
              very well, but as I shall vote for the bill, I presume I had better cast my vote in
              the affirmative, though I don't like some of the language of the report.

            Mr. HAMILTON, when his name was called, said: I hope I will be permitted to explain
              my vote. I feel like an individual that approached me once at the close of a meeting
              when I did not give him the privilege of joining the church, and said that I had
              deprived him of a privilege he thought he had. I thought I had the privilege to speak
              on this subject but I find I am deprived of that privilege. In the first place I would
              just as soon be found voting to disgrace my wife as to vote for this report with the
              explanations that have been given on this floor. I am not prepared to say that by the
              exercise of the commonest prudence there would have been no such thing as the Morgan
              raid. I propose to say that if it had  not been
              known that there were people in this State who sympathised with the rebellion Morgan
              never would have crossed the Ohio Riven For fear you will conclude that I am out of
              order (and have got a speech in me half an hour long,) I vote "no" all the
              time.

            Mr. CRAVENS (interposing.) Where do you find the language used "common
              prudence?"

            Mr. HAMILTON. I got it from a man who held the papers.

            Mr. CRAVENS. The repors says "a wise regard for the public welfare" would
              have prevented the invasion.

            Mr. HAMILTON. If this press gang had not been put upon us we would have had that all
              explained. I vote "no," believing that my constituents will back me up.

            Mr. HUMPHREYS, in explanation of his vote when his name was called, said: I shall
              vote for the report, not committing myself for the bill. I vote "aye."

            Mr. RICE, when his name was called in explanation of his vote said: I disclaim, along
              with the Chairman of the Committee [Mr. Cravens] any intention on the part of the
              Committee in stating a general proposition to strike at the officials of the State at
              the time of this raid.

            Mr. ROBINSON of Madison, when his name was called, said: I have voted for a similar
              bill to this every time it has come up for the last two years, but I think this bill
              ought to be amended. I do not think this bill ought to pass unless there is some
              amendment. I vote "aye."

            Mr. STEIN in explanation of his vote when his name was called said: In the light of
              the information we have received to-day I cannot support the bill as it stands. When
              it first came into the Senate as Senate bill No. 97 it was referred to the Committee
              on Public Expenditures. Their report came in and it justified no legislation on the
              subject. In the course of that report it was declared that the State of Ohio had paid
              off similar claims to a large amount, and that the United States had reimbursed the
              same, and we have herethfore been assured in debate on this floor that the State of
              Ohio has paid claims of this kind; and I was perfectly willing to vote for the bill in
              the light of this information, taking it for granted that the precedent set in Ohio
              would be followed by the General Government. But I find this evening that we have been
              resting under a delusion, and hence I cannot take the risk. I would have been
              perfectly willing to vote for this bill with the assurances before us heretofore; but
              they having been dispelled I shall therefore vote "no."

            Mr. WOLCOTT, when his nams was called, in explanation of his vote said: Mr.
              President: I am opposed to this report, believing it to be untrue in law and false in
              deduction of facts. I will admit the general proposition as stated in the report that
              in all governments voluntarily formed-it is the principle of obedience to all
              governments "that the contract between the citizens individually and collectively
              is of a twofold character; first that the citizen engages to render allegiance,
              service and obedience; the state solemnly promises protection to the citizen in person
              and property." While that as a general proposition is true, and as a general
              proposition is subject to an indefinite number of exceptions, it is not true in point
              of law as far as a case of this kind is concerned. The true law is also general law. A
              commission is now sitting in this city embracing such claims against the Government of
              the United States. The law says that this commission shall proceed, subject to the
              rules prescribed by law, to examine the expenditures made by such state etc. That is
              the general law, the broad principle here announced--

            Mr. CRAVENS (interrupting.) Mr. President; We are all of us cut off from going into
              an argument on this subject by the previous question.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. It will be impossible for the chair to rule what a Senator
              shall say.

            Mr. CRAVENS. It is easy to distinguish between a labored argument of the question and
              the explanation of a vote.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. If the Senator desires to state the reasons for his vote he
              has that privilege.

            Mr. WOLCOTT. Reasons for a vote sometimes involve an argument of the question in a
              broad sense. The principle endeavored to be applied to this case would apply to every
              calamity with which men are afflicted. It would apply to the small pox, to the
              measles, and to a case where a man is injured by being thrown out of his carriage. No
              body believes any such doctrine is true to govern this case or any other case. The law
              of protection is well supported by national usage. I need not go farther than to say
              that when the report was made last session by the Committee on Expenditures that
              report was adopted by a unanimous vote, the Senate affirming the general
              interpretation of law on that subject. Then again as to the State's ability to
              protect the border, there was but one way of protecting the border. Had she kept her
              troops out of the field no invasion would have taken place. When we had gunboats
              patroling up and down the Ohio river, to say that the State was neglecting her duty is
              to state what is not true. I vote "no."

            Mr. WOOD, when his name was called, said: Without indicating how I shall vote upon
              the bill finally, I will vote "no," as I think the report should not be
              adopted.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR when  the casting vote
              said: If the Chair is to vote, the Chair is privileged to give his reasons. If the
              Chair should be called upon to vote on the bill, I should vote "aye," for I
              believe the bill to be right, but I do not believe the statements in this report are
              true, and can not cast my vote to concur in a report that casts censure upon a
              Governor of this State. I therefore vote "no."

            So the report was rejected.

            And then-

            The Senate adjourned.

          
          

          
            IN SENATE.
            
               TUESDAY, May 11, 1869.
            

             Mr. CRAVENS asked and obtained leave to withdraw the report of the Special Committee
              on the Morgan raid bill, [H. R. 119,] submitted yesterday afternoon, and printed on
              pages 376 and 377 of these Reports-the vote thereon having been reconsidered for that
              purpose.

            
              AFTERNOON SESSION.
              [IN CONTINUATION-p. 207.]

              Mr. TURNER moved to suspend the order of business in order to press to its passage
                the Morgan raid bill [H. R. 119.]

              The motion was agreed to by yeas 25, nays 19.

              Mr. JAQUESS moved to amend the bill by striking out the emergency clause and
                inserting a section providing for the levying of a tax to pay said claims.

              The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR decided the amendment out of order as all bills raising
                revenue must originate in the House of Representatives.

              Mr. HANNA demanded the previous question.

              The demand was seconded upon a division of the Senate affirmative, 22 negative
                22-the Lieutenant Governor voting "aye."

              The main question being "shall the bill be now read the third time?"-

              The yeas and nays were demanded, and having been ordered and taken resulted-yeas
                16, nays 28, as follows:

              
                
                  
                    YEAS-Messrs. Andrews, Bellamy, Bradley, Cravens, Denbo,
                      Eliott, Gifford, Hanna, Henderson, Huey, Huffman, Humphreys, Laselle, Lee,
                      Montgomery and Taggart-16.

                    NAYS-Messrs. Beardsley, Carson, Case, Caven, Church,
                      Fisher, Fosdick, Gray, Green, Hadley, Hamilton, Hess, Hooper, Jaquess, Johnson
                      of Spencer, Kinley, Morgan, Rice, Reynolds, Robinson of Madison, Robinson of
                      Decatur, Scott, Sherrod, Smith, Stein, Turner, Wolcott and Wood-28.
                  
                
              

              Pending the roll call-

              Mr. CARSON, when his name was called,said: I vote "no" because, in my
                opinion, after having expressed a desire to be heard on this subject, this is an
                unfair mode of legislation.

              Mr. DENBO, when his name was called said: There have been some fears expressed that
                after this bill is passed there will be no further legislation. I can assure every
                senator here as far as members of the Democratic party are concerned they will stay
                here till Thursday evening at least. I vote "aye."

              Mr. GRAY, when his name was called said: I wish to make an explanation why I shall
                vote "no." Whenever a proposition has been made to suspend the rules for
                the gravel road bill or the fee and salary bill, the Senate has paid no attention to
                it, but here is a proposition to take nearly half a million of dollars out of the
                Treasury, and the Senate takes up the bill. I think that is paying no attention to
                the interests of the people and a great deal of attention to paying money out of
                their pockets.

              Mr. GREEN, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called said: I have been
                set down as among the friends of the bill, but there were some things developed
                yesterday and being developed, and I desire further light upon the subject. Not
                wishing to indicate that I shall vote against the bill, I vote "no"
                now.

              Mr. HADLEY, when his name was called said: I desire to make a record on this bill
                and this may be the last opportunity. I am opposed to the manner in which this bill
                has been rushed through. I desire to be heard upon it. I regard it as a species of
                class legislation, wholly unjust and unfair, and for these reasons I vote
                "no."

              Mr. HOOPER, when his name was called said: In explanation of my vote I wish to say
                that I regard this as simply an outrage to press through a measure of such
                importance in this way. I desire to offer an amendment making the payments in one
                two and three years; and there seems to be a determination that an amendment of this
                kind shall not be made; and that these four hundred and thirteen thousand dollars
                shall be wrenched from the Treasury at once. We should give proper consideration to
                this bill. There is a party in the majority here that will be held responsible for
                this whole matter.

              Mr. JAQUESS, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called said: I had made
                up my mind to vote for this bill, but as its friends are disposed to thrust it ahead
                of every thing else, and as there has not been more than enough money provided for,
                according to the levy, to meet the appropriations that have been made I shall be
                compelled to vote against it. I vote "no."

              Mr. TURNER. Mr. President: I see that some of the friends of this bill seem
                desirous  for further time to connsider it, and
                if it is agreeable I will withdraw my motion. I ask the consent of the Senate to
                withdraw the motion.

              VOICES-"No consent," "no consent."

              Mr. JOHNSON, of Spencer, when his name was called said: Without indicating what my
                vote will be on the final passage of this bill I vote against the third reading of
                it now. I vote "no."

              Mr. SHERROD, in explanation of his vote when his name was called, said: I believe
                my mind is made up with regard to this question, but as I am not in favor of
                checking debate upon any important question I vote "no."

              Mr. SMITH, when his name was called, said: I desire to explain my vote, being cut
                off from debate by the previous question. It is well known to the friends of this
                bill that I have had some opposition to it. The Senator from Whitley [Mr. Hooper]
                has an amendment that we could not get in, for paying off these claims in one, two
                and three years time; and under such an arrangement as that I could vote for the
                bill. The friends of this bill have made strong appeals to us. Now, Huntington
                county furnished men during the days of the draft, and in the days of the war we
                could not get our right credits; and after the war was over we found some 139 of our
                men were credited to another county, and we had to make up that deficiency, and in
                order to do so our county paid five hundred dollars a head which amounted to about
                eigty-two thousand dollars. I vote "no."

              Mr. TURNER, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called said: As I cannot
                withdraw my motion, by my vote I will do so. I vote "no."

              Mr WOLCOTT, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote said: As this bill
                now stands before the Senate, it is thrust in violently and to the exclusion of
                matters of great general interest throughout the State his is a bill of purely local
                interest. It is also a bill for the payment of a large amount of money to persons
                who have no legal or equitable claim for the same, but only a sort of a claim upon
                our compassion. The first effect of this measure, if passed, will be to take from
                the Treasury all the money we have and leave nothing to defray the current expenses
                of the State. I vote "no."

              The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR then announced the vote.

              So the Senate refused to order the bill read the third time by yeas 16, nays
                28.

              Mr. CARSON made an ineffectual motion to adjourn-yeas 30 nays 31.

              Mr. JAQUESS moved that when the Senate adjourned, it be till half past seven
                o'clock to-night.

              The motion was rejected by yeas 17, nays 26.

              Mr. HOOPER moved to amend the bill by striking out the emergency clause and adding
                to section one as follows:

              Provided further that said claims shall be paid in, the following manner, to-wit:
                One third of each claim in one year, one third in two years, and one third in three
                years from the time of the taking; effect of this act, without interest.

              He offered this amendment in good faith to protect the people from the oppression
                that would inevitably follow. Our people are heavily taxed; we have a large
                delinquent list in almost every county in the State, and many-counties are unable to
                pay it. A little reflection will satisfy us that such is the fact.

              Mr. CRAVENS. Mr. President: I rise simply for the purpose of saving time; and
                on-behalf of the friends of the bill propose to accept at once the proposition of
                the Senator from Whitley [Mr. Hooper.]

              Mr. CARSON. Mr. President: The Senator from Whitley offers this proposition not
                because the State of Indiana is liable for a dollar of this vast amount of four
                hundred and thirteen thousand dollars, but because he sees the evidence which might
                convince a man of less faith than myself that that amount of money is to be
                appropriated in this way out of the Treasury of the State of Indiana. I have more
                confidence in this Senate than that. If these men have a just claim, I am one in
                favor of paying it now, and that too, with interest from the time it accrued.

              But shall we as Senators and men upon the floor of this Senate espousing the
                interests of the State of Indiana-shall we make snch an obligation as that? No! I
                take it not. I am on record on this subject in the BREVIER REPORTS and in the journals of 1865.

              This matter is sprung upon us here now-a matter involving nearly half a million of
                dollars, and I have not time to hunt up authorities. Look at the transaction of
                yesterday. A report came in, in relation to this claim seeking to lay down
                principles of equitable liability on the part of the State for these claims and that
                report was withdrawn this forenoon. My record is made in relation to that report.
                The report is not of record on the journals of this Senate, however, it having been
                withdrawn by the consent of the Senate.

               A call of the Senate was demanded and being ordered and taken, forty members
                answered to their names.

              The amendment was agreed to.

              The bill was then ordered to be read the third time by yeas 30, nays 9.

              Mr. CARSON made an ineffectual motion to adjourn.

              The bill [H. R. 119] appropriating four hundred and thirteen thousand five hundred
                and ninety-nine dollars and thirteen cents to pay claims of sufferers by the Morgan
                raid, being read the third time-

              

               Mr. BELLAMY demanded the previous question.

              The Senate seconded the demand, and under its pressure The bill passed the Senate
                by yeas 26, nays follows:

              Pending the roll call-

              Mr. JOHNSON, of Spencer, when his name was called, in explanation said: Mr.
                President: I have some misgivings as to the vote I am about to give on this bill. I
                have been ranked among the voters against it, but I have come to the conclusion that
                in all human probability this claim will-one day be paid out of our State Treasury,
                as it seems to be gathering strength every time it is brought up in this body. I
                greatly prefer its being paid now than at any other time, as the claims are now in
                the hands of each individual claimant, and at some subsequent time they will be
                brought up by a few individuals. I have concluded with a great deal of reluctance to
                vote for this-bill as it now stands believing that it is better to pay the claims
                now than after they are owned by a few individuals.

              The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR announced the vote as above recorded.

              So the bill passed. 

            
            
          
          

          

          
            SUPPLEMENTARY  TO THE BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
              VOLUME ELEVENTH.
            Municipal Taxation of Bank Shares----Mr, Chapman's Liquor
              Bill----Debate in Continuation,
            IN SENATE.
            
               THURSDAY, May 13, 1869.
            
            [IN CONTINUATION-p. 220.]

             On motion of Mr. GRAY, the bill [H. R. 170,] a bill to provide for the assessment
              and collection of taxes for municipal purposes on the shares of stock owned in banks
              or banking associations doing business in this State, was taken up.

            Mr. RICE, in behalf of the majority of the Judiciary Committee
              made the following report:

            
              
                
                  
                  
                    MR. PRESIDENT:
                  
                   The Committee on the Judiciary, to which was referred House
                    Bill No. 170, "to provide for the assessment and collection of taxes for
                    municipal purposes, on the shares of stock owned in Banks, and Banking
                    Associations doing business in this State," have had the same under
                    consideration and have directed us to make the following report:

                  The bill, in its terms, applies to the stock of "all Banks and Banking
                    Associations," but it is well known that its principal object is to reach
                    the stocks in National Banks. The questions are:

                  1st. Whether such stock now bears a fair proportion of the burthens of
                    taxation, and,

                  2d. Whether the Legislature can rightfully authorize incorporated cities and
                    towns to tax the stock of National Banks for municipal purposes.

                  We will consider these questions separately and in the order stated.

                  The Official Report of the Comptroller of the currency for 1868, page 19, shows
                    the amount of tax paid by National Banks in each State and in the United States
                    :

                  The National Banks in the State of Indiana paid in the year as follows:

                  
                    
                      To the United States,
                      $278,797 60
                    
                    
                      To the State, Counties and Tps.
                      200,372 89
                    
                    
                      Making a total tax paid per annum by the National Banks of this
                        State,
                      $479,170 49
                    
                  

                  From the same official source it will be seen that the average rate of tax paid
                    by National Banks in the United States amounted to 4 1/3 per cent.

                  The late Auditor of this State, in a published letter, stated that the revenue
                    derived from National Banks in this State amounted to a sum equal to the
                    ordinaty expenses of the State government.

                  The official records show that about one-nineteenth of all the tax flowing into
                    the treasury of Marion County is derived from the taxation of National Bank
                    stock.

                  It will thus be seen, by facts which cannot be controverted, that National Bank
                    stock now pays a larger aggregate tax than other property in the State.

                  One reason for this is because it is assessed in a different manner, being
                    never returned for taxable purposes at less than par, whereas real estate, and
                    other property, will not, probably, average above one-half its real value; and
                    another reason is that it pays a higher tax to the General Government.

                  It is true it does not pay a municipal tax. Neither did the old State Bank, nor
                    the present Bank of the State; so it will be seen that the history of the State
                    has been uniform upon the subject for nearly forty years.

                  There are some strong reasons why this exemption is not unjust, only a few of
                    which can be presented within the limits of this report: Capital is the life
                    blood of commerce and man- 
                
              
            

            
            

            

            opposed to making any contract throughout the whole progress in this matter. I say in
              this there was no contract but that the vote simply was an expression of individual
              Senators-those who voted in the affirmative may be pledged, but I voted "no"
              and am not pledged on this question. I vote "no."

            Mr. SCOTT, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said: I vote to lay
              this motion on the table because. I think the matter is well understood that it shall
              lay there till next Friday. I do it as the shortest way to get at the motion I made
              myself. I vote "aye."

            Mr. GRAY having now desired that his name be called, said: I want to say in
              explanation that I shall vote to lay upon the table for the following reasons:
              Yesterday a half a million of dollars was voted out of the pockets of the people; the
              Specific appropriation bill has not passed, the gravel road bill has not passed, the
              fee and salary bill has not passed-and every measure in which the people are
              interested has not be acted upon; and as long as the interests of the people are
              neglected and nothing is done but to get money out of the Treasury, I will vote to put
              this question off till the end of the session.

            So the proposition to take up the Constitutional Amendment question was laid on the
              table.

            The amendment [Mr. Craven's] was also laid on the table.

            The motion to take up the bill [H. R. 113[ to
              render taxation for common school purposes uniform and provide for the education of
              colored children of the State was agreed to.

            
              EDUCATION OF COLORED CHILDREN.

              Mr. HADLEY demanded the previous question.

              The Senate seconded the demand.

              Under the pressure of the previous question, the bill was read the thire time and
                passed by yeas 33, nays 9-as follows:

              
                
                  
                    YEAS-Messrs. Andrews, Beardsley, Bellamy, Bradley, Case,
                      Caven, Church, Cravens, Elicit, Fisher, Fosdick, Gifford, Gray, Green, Hadley,
                      Hamilton, Hess, Hooper, Huey, Huffman, Jaquess,Johnson of Spencer, Kinley,
                      Laselle, Morgan, Rice, Reynolds, Robinson of Madison, Robinson of Decatur,
                      Scott, Stein, Wollcott and Wood-33.

                    NAYS-Messrs. Bird, Carson, Henderson, Humphreys, Lee,
                      Montgomery, Sherrod, Taggart and Turner-9.
                  
                
              

              Pending the roll call-

              Mr. BRADLEY in explanation of his vote, when his name was called said: I dislike to
                vote against this bill and vote "aye" with great reluctance.

              Mr. CARSON, when his name was called, was understood to say, in explanation of his
                vote, that he would not vote to tax himself for the purposes set forth in the bill
                and therefore would vote "no."

              Mr. CHURCH, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called said: I understand
                this gives the negro a little more than equal, according to the Senator from Alien,
                [Mr. Carson,] but still I shall vote in favor of the bill. "Aye."

              Mr. GRAY, when his name was called said: This is not such a bill as I should like
                to vote for, but it is one step in the right direction. I believe this law will fall
                before the courts of the country, but being one step in right the direction I vote
                "aye."

              Mr. JOHNSON of Spencer, when his name was called said: I have come to the
                conclusion that in all human probability, the negroes will be voters next year, and
                being in hopes that they may be qualified to vote properly I vote
                "aye."

              Mr. KINLEY, when his name was called said: I have serious doubts as to the
                propriety of passing this bill for the reason that I believe the Constitution
                already gives the negroes more rights than this bill, but I have decided to give the
                friends of the bill the benefits of these doubts. I vote "aye."

              Mr. SCOTT, when his name was called said: I want to say in explanation, that I am
                very sorry the item for taxing the poll has been left out. It is an oversight I am
                satisfied. I vote "aye."

              The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR then announced the vote as above.

              So the bill passed.

             Education of Colored Children,----Fifteenth Amendment to the
              Constitution of the United States,
            IN SENATE.
            
              WEDNESDAY, May 12, 1869.
            
            [IN CONTINUATION-p. 213. FIRST
                COLUMN.]

             Mr. SCOTT moved to take up the bill, [H. R.
                113.] A bill to render taxation for common school purposes uniform, and to
              provide for the education of the colored children of the State.

            Mr. CRAVENS moved to amend by inserting the Specific Appropriation bill [H. R. 311.] 

            Mr. STEIN moved to substitute the Constitutional Amendment.

            Mr. BALLAMY moved to lay these amendments on the table.

            Mr. WOLCOTT demanded a division of the question.

            The substitute [Mr. Stein's] was laid on the table by yeas 32, nays 10as
              follows:

            
              
                
                  YEAS - Messrs. Audrews, Bellamy, Bird, Bradley, Carson,
                    Case, CaAen, Church, Denbo, Elliott, Fosdick, Gifford, Gray, Hadley,
                    Hanna, Henderson, Huey, Huffman, Humphreys, Jaquess, Johnson of Spencer,
                    Laselle, Lee, Montgomery, Morgan, Rice, Robinson of Decature, Scott, Sherrod,
                    Taggart, Wolcott and Wood - 32.

                  NAYS-Messrs. Beardsley, Cravens, Fisher, Green, Hamilton,
                    Hess, Hooper, Kinley, Reynolds and Stein-10.
                
              
            

            Pending the roll call-

            Mr. CRAVENS said he would vote "no" for the reason that the Senate has
              already taken up the Constitutional Amendment question and postponed it.

            Mr. FISHER when his name was called, in explanation of his vote said: I shall vote
              against laying the Constitutional Amendment question on the table and in favor of
              taking it up with the view of moving for its postponement till Friday. I know it is
              neccessary after the resolution adopted the other day that we should take up this
              question, for it is not now postponed till Friday. I vote "no."

            Mr. FOSDICK in explanation of his vote, when his name was called said: I see no
              necessity for taking this up and postponing it till Friday. It is generally understood
              by the majority that there is an agreement to postpone it, and it as lies on the table
              it can be taken up Friday as well as to-day, and for that reason I vote to lay on the
              table. I vote "aye."

            Mr. GIFFORD, when his name was called, said: For the same reason I vote
              "aye."

            Mr. HAMILTON, when his name was called, said: I voted by yeas and nays pledging
              myself to defer the consideration of this question till Friday, and I want it
              distinctly understood that I vote against laying it on the table with a view of
              carrying out our arrangement.

            Mr. HOOPER, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called said: I desire to
              say in explanation that I do not consider that there is a contract out here by which
              there is an agreement to postpone this subject to a given day. I know it is true that
              at a certain caucus it was concluded that they would postpone it, but there was no
              contract or agreement-it was our own voluntary action.

            Mr. FISHER (interposing.) I predicated the contract upon the fact that the Senate has
              passed a resolution to that effect.

            Mr. HAMILTON (in his seat.) Under the yeas and nays.

            Mr. HOOPER. That I apprehend to be binding only upon those who voted in the
              affirmative. I consider myself at liberty to vote to take it up at any time. I have
              been 

            
            

            
              
                
                  
                   ufactures, and it is these that make the prosperity of a city. The true policy
                    is to offer every inducement to bring capital from other points, for can it be
                    doubted that its influence in building up manufactures and promoting commerce
                    and business is of far more value than the exercise of the right to tax it for
                    municipal purposes?

                  In point of fact a large portion of the stock in our Banks is owned by persons
                    who do not jive in the city where the Bank is situated. Take Indianapolis as
                    an'example: There are in two Banks alone $350,000 of stock owned by persons
                    who live in the counties of Delaware, Dearborn, Shelby, Jefferson, Scott, Clark,
                    Washington, Knox, and elsewhere outside of the corporation of Indianapolis.

                  Now this stock is personal property, and instead of being taxed where the
                    stockholder lives, like other personal property, it is all now taxed for State,
                    county, school and township purposes Li Marion county, and all goes into the
                    treasury of that county and for her exclusive benefit.

                  Not being satisfied with making these nonresident stockholders pay tribute to
                    Marion county and to the schools of Indianapolis, it is now proposed to go a
                    step further, and make them pay such additional sums as may suit the whims and
                    caprices of the Common Council of the city. This Council can levy taxes for a
                    thousand purposes which the owners of houses and lots can well afford to pay,
                    because the expenditure of the money for city improvements may greatly add to
                    the value of their properly, but will it, to the same extent, if at all, add to
                    the value of naked capital invested in a National Bank, especially by a
                    non-resident?

                  Is the mere protection of the fire department and police not more than
                    compensated by the benefit which the use of the capital is to the business of
                    the city, and especially when it is considered that the Banks have, at their own
                    expense, provided against fires by procuring fireproof vaults and safes, and in
                    many instances, as in Indianapolis, employ and pay their own police? Besides,
                    tax is now paid, under the present law, upon all the stock of the Banks, no
                    matter where the stockholder lives, to build school houses and support schools
                    in the city where the Bank is situated.

                  But even admitting it to be right and proper for incorporated cities and towns
                    to levy a tax upon the shares of National Bank stock for mere municipal
                    purposes, the grave and vital question remains to be considered whether the
                    Constitution and laws do not preclude it from being done in this State.

                  The Fourth Section of the Eleventh Article of our Constitution authorises the
                    General Assembly to establish a Bank, with branches.

                  By virtue of this authority the General Assembly, on the 3d day of March, 1855,
                    chartered a Bank for twenty years from the date of its organization, with an
                    express provision that said Charter should not be altered or amended without the
                    consent of the President and directors of said Bank. - See Sec. XCI.

                  The 15th Section of this Bank Charter reads as follows:

                  The Capital Stock of said Bank shall be subject to the same rate of taxation
                    for State and County purposes as the property or stock of other monied
                    corporations, and the real estate and other property of said Bank and branches
                    situated in any city or town shall be taxable for municipal purposes in the same
                    manner as other property so situated, but the Capital Stock of said Bank or
                    Branches shall not be taxable for municipal purposes.

                  And the latter clause of this Section, that "the Capital Stock of said
                    Bank and brandies shall not be taxed for municipal purposes," has been
                    declared to be constitutional by the Supreme Court of Indiana, in several
                    cases.-11 Ind., 139.-16 Ind., 105.17-Ind., 48.

                  The Act of Congress creating National Banks authorizes their taxation under
                    State laws, but with an express provision

                  That the tax so imposed under the laws of any State upon the Shares of any of
                    the associations authorized by this Act shall not exceed the rate imposed upon
                    the shares in any of the Banks organized under the authority of the State where
                    such association is located.

                  It follows clearly that if the State cannot authorize the taxation of the Stock
                    of the Bank of the State for municipal purposes, it cannot tax the Stock of
                    National Banks. It is evident that the object of Congress was to place National
                    Banks upon a footing as favorable in relation to taxation "as any of the
                    Banks organized under the authority of the State where such association is
                    located." This language is too plain to admit of any question. If it is not
                    right it is the fault of Congress, and Congress can apply the remedy by
                    repealing the restriction.

                  The Bank of the State having a legal existence under its Charter, which Charter
                    forbids taxation for municipal purposes, and no change of said Charter having
                    been consented to by its President and Directors, it follows that this
                    Legislature has no power to impose municipal taxation upon its Stock, nor has it
                    any power to impose such tax upon the shares of National Bank stock, for the
                    reasons already stated.

                  The Committee therefore report back the bill, with recommendation that it do
                    not pass.

                        SCOTT.
                  
                
              
            

            Mr. HANNA in behalf of himself and Mr. Howk, submitted the following supplemental
              report: 

            

            
              
                
                  

                  
                    Mr. PRESIDENT:
                  
                   The undersigned would state that two questions present themselves upon all
                    propositions submitted to a Legislative body for action.

                  First. As to the authority to legislate in the manner asked upon the given
                    subject.

                  Second. Conceding the authority, then as to the policy or impolicy of the
                    exercise of that right.

                  The Charter of the Bank of the State is peculiar in this; that it provides sec.
                    79, that "the capital stock of the Bank and branches shall be divided into
                    shares of fifty dollars each" and then in the 15th section: "That the
                    real and personal property but not the capital stock, shall be subject to
                    assessment for city purposes." How can a distinction in this particular
                    instance be drawn between the share and capital stock. That distinction must be
                    drawn as to this Charter or else an official decision of the highest courts
                    running through many years must provide to exempt the taxation of the shares of
                    capital stock of the Bank of the State for city purposes. As the law of Congress
                    under which the National Banks were organized prohibits the State from
                    discriminating in taxation against such Banks; that is in levying taxes upon
                    them, which cannot under the laws of the State be levied upon State Banks, it
                    would seem to follow that the remedy is with Congress in reforming the laws of
                    the States upon that point.

                  As this first question meets us in this shape at the threshhold it is clearly
                    unnecessary for us to discuss the second; and we have not therefore examined as
                    to the questions discussed by the Committee on that point. It is needless for
                    the undersigned to say what their views are upon the abstract question of
                    equality of taxation of all kinds of property. We suppose it is well known, and
                    in joining in the majority report we did so solely with the reference to the
                    legal question involved.
                  
                    Signed 
                    J. M. HANNA, G. V. HOWK.
                  
                
                
              
            

            Mr. CAVIN, as the minority of the Judiciary Committee, submitted
              the following report:

            
              
                
                  
                  Mr. PRESIDENT: The undersigned a minority of the Judicial
                      Committee to whom was referred House Bill No. 170, viz:

                  A bill "to provide for the assessment and collection of taxes for
                    mnnicipal purposes on the shares of stock owned in Banks and Banking
                    associations doing business in this State," has given the same the best
                    consideration he could in the short time permitted and now respectfully submits
                    this minority report.

                  The bill proposes "Sec. 1. That the Shares of Capital Stock owned or held
                    by any person or body corporate, in any Bank or Banking Association chartered or
                    organized. &c., under the laws of this State or of the United States,
                    (including the Bank of the State of Indiana and its several branches and
                    National Banks,&c., shall be taxed &c., for municipal purposes,"
                    &c.

                  The object is to subject National Bank Stock to city taxation.

                  To render property liable to taxation requires affirmative legislation-that the
                    power be conferred by the Constitution or laws. This affirmative provision is to
                    be found in our Constitution, sec. 1 art. 10:

                  The General Assembly shall provide by law for a uniform and equal rate of
                    assessment and taxation and shall prescribe such regulations as shall secure a
                    just valuation for taxation of all property both real and personal excepting
                    such only for municipal, educational, literary, scientific, religious or
                    charitable purposes as may be especially exempted by law. 

                  No property then under this section is exempt from taxation, miles the
                    Legislature has failed to provide a uniform and equal rate of taxation, or else
                    falling within some of the Constitutional exceptions. In addition a law has been
                    enacted specially exempting it Or unless some other section of the Constitution
                    authorizes it.

                  The National Banks claim that their stock is not taxable for municipal purposes
                    and to make good the claim as it clearly does not fall within the permitted
                    exemptions of section 1, article 10, it must be shown that some other clause in
                    the Constitution permits it, or else that the Legislature has not provided for
                    their taxation.

                  In the act of Congress (National Bank law) approved June 3, 1864, in Sec. 41,
                    it is enacted as follows: "Provided further, That the tax so imposed under
                    the laws of any State upon the shares of any of the Associations authorized by
                    this act, shall not exceed the rate imposed upon the shares in any of the Banks
                    organized under authority of the State where such Association is
                    located."

                  The Act Chartering the State Bank which passed both Houset of the General
                    Assembly March 3, 1855, over the Governor's veto, sec. 1, G. & H. p.
                    142, contains the following provision: "Sec. 15. The Capital Stock of said
                    Bank shall be subject to the same rate of taxation for State and county purposes
                    as the property or stock of other monied corporations, and the real estate and
                    other property of said Bank and branches situated in any city or town shall be
                    taxable for municipal purposes in the same manner as other property so situated;
                    but the Capital Stock of said Bank or branches shall not be taxable for
                    municipal purposes."

                  As the question whether the National Bank Stocks can be taxed finally hinges
                    upon the force and Constitutionality of this section it will become necessary to
                    examine the decisions upon the subject.

                  Sec. 1, Art. 10 has already been recited and  requires first in hard and general terms that the
                    General Assembly shall provide for a uniform and equal rate of assessment and
                    taxation and then permits certain exceptions.

                  Although the State Banks do not fall within these exceptions and although the
                    Legislature has not assumed to "specially exempt" them, as such
                    exceptions, yet Sec. 15, of the Bank law does specially exempt them and the
                    Supreme Court as reported in 11th Indiana p. 139, decide that sec. 15. is
                    Constitutional and does prevent cities from taxing the Capital Stock of State
                    Banks-that the Constitution expressly authorized the Legislature to Charter a
                    Bank with branches and that such a grant unqualified carried with it the power
                    to fix the conditions upon and under which the corporations might exist and that
                    one of these conditions might be an enlargement or curtailment of the right to
                    tax and that the power to make such grant or charter by the Legislature of
                    Indiana was only controlled by the express limitations of the Constitution and
                    that although there were limitations, yet there were none upon the power of
                    taxation, and hence that subject was under the unlimited control of the
                    Legislature and was independent of sec. 1, art. 10; and hence the Legislature
                    might by the charter have relieved the State Banks of all taxation even for
                    State and county purposes, or might have taxed them more than other property -
                    that their existence being authorized as a special and independent creature of
                    another clause of the Constitution and that they do not come under the rule of
                    uniformity and equality and the Court go further and decide that sec. 1, art,
                    10; does not refer to municipal taxation so that the Legislature might exempt
                    any property from municipal taxation and the Court refers to the fact that the
                    Constitution of 1816, authorized the Legislature to Charter State Banks, and
                    that such a charter was granted Jan. 20, 1834, and that sec. 15 of that Charter,
                    and sec. 5, of an amendment thereto, of Feb. 6, 1841, made certain exemptions
                    from taxation and that the Supreme Court in 7th Black, 393 and 395, and 6 Black.
                    349 and 3 Ind. 43, had decided that these exemptions were valid but it should be
                    remembered that the Constitution of 1816, did not contain the clause requiring
                    uniform and equal taxation contained in that of 1851, and that in the decisions
                    refered to no constitutional question was discussed or decided.

                  A later decision, however, in 27 Ind. p. 223 decides that "this section of
                    the Constitution, (viz. sec. 1, art. 10,) is applicable to and furnishes the
                    governing principles for all laws authorizing taxes to be levied either for
                    State, county, township or corporation purposes: in effect, annulling 11 Ind.
                    139 on this point. This would bring municipal taxation under the provision of
                    art 10, and would settle the question that sec. 15 of the Bank law, and thus
                    remove the only obstacle to municipal taxation of Bank stocks; but a later
                    decision 27 Ind p. 333, does not seem to recognize the decision on page 223 as
                    going so far. 

                  In 23 Ind. p. 331, is a decision that the city of Madison could not tax the
                    capital stock of a Bank organized under the General Banking Law of 1852, bat
                    upon a different ground, viz: that United States Bonds could not be taxed and
                    that as the "capital stock" consisted of these bonds, therefore the
                    capital stock could not be taxed.

                  This decision has also been annulled, 27 Ind. 341, and by the United States
                    Supreme Court in two cases in which it is decided "that a tax upon the
                    shares is not a tax upon the property belonging to the corporation," and in
                    the same volume p. 338 it is decided that "The shares of National Banks
                    are, by the act of Congress authorizing such associations placed within the
                    taxing power of the States." But that "under existing laws the shares
                    of National Banks cannot be taxed in this State because no such tax is imposed
                    upon the shares of Banks organized under authority of the State." So that
                    the reason they could not be taxed for State and county purposes was not the
                    absence of power to tax them, but because the Legislature had failed to provide
                    by law for their taxation: and in 27th Ind. p. 332 involing the exact question
                    of the power of a city to tax a stockholder upon his shares of stock, the Court
                    says: "That the question whether sec. 15, of the State Bank law was in
                    violation of sec. 1, art. 10, of the Constitution had not been fully argued
                    before them, and that upon it the Judges had not reached a united conclustion
                    and that it was probable from the reasoning in the case in 11 Ind. p. 139,
                    deciding it Constitutional that it had not been thoroughly considered and
                    prefered to express no opinion as the case could be decided upon another point,
                    showing that the Court did not consider the Constitutional question even as to
                    cities settled by that case, but discredit the reasoning and treat the question
                    as yet open and decide the case upon the ground that the city of Indianapolis
                    could not tax National Bank shares because the city charter of 1865 did not
                    authorize taxing stock of State Banks. Not deciding that the Legislature had no
                    power to tax but that it had not been exercised and for that reason decline to
                    decide the Constitutional question and hence without such affirmative
                    legislation no decision upon the Constitutional question can be obtained.

                  We find then that the State Bank law exempted the capital stock of State Banks
                    from municipal taxation and a decision of the Supreme Court that such exemptiom
                    is Constitutional.

                  

                  That the same Court has decided that the Constitutional provision of uniformity
                    and equality does not apply to municipal but only to State and county
                    taxation.

                  The same Court has also decided that to tax an individual upon his shares of
                    stock was a tax upon so much of the capital stock and hence prohibited by sec.
                    41 of act of Congress.

                  We find the decision that the 15 section was Constitutional and also that it
                    did not apply to cities doubted and shaken.

                  That the shares of National Banks are within the reach of State taxation.

                  That a tax upon the share of an individual assessed against him is not a tax
                    upon the property of the Bank.

                  These recent decisions very much qualify the former and advance far on the road
                    to recognizing the power of the Legislature to authorize cities to tax the
                    stockholder on his shares but in order to do so to test the question finally,
                    further legislation is necessary.

                  The Charter to the Bank is a grant of exclusive and beneficial privileges-it is
                    true it is a vested franchise and such grants are even termed contracts binding
                    upon the grantor as well as upon the grantee, yet being peculiarly a benefit to
                    the grantee-an exclusive privilege and may be forfeited. One of the modes of
                    forfeiture is by non-user.

                  The National Bank law of 1863, sec. 61, p. 681, as also that of 1864, sec. 44,
                    p. 118, authorized any Bank authorized by law in any State to accept the
                    provisions of the law and become a National Bank.

                  These provisions were voluntarily accepted by all the State Banks and they
                    became National Banks; still with valuable and exclusive privileges and the
                    State Banks practically ceased to exist.

                  The Bank Charter required the State Bank to keep an office at Indianapolis, and
                    that the Directors should meet once in three months, and then invested them with
                    the necessary powers, and contemplated that they should conduct an active
                    banking business-to loan money, buy, sell and negotiate bills of exchange, to
                    "discount notes, and issue and put in circulation bank bills, &c.

                  But for several years none of these Banks have conducted a banking business as
                    contemplated, and whether they have quarterly and annual meetings of the
                    Directors we do not know, or if reports are made to the Legislature as required,
                    but if these things are done it is merely nominal, and the stock has but a
                    nominal existence, the National Bank stock, having been issued therefor. There
                    is no such one of the powers granted as was contemplated by the Legislature when
                    the Charter was granted.

                  As it is true that the grant of some general power carries with it such implied
                    powers as are necessary to the execution of such general power; so it is equally
                    true that to cease to exercise the general power for which a corporation was
                    created is such a non-user as carries with it a forfeiture of all the lesser and
                    incidental powers though expressed, and there has been for years such a
                    voluntary non-user of the general power of the State Banks such an abandonment
                    of all its main and supposed beneficial purposes as amounts to a non-user, and
                    it cannot be that some incidental and subordinate grant having only a purpose in
                    the exercise of the main grant and one too which even in that connection, but
                    more so standing alone is against public policy and common right should survive
                    the main purpose merely as an obstacle to important legislation.

                  The object of sec. 15 was to protect State Bank stock from municipal taxation
                    or to be exempt. There is no such stock now to tax and hence the law can no
                    longer serve the purpose for which it was intended, and when that on which the
                    law was intended to operate ceases to be, when the reason of the law ceases the
                    law ceases also.

                  If it was only a franchise held at the favor of the State, then the State has
                    power to revoke it, and if it was a contract for which there was a
                    consideration, that consideration was that they should perform the functions of
                    banks the functions prescribed in their charter, and this they have ceased to do
                    and they cannot insist upon the continuance of a contract which they have
                    broken, or claim that the State is still bound on her part, while they
                    continually utterly fail in performance, on their part; they cannot abandon all
                    that was beneficial to the public and retain only that which was injurious.

                  As a non-user cannot be made available in any collateral proceeding, some
                    action, either by legislation or by a court upon a writ of quo warranto to declare a forfeiture will be
                    neccessary, for so long as the State, the other party to the contract or the
                    grantor of the franchise is content to overlook the violation the charter still
                    stands and the non-user could not be pleaded in any collateral proceeding.

                  It is no doubt competent for the Legislature the other party to the violated
                    contract, or the sovereign grantor of a perverted franchise to recind such
                    contract or revoke such franchise. The conditions are at least mutual and
                    reciprocal and a violation by the one party is cause for release of the other if
                    electing to assert it and hence the Legislature having enacted this law and the
                    Banks accepted it, when the Banks by non-user abandon and reject it the
                    Legislature may repeal the law.

                  From the fact then that exemptions from taxation are against common right and
                    public policy-that at this time taxation is extremely  heavy, and laws exempting from taxation should be
                    strictly construed, and that the original exemption was of doubtful
                    Constitutionality; for although former decisions seem to-sustain, it yet later
                    decisions throw doubt on the former; and as the law is now subserving a purpose
                    not at all originally contempated and as the Banks on their part, have abandoned
                    their charter, in so far as it could be useful to the public and as the decision
                    of the Supreme Court leave the Constitutional question undecided and as that
                    question cannot be finally tested without some legislation; therefore the
                    undersigned a minority of said Commttee recommend the adoption of a preamble to
                    the present bill reciting the fact of non-user and then amend by repealing the
                    State Bank law and when so amended which amendments are presented herewith,
                    recommend the passage of the bill.

                  
                    J. CAVEN, Minority Committee.
                  
                
              
            


             Mr. HANNA moved to make the subject the special order for two o'clock to-day in
                Committee of the Whole.

            Mr. GRAY preferred its consideration at onee and now.

            Mr. GREEN was of the opinion if the Senate went into Committee of the
                Whole this would close up all Legislation for this session.

            Mr. CRAVENS did not propose to contribute to dodging the result of the consideration
              of the Constitutional Amendment, and as much business of importance was before us, he
              moved to indefinitely postpone the bill.

            Mr. MORGAN declared there was now eleven millions of dollars in the hands of the
              wealthy men escaping taxation for municipal purposes, and he regarded it as important
              a measure as is before this Legislature, consequently it should be acted on now.

            Mr. GRAY did not understand that any rule required this bill to be discussed in the
                Committee of the Whole, as is contended by the Senator from
              Sullivan [Mr. Hanna] and others.

            Mr. CHURCH undertook to say the country districts did not demand that this measure
              should be passed. He was not disposed to lay aside the important legislation of this
              session for the consideration of this bill.

            Mr. GRAY showed the invidious distinction made by the present law, as between
              investments in Bank stocks and investments in the mercantile business, and declared
              that this bill would remedy it. The question of justice is the most important one to
              be discussed and acted upon in any legislative body, and this bill should claim
              immediate attention by the Senate.

            Mr. CARSON also regarded this as a very important measure. He regarded this bill as
              one called for by one hundred thousand people of Indiana, and recommended by the chief
              Executive officer of the State in his message to the Legislature.

            Mr. CRAVENS made his motion not to avoid a decision by the Senate, for he felt
              convinced this matter would have to be adjudicated by the courts, and it could be sent
              to the courts as well without the bill as with it. He demanded the previous
              question.

            The Senate seconded the demand.

            The motion to indefinitely postpone the bill was then agreed to by yeas 25, nays
              21-as follows:

            Pending the roll call-

            Mr. FISHER, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote said: It has always
              been contended by the Democratic party that the consumer paid the taxes, and it was
              conceded by the other party. I apprehend the same rule will apply to Banks. If we levy
              a tax upon the Banks they will increase their rate of interest, and the borrowers will
              pay the excess; and the borrowers will pay a diminished price for produce in
              consequence of the increased interest they pay; and thus the farmer of the country
              support indirectly the municipal expenses of the country. I vote
              "aye."'

            Mr. GRAY, when his name was called said: If the theory of the Senator from Wabash,
              [Mr. Fisher.] is correct you should take the tax off of every thing, and thereby
              reduce the expenses of the farmer, and we would have no revenue for the government at
              all. I vote "no."

            Mr. GREEN, when his name was called, said: I do not wish to make any explanation, for
              I have already made my speech on this subject the other session. I vote "no"
              believing the vote I give will determine the question, and I want the friends of the
              measure to vote in the negative and that will settle the question. I vote
              "no."

            Mr. KINLEY, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called said: The
              Constitution provides that taxation shall be equal and natural justice demands that it
              shall be equal, therefore I vote "no."

            Mr. MORGAN, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote said: I have taken
              an oath to support the Constitutton of the 
                *The Secretary's journal is wrong in recording Mr.
                Denbo among the yeas on this vote. He voted "no" on this
                question. State, and as I believe there
              can be no taxes collected except by authority of law, and I am sent here for the
              purpose of helping to make the laws; and as Banks when they pay no tax at all except
              an income tax charge from twelve to eighteen per cent, for discounting, and afterwards
              when they had to pay a tax of four and one third per cent., according to the written
              Bank account, they put down their discounts at ten per cent. I think it an advantage
              to tax them and it would be doing them a great injustice to have the matter postponed.
              I vote "no."

            Mr. WOLCOTT, when his name was called, in explanation said: It is impossible to
              discuss this question of postponment at this stage, without discussing the merits of
              the bill, because it is of that nature, that its merits alone, or its demerits are the
              reasons for a vote upon this question. I apprehend the friends of postment must be
              laboring under a misapprehension of the facts if their statements are honestly made.
              They claim that National Banks are paying taxes exceeding that of other property. They
              don't offsett the peculiar advantages which render this no tax at all, but which
              makes the property of National Banks worth more than the property held by any other
              persons in community. They are authorized on the deposit of bonds to receive ninety
              per cent, of the deposit in circulation. Take a bank which deposits one hundred
              thousand dollars in bonds; upon that deposit they receive six per cent, interest in
              coin, which is worth about eight in currency, then they receive ninety per cent, in
              circulation which is money to them. In other words the one hundred thousand dollars
              they have deposited pays 98 per cent, in fact and that makes a net profit of seven per
              cent, they get on circulation and securities or bonds. That is two and two thirds per
              cent, more than the tax they pay. So they have property above taxation which is worth
              two and two thirds per cent.

            Then the National Banks are the Depositories of the public monies. In all collection
              districts the money belonging to the United States goes into them, and upon these
              deposits the Banks pay no interest. This is money they lend; and it is a valuable
              privilege they enjoy, worth in addition to the two and two-thirds per cent above the
              taxes at least two or three per cent more. Then there is a little fallacy in what is
              called "taxes." What is taxed on circulation is simply a reinbursement to
              the government, the cost of printing and furnishing their circulation. It is no tax at
              all, but simply a charge upon their own business. Then there is a fallacy in reference
              to this subject of residence. They said this:

            "Now this stock is personal property, and instead of being taxed where the
              stockholder lives, like other personal property, it is all now taxed for State,
              county, school and township purposes in Marion county, and all goes into the treasury
              of that county and for her exclusive benefit."

            This is not a full statement. What do they mean? The farmer who resides income other
              part of the State or outside of the State owning stock in a bank in this city has to
              pay taxes here--

            Mr. RICE (interposing.) Mr, President: other Senators have not had the privilege of
              going into the argument of this question The gentleman has certainly exceeded the
              limits allowed heretofore.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. The Chair has decided that speakers must confine themselves
              during the call of the yeas and nays, to the reasons which influence their votes; but
              it is impossible for the Chair to say exactly what latitude a Senator will be allowed.
              I think the Senator from white [Mr. Wolcott] has gone to the limit, at least, of the
              latitude allowed in a discussion at this point. Still the Chair does not feel disposed
              to rule it out of order.

            Mr. RICE. Then the gentleman's time is out.

            Mr. WOLCOTT (continuing.) It is stated that farmers have certificates in the country
              representing property here which consist in money, in discounted personal notes and in
              the various forms of assets which constitues the capital of a bank; and here it should
              pay taxes like other property. The farmer's property is not with him in the
              country. There is an entire fallacy on that subject. National Banks in other States
              are not exempt from municipal taxation and it is not deemed a burden or oppression. No
              Banks throw up their organization, and I think there is not a single bank in the State
              whose stock is not at a large premium. I vote "no."

            Mr. WOOD, when his name was called said: Without giving any other reason which
              controls my vote I will give one. I am going to cast my vote for the best interests of
              the people I represent. Most of the Bank stock in my district is owned by parties
              living outside of the cities, and if I vote for this bill and it becomes a law I
              simply vote that they shall help sustain a municipality which they have no interest
              whatever in. I vote "aye."

            Mr. HANNA now requesting his name to be called said: Mr. Presient, I am informed that
              the tally shows that there are not twenty-six votes against the indefinite
              postponement. If that is so it is evident that this bill can't be passed and
              therefore to vote against indefinite postponement and go into Committee of the Whole
              would be to waste the balance of the day in useless discussion. I am anxious to have
              the business of the session transacted. I  have
              given my reasons on this subject, as a lawyer, in the report I made. I am trammelled
              as a lawyer and as a sworn judge. The seventy-ninth section of the peculiar charter of
              our State Bank says that the stock shall be divided into shares of fifty dollars each;
              the fifteenth section says that the capital stock shall not be taxable for municipal
              purposes and the Supreme Court has uniformly held that charter Constitutional. They
              had this question before them in XXVIIth Ind. and refused to decide
              it-they evaded the question Without they decide that charter unconstitutional they
              could not with this law before them, get at the question of taxing them. As it is
              manifest there is not sufficient strength to pass this bill even after discussing it
              the whole of this day, it seems to me it is my duty, looking to the interests of the
              people to vote in favor of the indefinite postponement of this measure. I vote
              "aye."

            Mr. JAQUESS, also desiring his name called again, was understood to say, that as time
              was precious he too would vote "aye."

            Mr. SHERROD, also haing his name called again said: I wish to change my vote for the
              reasons given by the Senator from Suliivan [Mr. Hanna.] It is evident that this bill
              can not get the necessary Constitutional vote to pass it. It is therefore a waste of
              time to discuss it, and especially at this late hour of the session, when there are so
              many measures waiting the action of the Senate in which the people are directly
              interested. I shall therefore vote for the indefinite postponement. I vote
              "aye."

            Mr. GIFFORD, also had his name called again, and said: For the same reason I change
              my vote. "Aye."

            Mr. ANDREWS, also had his name called again, and said: I will change my vote for the
              same reasons. I vote "aye."

            Mr. WOLCOTT, also had his name called again, and said: I will change my vote for the
              purpose of moving a reconsideration. I vote "aye."

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR then announced the vote as above recorded.

            So the motion to indefinitely postpone the bill was agreed to.

            Mr. WOLCOTT now moved to reconsider the vote just taken.

            Mr. CHURCH moved to lay this motion on the table.

            Mr. GRAY demanded a call of the Senate.

            It was ordered and being taken

            The Secretary reported forty-five members as present and answering to their
              names.

            Mr. BELLAMY moved to dispense with further proceedings under the call.

            The motion was agreed to by yeas 39, nays 6.

            The motion to lay the motion to reconsider on the table was then agreed to by yeas

            Pending the roll call-

            Mr. BRADLEY in explanation of his vote, when his name was called said: While I would
              be glad to tax Bank stock for municipal purposes, yet under the laws I am convinced we
              have no power to do it; therefore I am compelled to vote "aye."

            Mr. GRAY, when his name was called said: This bill has been fought bitterly ever
              since it came before the Senate. It was taken to the Judiciary
                Committee and kept there; a printed report was brought out; they attempted
              to get the previous question on it; then the vote came on the indefinite postponement
              and before the vote was announced from the desk it was stated that 26 votes were not
              cast against it, I vote "no."

            Mr. LASSELLE, in explanation of his vote when his name was called said: I vote
              "no" because I like to see a square vote on the question. I believe we have
              a right to tax the shares of Bank stock for municipal and other purposes because the
              Constitution says taxation shall be uniform and equal.

            Mr. MORGAN, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote said: There seems to
              be a determination to get rid of this question without getting upon the record; and
              ingenuity and everything else is brought to bear upon it to get rid of it. I want to
              record myself as being opposed to any postponement of the matter. I want to have the
              question come up square and fair. The bill is decided by lawyers here to be
              unconstitutional. I give it as my opinion, and pledge myself as a lawyer-a
              constitutional lawyer-that it is constitutional. I vote "no.'

            Mr. TURNER, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called said: Two ballots
              lave shown that this bill cannot be passed. We have but about six hours remaining in
              which we can do legislative business this session; and I shall vote
              "aye."

            Mr WOLCOTT, when his name was called, said: I am of opinion that with a full and fair
              discussion this bill can pass; and regret that Senators favoring this bill vote as
              they have. I vote "no."

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR then announced the vote as above recorded-yeas 26, nays 20. 

            

            So the motion to reconsider the vote indefinitely postponing the Bank tax bill was
              laid on the table.

            
              CHAPMAN'S LIQUOR BILL.

              Mr. KINLEY moved to take up the bill [H. R. 288.] A bill to amend sections four and
                eight of the Liquor Law of March 5, 1859, that it may be read by title the second
                time, and the third time by sections.

              It proposes to amend the said section four by appropriately inserting these words:
                "And that he has filed in the office of the County Auditor the petition of a
                clear majority of the legal voters of the township, ward or voting precinct, as
                ascertained from the poll books of the last preceding election, verified by the oath
                or affirmation of the Township Trustee as to its correctness."

              It proposes to amend said section eight by excluding from sale "any person who
                is in the habit of becoming intoxicated," and adding these words: "And any
                person so licensed as above provided shall be at all times responsible for and
                liable in all cases of violation of the provisions of this act by any and all
                persons in his employ. Any person violating the provisions of this section as
                amended, shall be fined in any sum not less than ten dollars nor more than fffty
                dollars, and may be imprisoned for not less than ten nor more than thirty
                days."

              Mr. TURNER. Mr. President: I intend to vote against the passage of this bill but
                shall vote to have it brought up in order that the party opposed to me in politics
                which has pretended for the last ten years to be, and have obtained a large vote in
                this State on the ground that they were temperance men, when practically they were
                no more so than us who do not make any pretention-that these gentlemen may now have
                an opportunity of manifesting the truth of their pretensions.

              I make these remarks now because at the last end of the roll, where my name occurs,
                it would not be so well to make them. I want to try this thing on, and let the
                people see how this party, which gets ten or fifteen thousand votes on the ground
                that they are temperance men, goes on this question. I want to see if the people
                will aid them as well hereafter as they have heretofore on the strength of this
                temperance plea.

              The motion was agreed to and accordingly-

              The Temperance bill [H. R. 288] was read the second time by title and the third
                time by sections.

              The question being: "Shall the bill pass?"

              A constitutional provision requiring the yeas and nays, they were ordered and being
                taken resulted-yeas 22, nays 23-as follows:

              
                
                  
                    YEAS - Messrs, Andrews, Armstrong, Bellamy, Case, Church,
                      Cravens, Eliott, Fosdick, Gray,Green, Hadley, Hamilton, Hess, Hooper, Johnson
                      of Spencer, Kinley, Reynolds, Robinson of Madison, Robinson of Decatar, Scott,
                      Stein and Wood - 22

                    NAYS - Messrs. Beardsley, Bird, Bradley, Carson Caven,
                      Fisher, Gifford, Hanna, Henderson, Huey Huffman, Humphreys, Jaquess, Johnson
                      of Montgomery, Laselle, Lee, Montgomery, Morgan, Rice, Sherrod, Smith, Turner
                      and Wolcott - 23.
                  
                
              

              Pending the roll call

              Mr. BRADLEY, when his name was called said: I prefer that this bill should pass if
                it must without my vote. I vote "no." '

              Mr. CHURCH, in explanation of his vote when his name was called said: If I
                understand this bill it is Republican in character. It provides that if a majority
                of voters of any precinct desire the luxury and benefit of a whisky shop they can
                have it if they can find a man of a good moral character willing to engage in the
                business, and give a bond to the State for the protection of citizens. I am inclined
                to think a majority of the people ought to have this matter in their own hands: and
                I believe if a majority of the people declare whisky shops to be nuisances-and I
                believe such places are nuisances-it is time a majority of the people should speak
                upon this question and their voices should be heard. I believe if a majority of the
                people desire to have in their vicinity nuisances they ought to have them. And I
                believe so with reference to any thing else.

              This has ever been my opinion, but sometimes during my attendance on the
                Legislature I have voted contrary to my opinions giving my reasons for it. The
                reasons are: that the country has been engaged in a civil war, and in consequence of
                that I have thought it better to vote to postpone this question which might arouse
                other questions and the bearing might affect out country disastrously. I have
                endeavored to keep this question out of politics, but now we have the right and it
                is our duty to legislate on this subject. I vote "aye."

              Mr. FISHER when his name was called, in explanation of his vote said: Prior to the
                prohibitory law of 1855, I was an advcate of that law. I believed it was the most
                important thing the State Legislature could do, to pass such a law. This I think if
                carried out will be precisely the same as the prohibitory liquor law. The result of
                that was in effect to set back the progress of the cause of temperance some fifteen
                years in the State of Indiana. I do not believe the principle is as far advanced now
                as then.

              I believe if we pass this law it will remain upon the statute books no longer than
                the next session of the Legislature. I believe a Legislature will be elected here in
                two years that will repeal it and open the floodgates of intemperance wider than
                ever. I do not believe a majority of the people are in favor of this law. I vote
                "no." 

              

              Mr. GIFFORD, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called said: I represent
                Franklin County here and I know a majority of the voters there are against this law.
                I vote "no."

              Mr. GREEN, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called said: Ten years ago
                I spent the whole winter in getting up the present temperance law. At that time we
                had the Maine Liquor law men to fight and the liquor men of course, were opposing
                the passage of that law. We got it throngh and it operated as well as any law upon
                the subject. I think with proper enforcement of that law it is as stringent as the
                people will enforce, and at this time they have got a great temper anoe excitement
                in my district, and I would do violence to the feelings of the people there by
                voting against this bill, yet I think the bill objecfionable. I vote
                "aye."

              Mr. HAMILTON, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote said: It is
                scarcely necessary to state that I always have been in favor of temperance. If I
                vote against this bill I had better send home for my family and not go up there any
                more. If I have been beset by my people to ask for any thing here it has been for a
                law upon the liquor subject something such as is presented in this bill. It aint
                enough for me, but I am satisfied with what I can get. I vote "aye."

              Mr. HOOPER, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called said: I believe in
                the principle that the action of the majority on this question is perhaps as near
                correct as we can get. I realize the great difficulty of properly regulating this
                question. It is one of the matters almost impossible to determine. But while I must
                confess some doubts as to the advantages of this law over the present law whether it
                will accomplish the purpose its friends expect - I am willing to cast my doubt in
                the direction of correct public morals in the State. I vote "aye."

              Mr. JAQUESS, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called said: I believe I
                can say practically that I am as good a temperance man as any Senator here. But it
                is a plain case that our Democratic friends are seeking to gain political advantage
                out of this thing, and preferring to live under the rule of King Alcohol to living
                under the rule of the Democratic party I vote "no."

              Mr. JOHNSON, of Spencer, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote said:
                Two years ago I voted against the temperance bill for reasons not satisfactory at
                that time to the temperance party, nor were they satisfactory to the whisky sellers.
                This law refers the question to a majority of the people interested and there is
                where I believe it ought to be. I vote "aye."

              Mr. KINLEY, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote said: This bill
                does not contain all I should like; for it is well known to the Senate that I favor
                prohibition; but I think it a great improvement on the present law. One feature of
                the bill I wish to call attention to is that, as far as it operates, it throws the
                question of temperance out of politics and refers it to the people of the township,
                town or ward. I vote "aye."

              Mr. LASELLE, when his name was called, said in explanation of his vote: While I am
                in favor of a temperance law, I am not in favor of taxing any one business in the
                land higher than any other business. I think, sir, the present law is too stringent
                upon one class of persons, and therefore I am opposed to further restriction by the
                way of license. I vote "no."

              Mr. LEE, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called, said: For myself,
                Mr. President, I am in favor of this bill, but my constituents, I think, would not
                countenance me in voting for it. This liquor question has been one of the principal
                planks in their platform for many years, and I do not think they would like to have
                it knocked out at this late day. I vote "no."

              Mr. MORGAN, when his name was called, in explanation said: I claim to be as good a
                temperance man as any in the House. I helped form the first temperance society in
                the State in 1824, and I believe I helped form the first one at Evansville. I helped
                form the first lodge of the Sons of Temperance and I never was drunk in my life, and
                I don't want to be. The people in my section of the State are divided into two
                classes-Democrats and Republicans. The Democrats are the first class and the
                Republican class are those who sell whisky [A VOICE-"And the
                Democrats drink it"-Laughter]-they sell it wholesale and retail, and the
                Democrats sell beer. Now I look upon the thing as being morally wrong. I do not
                think it right for any man to sell whiskey or intoxicating liquors of any sort. I
                say it is morally wrong, and I say also that I am unwilling to go in partnership
                with any man to do the business. If it is wrong I say the State of Indiana has no
                right to go into partnership with the sellers and take part of their earnings. I say
                a prohibitory liquor law or none at all. I do not believe there can be any good done
                but by moral suasion. The more laws you make the worse you make the evil. For one I
                am opposed to all laws I vote "no."

              Mr. RICE, when his name was called in explanation of his vote said: It is a
                question to settle which is the best law. Believing as a friend of the Temperance
                cause, as I have believed for the last ten years, that the present liquor law if
                properly backed up and enforced by the temperance men and the moral  sentiment of the State is the best law on the subject we
                can get. I am satisfied to retain the law as it is. I have no confidence, and never
                had in prohibition. This is a prohibitory law for it requires a man, in order to
                obtain a license to get a majority of the legal voters to petition, and then
                requires the township Trustee to swear that he has obtained a majority. I say it is
                prohibitory in effect, and having no faith in any kind of a law that is not backed
                up by the moral force and determination of the temperance and moral party of the
                State-or in any law executing itself without the aid of that force, I, of course, go
                against prohibition. In our county we do it by moral suasion. The selling of whiskey
                is made so odius that the trafficker deserts it at once. I vote "no."

              Mr. ROBINSON of Madison, when his name was called, said: I vote "aye" and
                I don't care whether it pleases my constituents or not.

              Mr. SHERROD, in explanation of his vote when his name was called, said: I am
                opposed to all these innovations, I introduced a bill into the House several years
                ago to repeal the Main Liquor law. I do not believe you can legislate against a
                class of men in a certain business. I do not believe in sumptuary laws. They are not
                in keeping with the letter and spirit of the constitution. I vote
                ''no."

              Mr. SMITH, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called said: I would have
                been glad had the friends of Temperance adopted a different course. Every man on the
                Wabash river knows that I have been a temperance man for forty years, but I will
                vote for no bill that makes the Stare of Indiana or me a partner in that which is
                wrong. I hold that liquor selling is wrong; that it is an evil; a great evil, and a
                curse to the nation; but this will not stop it. No temperance law has been made that
                will remedy it, and until the friends of temperance start in the right direction it
                cannot be remedied. The other party in this Senate call my party the whisky party,
                and by implication they claim that they are Temperance men; and yet you Republicans
                come here and refuse to pass the very law you abuse us for not passing. I vote
                "no."

              Mr. TURNER, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote said: I should
                like to have the bill passed on account of members of the Legislature, and if it was
                applicable only to the city of Indianapolis I should give my vote for it. But as it
                is not applicable to the city of Indianapolis alone, I believe the majority of the
                people have decided that prohibition is wrong. I am opposed to the bill. I should be
                in favor of it if it applied only to members of the Legislature upon the ground,
                that I do not now expect, after to-day to be a member of this Legislative body,
                "no."

               Mr. WOLCOTT, when his name was called in explanation of his vote said: It is with
                some regret that I am compelled to vote against this bill. Senators holding over
                from the last regular session remember that I introduced Senate bill 46, a most
                stringent bill in its provisions as to the liquor traffic; and I urged it till it
                passed the Senate. I believe the intemperance of the State is a great evil, and that
                it should be restrained, but no laws, if against the moral sense of the people can
                be enforced; All reforms must proceed slowly and gradually. Had this law provided
                that at any election the question of License or No License should be submitted to
                the people, I would vote for that. But it goes much farther. It requires the
                applicant to travel over the township and get the signatures of a majority of the
                legal voters, and after he obtains these he has got to get the ratification of the
                township Trustee. Even a majority of the voters might favor the petitioner, but if
                the Trustee should be unfavorable the will of the majority would be defeated. I
                believe the law would not be just in its operations and I will vote against it
                "No."

              Mr. WOOD, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called said: I believe the
                good overbalances the evil in this bill. It provides, if I understand it, that the
                principal may be made criminally liable if convicted with his agent; and I am
                inclined to think that the courts would rule that part invalid. The first part of
                the bill which requires a petition from a majority of the legal voters of the
                Township before license is issued, I concur in. I vote "aye."

              Mr. CRAVENS, having requested his name to be called, said: I do not know but that I
                have had a little more extended and bitter experience than most members on this
                floor. I fear that the friends of this bill, who have been actuated and influenced
                by the best of motives, have been induced to press its success against what is
                manifestly the public good. In 1855, under pressure of the public sentiment-by which
                I was elected, I voted in favor of a prohibitory liquor law. I was then foolish
                enough to think that the enactment of a law by the strong power of the State would
                effect the purpose designed. I recollect during the time we were discussing this
                matter, one of the best statesmen in this State said to some of us in a room at the
                Bates House: "You need not pass that law. If you do the Courts will not sustain
                it; and if they do, public opinion will not." A friend asked him: "Then
                what would you do?" Said he: I would resort to something that is practicable
                and license the whiskydrinker himself.

              The more I have thought of that suggestion 
                the more I am satisfied that a law of that sort would be of more effect than the one
                proposed. A prohibitory law in my judgment will not be enforced. The people are
                afraid that it will strike at certain powers necessary to be maintained for the
                welfare of the country. While the bill has some unconstitutional features in it, in
                that it depends upon some other authority than that which enacts the law for the
                purpose of taking effect, on the other hand I decidedly favor the Democratic
                principle which runs through the bill; that is that the majority shall decide; for
                that great principle runs through the entire frame work of our Government. It is a
                Democratic principle and a Republican principle.

              But I see that this bill will not become a law. I see that from my keeping of the
                tally. Other considerations rise higher than mere party. From those considerations,
                and those alone of a character which no man has a right to inquire into, I give my
                voice and vote for this bill. I vote "aye."

              The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR announced the vote as above recorded.

              So the Liquor Bill [H. R. 288] failed to pass the Senate by yeas 22, nays 23.L

               FRIDAY, May, 30, 1869.
            
             [IN CONTINUATION-p. 236-FIRST
                COLUMN.]

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR commanded order at nine o'clock, and directed the
              reading of the Secretary's minutes of yesterday.

            Mr. JOHNSTON of Montgomery, demanded a call of the Senate, and it being ordered and
              taken, discovered the fact that but thirty-two Senators were present and answering to
              their names.

            Subsequently-

            After a lengthy discussion of points of order-

            Mr. GRAY demanded a call of the Senate.

            A message from the Governor being announced at the door, transmitting the names of
              members of the Senate who have presented their resignations

            Mr. BRADLEY said: Mr. President, I raise the point of order that this is not the
              Senate; it is a mob; and the communication from the Governor cannot be received.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. The chair has decided heretofore that we cannot receive a
              communication from the Governor until there is a quorum present. Call the roll.

            The Secretary proceeded with the call, pending which-

            Mr. JAQUESS, when Mr. Gifford's name was called, said: I see Mr. Gifford and two
              or three other Senators in the lobby.

            When the roll call was completed-

            Mr. GRAY said: I move that the absentees be sent for.

            Mr. BELLAMY. Mr. President: I move that we dispense with further proceeding under the
              call. It is announced that certatn Senators have resigned, and what are we to do?
              Ascertain whether they have resigned, or set here all day? If we are to ascertain
              that, we can ascertain it officially, if at all, only through the Governor. I have
              ascertained from the Secretary that the Governor's private secretary has
              delivered a message showing what Senators have resigned, and showing whether we really
              have a quorum according to the ruling of the chair or not. In order to get that
              message considered, so that it may go upon the journal and show who have resigned and
              who we have a right to send for, I move that further proceedings under the call be
              dispensed with.

            Mr. JOHNSTON of Montgomery. Has the number present been announced?

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. I do not think it has. Thirty-two: that is the number the
              Secretary's tally shows.

            Mr. BRADLEY. I would like to have the names read.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. Read the names.

            The Secretary having performed that service-

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR said: The Senator from Randolph [Mr. Gray] moves that the
              absentees be sent for.

            Mr. BRADLEY. In order to ascertain who the absentees are I move that the
              communication from the Governor be read.

            Mr. BELLAMY. That is not in order during a call of the Senate.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. It only could be done by unanimous consent.

            Mr. FISHER. The call of the roll shows who the absentees are. We don't want to
              go to the Governor to find that out. 

            

            Mr. BRADLEY, Suppose some Senator should die, or suppose one should remove from the
              State, we would have no right to send for him. And suppose some have resigned, we have
              no right to send for them. I think that communication should be read.

            Mr. GREEN. There is another way to get it on record. When the sergeant at arms gets
              his return made out. If these men are dead, civilly or politically, he can make the
              return. [Laughter.]

            Mr. BELLAMY. I move to lay the motion to send for absentees on the table.

            The motion was agreed to by yeas 26, nays 5.

            Mr. GRAY. There is no quorum present, is there?

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. No sir. There are only 32 present.

            Mr. BELLAMY. I renew my motion that further proceedings under the call be dispensed
              with.

            The motion was agreed to.

            Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President: I think it proper to receive that message. Whenever this
              Senate dispenses with further proceedings under the call, then there is no evidence
              before this body that there is no quorum present. That is the way the Senate stands
              now. In contemplation of law there is a quorum present, and any proceedings are proper
              now, and will be until it is ascertained that there is no quorum. The motion was not
              proper before, because there was pending a call of the Senate. We were proceeding
              under that call, but this Senate has dispensed with further proceedings under the call
              of the Senate, and we have a quorum as far as our record is concerned, and I think the
              motion is in order to entertain the message of the Governor, and move that the message
              now be taken up.

            Mr. JOHNSTON, of Montgomery. Mr. President: According to the proceeding this morning
              and a call of the Senate just taken there is no quorum here, and now there is a
              proposition to send for absentees. This message comes from the Governor, and is in
              relation to certain citizens. If we send for the absentees I suppose the reading of
              the message is legitimate because it proposes to show whether we can get a quorum
              here, and it is perfectly legitimate for that message to be read; as it is the only
              channel through which we can get the information.

            Mr. SCOTT. I agree with the first propotion, but deny that there is a question
              pending as to whether there is a quorum present or not.

            Mr. JOHNSTON, of Montgomery. It appears to me that the chair announced that there was
              no quorum present.

            Mr. SCOTT. The chair can only announce that the Senate dispensed with further
              proceedings under the call.

            Mr. JOHNSTON of Montgomery. The journals will show that there was a call of the
              Senate; that but 32 members answered; that immediately a motion was made to dispense
              with further proceedings under the call. The last thing was to show that there was no
              quorum,and then further proceedings under the call are dispensed with. Now we ask to
              have the communication read so we will know the cause of there being no quorum.

            Mr. SCOTT. The presumption of law is always in favor of there being a quorum. It must
              be so.

            Mr. JOHNSTON, of Montgomery. The presumption of law is frequently one way and the
              facts another.

            Mr. SCOTT, I say the presumption of law ought to be that way. Our record shows that
              we have forty-nine members qualified. We have no record - no official record showing
              any thing to the contrary;and I say the presumption of law is that there is a quorum
              upon this floor at this moment: therefore any proceeding the Senate has a mind to
              inaugurate is in order, unless pending that proceeding some Senator shall interpose a
              call of the House and it is ascertained as a matter of fact that there is no quorum
              upon the floor. The moment the Senate dispenses with further proceedings under the
              call that presumption of law again comes in, and this House cannot do business; and
              until that message of the Governor is read, showing that we have lost members since
              the organization by death, resignation or withdrawal, there is a quorum here in
              contemplation of law. I say nothing about the other questions.

            Mr. MORGAN. Mr. President: It seems from the Constitution of the State that each
              House, when assembled, shall choose its own officers (the President of the Senate
              excepted) judge the elections, qualifications and returns of its own members,
              determined its rules of proceeding, and sit upon its own adjounment. The first thing
              is to elect a moderator of the House until the Lieutenant Governor takes his chair,
              and the next thing is to see who are members-who are constituted members of the body,
              and they are competent for that purpose to judge of the elections and qualifications
              and returns of members and determine rules of proceeeding, and to sit upon their own
              adjournment. That is all they can do until they find they have got a quorum.

            Mr. SCOTT (interposing.) I desire to ask the Senator, Does he suppose the
              Constitution only applies to the organization?

            Mr. MORGAN. Of course it applies all through the sittings of the Senate, because when
              it is ascertained that there is no quorum or that persons claiming seats are not
              members, the Constitution requires us to go to work and find out whether there is a
              quorum to be found or not. And as we have had a communication from the Governor on this very point, the Senate is
              competent to receive that communication, because it is upon the very subject matter
              before us.

            Mr. FOSDICK (interposing.) How do you know that it is upon that subject?

            Mr. MORGAN. Because the announcement was made at the door.

            Mr. FOSDICK. We could not receive that announcement because we had no quorum.

            Mr. MORGAN. Mr. President: The Constitution IVth Article 10th section, says: We can
              judge the elections, qualifications and returns of our members; and that is what we
              are to do here. It is competent for this Senate to determine who are Senators and who
              are not.

            Mr. FOSDICK. Have we not already decided under that rule who are Senators? 

            Mr. MORGAN. That matter was decided six weeks ago, bnt the Republican party is a
              progressive party, and what happened six weeks ago may not stand now. They decided the
              other day that they would not take up the consideration of the proposed XVth amendment
              to the Constitution of the United States, but what did they do yesterday?

            Mr. CRAVENS. Mr. President: This seems to be a question of Constitutional law. I want
              to insist upon this proposition; for it seems to me to be as clear as any proposition,
              and that is: That we are now, according to the statements of these gentlemen, a clear
              quorum; and not only from their statements but from the showing of the roll-call. Now
              admitting, as these gentlemen say, that fifteen Senators have resigned and two
              Republicans are absent, that makes seventeen, and that would reduce---

            Mr. MORGAN (in his seat.) Sixteen Senators have resigned.

            Mr. CRAVENS. I don't care how many; that reduces us below thirty-four. Under our
              Constitution two-thirds of each House constitutes a quorum. Admitting it to be a fact
              that all of these men have resigned, as they say, and admitting the fact shown by the
              roll call that we have thirty-two members present, we every day act upon the principle
              that less than 34 in this House, and less than sixty-seven in the other House composes
              either as a House. The Constitution only requires that two-thirds of each House shall
              constitute a quorum competent to do business.

            What is a House? Suppose we start out with fifty members in the Senate and one should
              die, forty-nine would constitute the Senate; or if two should die forty-eight would
              constitute this House, and two-thirds of forty-eight would be competent to do
              business. But suppose that ten die or ten resign-suppose our number is reduced either
              by a natural or a civil death, would the power of the State of Indiana have ceased by
              a reasonable construction of the Constitution? Does It contain that principle in
              itself that it works its own destruction? You pass bills frequently when there are not
              more than thirty-four members present. You say that a bill is passed because it
              recieves twenty-six votes. Twenty-six is a mere quorum of thirty-four. You can run it
              down to where there is a bare majority. Twenty-six is a majority if you have
              thirty-four or forty; and we have now thirty-two here.

            I insist upon the proposition that under a clear construction of the Constitution we
              have now a quorum competent to do business, and in that view of the case insist upon
              the motion of the Senator from Vigo, [Mr. Scott,] for the reading of this message.
              Even if the chair decides we are not a quorum to do business, a smaller number than
              ten may sit here and receive message from the Governor. If that be not the case, why
              do a few of you remain after the close of the business every session? You have to
              receive messages yet from the House and from the Governor, and this House is perfectly
              competent to do it.

            The chair said but a moment ago that we could not receive the message because we had
              no quorum; yet the chair said the other fact that the proposition could be maintained
              by unanimous consent. If not a quorum how can the unanimous consent of this body which
              is not a Senate be given to receive a message addressed to the Senate? This message
              has come from the Governor. You set here day after day, after the Legislative business
              of the session is over, for the purpose of receiving messages from the Governor and
              from the other end of the Capitol,and you have to have the messages read. And now you
              have to remain here till Monday. This House has to be kept open, with an officer in
              that desk, and a journal has to be kept open in which the daily transactions have to
              be recorded.

            I insist that we have to read that message; we cannot do otherwise. It would be
              treating a co-ordinate branch of the Government with disrespect not to do it. And I
              want it read to show the fact conclusive and legally that there is not what these men
              have called a quorum of this body. And I want it decided by this body whether or not
              there is a quorum here provided there is over twenty-six members present, or whether
              it is in the power of one man or fifteen to destroy the power of the government.

            If it developes the fact that so many Senators have resigned with a view to reduce
              the number below a certain number, 1 want this body to determine it and pass some act
              of legislation and let it go to the Courts of the State, and let them determine
              whither a factious minority of one or fifteen men can destroy the Legislative power of
              this State. I do not see how we can refuse to read the message. 

            

            Mr. GRAY. It is for the chair to decide; whether there is a quorum present.

            Mr. SCOTT. The chair never determines there is a quorum-he has no business to do so.
              The only way that is ascertained must be by a roll call. I think that is enough for
              this proposition. At the last regular session, after these gentlemen had resigned too,
              the chair did entertain a message from the Governor which was read and spread upon the
              journal on the eighth day of March, wherein the Governor reported his approval of a
              certain bill to this House. 

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. If there was any such message come in it was not while I was
              in the chair. If it was on the eighth I was not in the chair, for I had gone home.

            Mr. SCOTT. I did not say that the present incumbent was in the chair. I only cited it
              as a precedent for whatever it is worth.

            Mr. HOOPER. While I hold that we can do no Legislative act without a quorum yet I
              insist we ought to receive this message because of our peculiar position. At this
              moment the presumption of law is that we have a quorum here. We were proceeding under
              a call of the House and we dispensed with that call. Now what situation does that
              leave us in? Clearly in the presumption of law, with a quorum present. There is
              nothing showing to the contrary in the journal, and at this particular moment, unless
              something else intervenes the presumption of law is that we have a quorum.

            FISHER. Suppose on the question to receive this message the yeas and nays should be
              called, what would be the result?

            Mr. HOOPER. That would unquestionably show there is no quorum and would defeat the
              matter. But would it not be prudent to refrain from calling the yeas and nays and let
              the message come in?

            Mr. SCOTT. The proposition in accordance with a ruling of the chair made a short time
              ago, could be entertained by unanimous consent. Of course it cannot be otherwise; but
              that unanimous consent is shown by no man calling for the yeas and nays or asking for
              a call of the House.

            Mr. STEIN. Mr. President: I agree with the Senator from Vigo, [Mr. Scott,] that this
              message ought to be taken up, but I disagree with the opinion that we have no right to
              receive it because we have no quorum. For the life of me I cannot see it in that way.
              A fact being once established a continuation of that feet is supposed to go on, and we
              must have new evidence before we can consider ourselves with a quorum. I will accept
              the opinion of foe President as regards that question, for the present. We have been
              acting upon the premises all the time heretofore: that we would not pretend to go on
              with business so long as the last record showed that we had no quorum 

            Unless we have the right to receive this message we are at a dead lock, and have
              simply to sit here and adjourn or send for those absent. But we know there are
              resigned members who cannot be brought here. Whenever we put a construction upon the
              constitution which leads us into an absurdity we must know that we put the wrong
              construction upon it. The Constitution says that less than a quorum have powers; and
              they may adjourn or send for absentees; and we are strictly confined to this. But when
              we send for absentees, other powers incidentally come as a matter of course. This
              message purports to be from the Governor giving us some information with regard to
              absentees; and I say we have a right to receive anything that is calculated to put us
              in possession of necessary facts concerning the sending for absentees. As this is a
              paper which purports to give us that information I say it ought to be received and
              must be received. The parliamentary authority cited is to the effect that we cannot
              receive messages without a quorum, but that relates to Legislative business evidently.
              I claim that we have a right to received any message, verbal or written, or any
              evidence that qualifies us to send for absentees.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. I want to state to the Senate my own notion about this
              matter. In the first place it is manifest that we cannot receive a message from the
              Governor without we have a quorum present. Presuming that this was a message in the
              ordinary way of communication to the General Assembly, when the point of order was
              made by the Senator from Laporte[Mr. Bradley]that this message could not be received,
              I sustained the point. But it is assumed that this message relates to a quorum of the
              House--

            Mr. WOLCOTT (interrupting.) The Governor's private Secretary announced that fact
              at the door.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. The Secretary has no right to give the contents of a message
              in that way. That goes for nothing. At the commencement of the session the Senator
              from Whitley, or the Senator from Jefferson, introduced a resolution calling upon the
              Secretary of State to know whether any members had been elected, and I ruled that
              resolution in order because it tended to perfect the organization of the Senate. I
              will now decide that the message may be read for information and then the chair will
              determine whether it goes to the point. If it does the chair will order that the
              message be received.

            Mr. BELLAMY. I call for the reading of the message. 

            

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR (to the Secretary.) Read the message.

            Mr. GRAY. There is no precedent in Legislative history where a Legislative body ever
              sent to the Governor to ascertain who are absentees.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. The Senator will remember that we sent to the Secretary of
              State at the commencement of the session to find out whether we should ever have a
              quorum or not.

            Mr. GRAY, What would be the decision of the chair if a Senator objects to the reading
              of the message.

            LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. I would put the question to the Senate. (To the Secretary.) Read
              the message for information!

            Mr. GRAY, I object.

            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR, Objection is made. All who favor the reading Of the paper
              say "aye." Contrary "no." The "ayes" have it; it will
              now be read for information.

            The Secretary read the message printed on page 236 of these Reports. 

          
          

          
          
            SUPPLEMENTARY TO THE BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
              VOLUME ELEVENTH.
            Standing Rules and Orders for the Government of the Senate.
            IN SENATE.
            
               TUESDAY, April 13, 1869.
            
            [IN CONTINUATION-p. 4l-FIRST
                COLUMN.]

             Mr. STEIN, from the Committee on Rules of the Senate, reported
              the rules of last session with changes in rules Nos. 8, 20, 36, and 40, and inserting
              37 and 38 of the session of 1867.

            After debate thereon the amendments were adopted except the amendment proposed to
              rule 36.

            So the rules for the Special Session are as follows:

            1. The President shall take the Chair every day precisely at two o'clock in the
              afternoon during the first fifteen days of the session, and thereafter at nine
              o'clock in the forenoon and two o'clock in the afternoon, unless the Senate
              shall, by motion, have adjourned to some other hour appointed by such motion. He shall
              immediately call the Senators to order; and, on the appearance of two-thirds, shall
              cause the journal of the preceding day to be read.

            2. Nine Senators with the President, or ten in his absence, having chosen a President
                pro tem., shall be authorized to call a
              Senate, compel the attendance of absent Senators, make an order for their fine or
              censure, and may adjourn.

            3. The President shall preserve order and decorum, may speak to points of order in
              preference to Senators, rising from his seat for that purpose; and shall decide
              questions of order, subject to an appeal to the Senate by any two Senators, on which
              appeal no Senator shall speak more than once, unless by leave of the Senate.

            4. The President shall rise to put a question, i but may state it sitting.

            5. Questions shall be distinctly put in this form, to-wit: "As many as are of
              the opinion that (as the question may be) say Aye," and after the affirmative
              voice is expressed, "As many as are of the contrary opinion, say No." If the
              President doubts, or a division be called for, the Senate shall divide; those in the
              affirmative of the question shall first rise from their seats, and afterwards those in
              the negative.

            6. The President shall have a general direction of the Senate Chamber. He shall have
              the right to name any Senator to perform the duties of the Chair, but such
              substitution shall not extend beyond an adjournment. He shall have the right to name
              any Senator to bear messages to the House, and to appoint all committees, subject to
              the addition of other Senators upon motion.

            7. The President shall, when the Senate is equally divided give the casting vote.

            8. Twenty-eight Standing Committees, not to exceed seven members, shall be appointed
              at the commencement of each session, viz:

            
              On Elections.

              On Swamp Lands.
              On Temperance.
              On County and Township Business.
              On Eight and Privileges of the Inhabitants of the
                  State.
              On the House of Refuge.
            

            9. It shall be the duty of the Committee on Elections to examine
              and report upon the certificates and other credentials of the Senators returned to
              serve in the Senate and to take into consideration all petitions, documents and
              evidence relating to elections, which may be referred to them by the Senate; and each
              o the other committees shall perform such services, and take into consideration all
              subjects and matters required of them by the Senate.

            10. No Committee shall sit during the sitting of the Senate without special
              leave.

            11. All questions relating to the priority of business shall be decideded without
              debate.

            12. When any Senator is about to speak in debate, or deliver any matter to the
              Senate, he shall rise from his seat, respectfully address himself to the question
              under debate, and avoid personality. No Senator shall impeach the motives of any other
              Senator's vote or argument.

            13. If any Senator, in speaking or otherwise, transgress the rules of the Senate, the
              President shall, or any Senator may, call him to order; in which case, the Senator so
              called to order, shall immediately sit down, unless permitted to explain; and the
              Senate shall, if appealed to, decide the case, but without debate. If there be no
              appeal, the decision of the Chair shall be submitted to. If the decision be in favor
              of the Senator called to order, he shall be at liberty to proceed. If otherwise, and
              the case require it, he shall be liable to the censure of the Senate.

            14. When two or more Senators happen to rise at once, the President shall name who is
              first to speak.

            15. No Senator shall speak more than twice on the same question without leave of the
              Senate, nor more than once until every member choosing to speak shall have spoken.

            16. While the President is putting the question, or addressing the Senate, no Senator
              shall walk across or out of the house, nor when a Senator is speaking shall any
              entertain private discourse, or pass between him and the Chair.

            17. No Senator shall be compelled to vote on any question in the event of which he is
              immediately and particularly interested, or in any case where he was not present when
              the question was put; but appearing afterwards may, by permission, have his name
              called and vote.

            18. Upon a division and count of the Senate on any question, no Senator without the
              bar should be counted.

            19. Every Senator who shall be in the house when the question is put, shall give his
              vote unless the Senate for special reasons, excuse him. But the question of excusing a
              Senator shall be decided summarily, without debate.

            20. When a motion is made and seconded it shall be stated by the President; or being
              in writing, it shall be handed to the Secretary and then read aloud before debated. 

            21. Every motion shall be reduced to writing, if the President or any Senator desire
              it.

            22. After a motion is stated by the President and read, it shall be deemed in
              possession of the Senate, but may be withdrawn at any time before decision or
              amendment.

            23. When a question is under debate, no motion shall be received but 
                To adjourn;
                To lie on the table;
                For the previous question;
                To postpone indefinitely;
                To postpone to a certain day;
                To commit; or
                To amend.
              
            

            Which several motions shall have precedence in the order in which they stand
              arranged.

            24. When a question is postponed indefinitely, the same shall not be acted upon
              during the session.

            25. The previous question shall be put in this form: "Shall the main question be
              now put?" It shall only be admitted when demanded by a majority of the Senators
              voting; and until it is decided shall preclude all debate, and the introduction of all
              further amendments. The main question shall be the first question in order, and its
              effect shall be to put an end to all debate, and bring the Senate to a direct vote on
              the subsidiary questions then pending, in their order, and then on the main
              question.

            26. Motions and reports may be committed at the pleasure of the Senate.

            27. Any member may call for the division of a question where the sense will admit of
              it.

            28. No new motion or proposition shall be admitted under color of amendment, as a
              substitute for the motion or proposition under derate.

            29. When a motion has once been made and carried in the affirmative or negative, it
              shall be in order for any Senator of the majority to move a reconsideration thereof on
              the same or any other day during the session, but such motion can be entertained but once during the same
              session.

            30. When the reading of a paper is called for, if any objection is made, it shall be
              decided by a vote of the Senate.

            31. The unfinished business in which the Senate was engaged at the last preceding
              adjournment, shall have the preference in the orders of the day, and no motion or any
              other business shall be received, without special leave of the Senate until the former
              is disposed of.

            32. If a question depending be lost by adjournment of the Senate, and revived on the
              succeeding day, no Senator who shall have spoken twice on the preceding day, shall be
              permitted again to speak without leave.

            33. Petitions, memorials, and other papers addressed to the Senate, may be presented
              by the President, or by any Senator.

            34. A motion to adjourn shall always be in order, except when the previous question
              is pending, and shall be decided without debate. The question pending on adjournment
              shall be resumed on reassembling, unless otherwise ordered, by the Senate.

            35. It shall be in order for the Committee on Phraseology, Arrangement and
                Enrollment of Bills, to report at any time when no question is before the
              Senate.

            36. Every bill shall be introduced by motion on leave, or by order of the Senate.

            37. Every bill shall receive three several readings in the Senate previous to its
              passage, and all bills shall be dispatched as they are introduced, unless in case of
              urgency.

            38. The first reading of a bill shall be for information, and if opposition be made
              to it, the question shall be: Shall the bill be rejected? If no opposition be made, or
              the question to reject be negatived, the bill shall go for its second reading without
              a question.

            39. Upon the second reading of a bill, the President shall state that it is ready for
              commitment, amendment, or engrossment; and if committed, then the question shall be:
              Whether to a select or standing Committee, or to a Committee of the Whole
                Senate? If to a Committee of the Whole Senate, the
              Senate shall determine on what days; but if the bill be ordered to be engrossed, the
              Senate shall appoint the day when it shall be read the third time. It shall be in
              order to read bills on their second reading by title, for reference, and when so
              referred, it shall be in order for the Committee to which they shall be referred, to
              report on the same with or without amendments, and the bill, when returned, shall be
              upon the second reading, and shall then, with the amendments proposed, if any, be read
              through by sections.

            40. Every report of a committee upon a bill, which shall not be considered at the
              time of making the same, or laid on the table by a vote of the Senate, shall stand
              upon the general orders with a bill, and entered on the Journal.

            41. After commitment and report thereof to the Senate, or at any time before its
              passage, a bill may be recommitted.

            42. No amendment by way of a rider shall be received to a bill on its third
              reading.

            43. When a bill shall pass, it shall be certified by the Secretary noting, at the
              foot thereof, the day of its passage.

            44. In forming a Committee of the Whole Senate, the President
              leaving the Chair, shall appoint a Chairman to preside.

            45. Upon bills committed to a Committee of the Whole Senate, the
              bill shall be first read throughout by the Secretary, and then again read and debated
              by clauses, leaving the preamble to be last considered. The body of the bill shall not
              be defaced or interlined, but all amendments, noting the page and line, shall be duly
              entered by the Secretary on a separate paper, as the same shall be agreed to by the
              Committee, and so reported to the Senate; after report, the bill shall again be
              subject to be debated and amended by clauses, before a question to engross it be
              taken.

            46. All questions, whether in Committee or in the Senate, shall be put in the order
              in which they are moved, except that in filling up blanks, the largest sum and longest
              time shall be first put.

            47. No motion or proposition for a tax or charge upon the people shall be discussed
              the day on which it is made or offered; and every such proposition shall receive its
              first discussion in a Committee of the Whole Senate.

            48. The rules of proceeding in the Senate shall be observed in a Committee of the
              Whole Senate, so far as they may be applicable, except the rule limiting the time of
              speaking, but no Senator shall speak twice to any question until every Senator
              choosing to speak shall have spoken.

            49. No standing rule or order of the Senate shall be rescinded or changed without one
              day's notice being given of the motion therefor.

            50. No Senator shall absent himself from the service of the Senate, unless he have
              leave, or be sick and unable to attend.

            51. Each officer of the Senate shall take an oath for the true and faithful discharge
              of the duties of his office, to the best of his knowledge and abilities; and shall be
              deemed to continue in office until another is chosen.

            52. It shall be the duty of the Doorkeeper to attend the Senate during its sittings;
              execute all its demands and process to him given and directed; give notice of and
              carry all messages, either public or private, he may be required to carry; keep the
              Senate chamber and furniture clean and in due
              order, and at all times keep good and sufficient fires, when the same may be
              necessary; when requested to call a Senator, he shall do so by name.

            53. When a reference is made of any subject to a standing committee, the Senator
              introducing the same shall be a member of such committee during its deliberations
              thereon, but shall have no power to vote.

            54. The daily order of transacting business shall be as follows, viz:

            
              Reading and correcting the Journal of the preceding day.
              Introduction of petitions, memorials and remonstrances.

              Resolutions of the Senate.

              Orders of the day: 
                  Messages from the House, requiring action on the part of the
                    Senate.
                  Bills on second reading.
                  Bills on third reading.
                
              
            

            55. In all joint meetings of the two houses of the Legislature, convened for a
              specific purpose, it shall be incompetent for this body, Or its members, to engage in
              such joint meetings in the transaction of any other business than that for which they
              were so specially assembled.

            56. When a bill or joint resolution shall have failed for want of a constitutional
              majority, but shall have received the vote of the majority of the members present, it
              shall be subject to be called up in its order, at the instance of any Senator, on any
              subsequent day, but when it shall have failed to receive the votes of a majority of
              the members present, it shall only be again called up by a motion to reconsider the
              previous vote.
