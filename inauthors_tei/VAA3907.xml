                <p rend="sc">BORN AT SEA, NOVEMBER 18, 1844.<lb/> DIED AT INDIANAPOLIS, JULY 4,
                    1887.</p>
                <p>After five years one may be surer of a judgment than on the day it is formed. In
                    that time there is opportunity for a change of attitude and for frequent
                    revision of opinion. In the case of an estimate of a man, it is possible to
                    speak more dispassionately and with greater fairness. When Ben. D. House died,
                    July 4, 1887, there were those of his friends who believed he left behind him
                    literary work that would live. After half a decade those friends still believed
                    in the vitality of his verse, and they wish, by this volume, to put in permanent
                    form certain of his poems which have seemed to be worthy of a more stable
                    setting than scrap-books. The verse contained in this volume is selected from a
                    mass of manuscript and from the poems printed by Mr. House and given the
                    sanction of his own signature. <pb n="2" id="VAA3907-006"/> In coming to this
                    work, the editors have been guided by a sense of what their friend, were he
                    living, would approve.</p>
                <p>The life of Ben. D. House was a strange one. The restless waters of the ocean on
                    which he was born were the prophetic symbol of his life; through it all there
                    floated &quot; the murmurs and scents of the infinite sea.&quot; Details
                    of biography are lacking. We know that Mr. House&apos;s father was a
                    Congregational clergyman, a man of cultivation, who took great interest in the
                    sciences. The family resided at St. Johnsbury, Vt., and at other points in New
                    England. The boy Benjamin (it was characteristic that he should always abridge
                    his name) did not take kindly to the schools. He fought discipline as a boy, and
                    throughout his life he maintained a personal independence that frequently
                    involved him in difficulties. But if his education was largely self-acquired, it
                    was wide in its range, and it was drawn from many sources. His memory was
                    phenomenal, and what he read or learned by observation was never lost.</p>
                <pb n="3" id="VAA3907-007"/>
                <p>The last of several fruitless efforts to bring the boy under the influence of
                    teaching was being made at Boston when the civil war began. He promptly enlisted
                    in a Massachusetts regiment and served throughout the conflict. He was utterly
                    without the sense of fear; his spirit was that of the old chivalry that dared to
                    do for the sake of doing, without question. He was wounded several times. At
                    Fair Oaks he received an injury in the throat while riding a charge, and this,
                    after a score of years, caused his death. The war impressed itself strongly upon
                    the boy, and its influence upon his unformed character was not the best. It is
                    easy now to look back and see how much higher and broader his career would have
                    been had he not been plunged into the varying life of the soldier. The war was a
                    school that taught no elementary branches; it was, to him, a university that
                    unfolded far too rapidly the tremendous passions of life. The end of hostilities
                    found the young man out of a congenial employment, and poorly equipped for the
                    battles of peace. When a discharge was given him <pb n="4" id="VAA3907-008"/> he
                    was at Indianapolis engaged in some clerical work connected with the dissolution
                    of the army. By so slight a chance as this he became a resident of the city, and
                    lived there the remainder of his life, with only one protracted absence. He was
                    employed on various Indianapolis newspapers at different times and in different
                    capacities; chiefly in the line of executive work. He was not adapted by
                    temperament or by education to the writing of serious prose; he had no taste for
                    editorial writing.</p>
                <p>In 1872 he went to St. Louis with several Indianapolis gentlemen who had
                    purchased the Democrat. Here he made some reputation by the writing of condensed
                    paragraphs for the editorial page. It was at this time, perhaps, that he did his
                    best work as a journalist. This employment did not last long, however, and on
                    returning to Indianapolis, Mr. House resumed his work for newspapers. On January
                    27, 1873, Mr. House was married to Miss Mary Arnold Sharpe, daughter of John S.
                    Sharpe, at Indianapolis. For some years he was employed in the United States
                    pension agency. He served six terms (from 1881 to 1887) as adjutant-general of
                    the <pb n="5" id="VAA3907-009"/> G. A. R. of Indiana. That organization was dear
                    to him; its democracy and good fellowship appealed to him strongly, and he was
                    always proud of his identification with it.</p>
                <p>Mr. House&apos;s poems are an interesting study. He wrote easily; indeed, so
                    little effort was required that he was prone to accept as final defective work
                    which he might have made perfect by the exercise of a little more care. The
                    peaceful Whittier he loved better than any other poet; from the serene Quaker he
                    derived many ideas of form. Whittier was a model, but not to the sacrifice of
                    his own individuality. He was too strong a character, by far, to follow
                    servilely in the path of another. Yet, in his poems of nature, it is possible to
                    see the influence of the master upon his pupil. Mr. House&apos;s war poems,
                    and his poems to and of the veterans, are among his best. They are vigorous in
                    execution and bold in their originality.</p>
                <p>His &quot;Present Arms!&quot; is a stirring song of the nation&apos;s
                    birthday. Mr. House was in demand as a reader of original poems at reunions of
                    veterans and on like occasions. At the dedication of the Knights- <pb n="6"
                        id="VAA3907-010"/> town Home for Soldiers&apos; Orphans he recited to
                    the children a poem of singular beauty. He wrote nothing better than this
                    quatrain from that poem:</p>
                <lg>
                    <l>No dole of charity ye eat</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">But bread from grain that shall not fail</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">Out beaten when war&apos;s sounding flail</l>
                    <l>Threshed out men&apos;s souls like grains of wheat.</l>
                </lg>
                <p>His poetry of patriotism certainly deserves a place in our Indiana literature,
                    and in the literature that has grown out of the civil war. Its vigor, its
                    sincerity, its imagination, are notable.</p>
                <p>The love poems which Mr. House wrote from time to time are unequal, but a number
                    of them are exquisite in their tenderness. &quot;Alter Ego&quot; and
                    &quot;Leander to Hero&quot; are contributions to the world of amatory
                    verse.</p>
                <p>It is not maintained that Mr. House was a genius, nor that he was a profound
                    scholar. He was neither the one nor the other. But his gifts of composition were
                    far above the ordinary. He knew, by a kind of intuition, the value of any
                    certain poetic idea that came to him; he put the proper ap- <pb n="7"
                        id="VAA3907-011"/> praisement on his material and employed it to the best
                    advantage. It will be observed that there was no great variety of measure and no
                    distinguishing versatility in the verse forms which he employed. He wrote blank
                    verse occasionally, and often effectively. In the poems presented in this volume
                    no changes have been made except in the correction of obvious errors. It was a
                    fault of Mr. House's literary workmanship that he sometimes repeated phrases,
                    consciously or unconsciously, but his offenses were few.</p>
                <p>Mr. House was something of an Oriental in his tastes. He was fond of perfumes,
                    and of them, as of jewels, he knew a great deal. He was familiar with art and
                    knew well the points of paintings, sculpture and architecture.</p>
                <p>There are those of us to whom Thyrsis was particularly dear. He was a charming
                    companion, and conversed on a great diversity of topics. He had a fund of rare
                    good humor. His point of view was frequently cynical, but he was not always to
                    be taken at his own word. There was no <hi rend="i">via media</hi> in <pb n="8"
                        id="VAA3907-012"/> . his friendships; he was a good laver and a good hater.
                    His fiends will recall often the man, &apos;in his habit as he
                    lived.&apos; He was a picturesque and striking figure on the street of the
                    city. For those who knew him it will be possible always to bring him back -- the
                    large, strong frame; the cloak, the broad hat, the swinging gait. lie was quite
                    nearsighted and at his desk bent close to his book or paper. Recalling so slight
                    a thing as this attitude sends a pain to the heart and makes us see again the
                    high forehead, the sad gray eyes.</p>
                <p>Bits of Songs that he loved are borne in on this tide of memory. The early haze
                    of autumn hangs along the horizon as these words are penned, and the sympathetic
                    voice of our Thyrsis- &quot;we still had Thyrsis then!&apos; -repeats
                    the words he loved so well&quot;:</p>

                    <lg>
                        <l>Hast thou still, O throbless heart,</l>
                        <l>In this life of mine a part?</l>
                        <l>Canst thou backward look o&apos;er ways</l>
                        <l>Thou hast gone, unto the days</l>
                        <l>When I told my love to you</l>
                        <l>And thou saidst &quot; Me know you do?&quot;</l>
                        <l>Ah, my heart is sad and sore</l>
                        <l>Where is graven &quot;never more!&quot;</l>
                        <l>When the light and darkness meet,</l>
                        <l>Then the patter of thy feet</l>
                        <l>Often in the growing gloom</l>
                        <l>Echoes through the lonely room,</l>
                        <l>And mine eyes are dim and wet</l>
                        <l>With the dew of love&apos;s regret;</l>
                        <l>Yet again I see thine eyes,</l>
                        <l>Blue as skies of paradise,</l>
                        <l>And with evening breezes bland</l>
                        <l>Comes the touch of thy soft hand</l>

                        <l>And I hear thy dear lips speak-</l>
                        <l>See thee for bright blossoms seek;</l>
                        <l>Clover bloom or lilac spray,</l>
                        <l>Every flower was thy &quot; bouquet.&quot;</l>
                        <l>When thou brought&apos;st such childish prize,</l>
                        <l>Then I saw them with thine eyes;</l>
                        <l>Aught that thy dear hand might glean</l>
                        <l>Seemed to me or poor or mean,</l>
                        <l>And thy childish fancy mine,</l>
                        <l>Saw but &quot;lamps&quot; in firefly&apos;s shine;</l>
                        <l>When the rain the earth would seek,</l>
                        <l>Saw with thee the heavens &quot;leak.&quot;</l>
                        <l>Thou the past brought back to me;</l>
                        <l>I, a child again through thee.</l>

                        <l>Ah, my love has all these years,</l>
                        <l>Through the telescope of tears,</l>
                        <l>Sought thee ever in its flight</l>
                        <l>Through the spaces infinite;</l>
                        <l>Past the sunset&apos;s cloudy bars,</l>
                        <l>Climbing up the stair of stars;</l>
                        <l>Groping through doubt&apos;s clouded land</l>
                        <l>For the guidance of thy hand.</l>

                        <l>But thy finding I have missed</l>
                        <l>In the ether&apos;s amethyst.</l>
                        <l>Though unseen to mortal eye,</l>
                        <l>Love asserts that thou art nigh.</l>
                        <l>Ah, thou cold philosophy!</l>
                        <l>Vain thy logic is to me;</l>
                        <l>She I love is with me there</l>
                        <l>Though I reach and clasp but air,</l>
                        <l>And through loving infinite</l>
                        <l>I shall yet be granted sight;</l>
                        <l>Its sad search will not be vain;</l>
                        <l>Love will have its own again;</l>
                        <l>Death can not its purpose balk</l>
                        <l>Though a darkened path I walk,</l>
                        <l>For some occult process yet</l>
                        <l>Side by side our feet shall set,</l>
                        <l>And thy childish hand&apos;s caress</l>
                        <l>With love&apos;s benediction bless.</l>
                        <l>I, again, shall hold thee fast,</l>

                        <l>Tell again my love to you,</l>

                    <lg>
                        <l>From filaments of undirected thought,</l>
                        <l>That cobweb all the halls of sleep with dreams,</l>
                        <l>I swept these threads into the glare of day:</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>Beside a figure robed in ashen gray,</l>
                        <l>And cowled so that his face I could not see,</l>
                        <l>I walked adown a rock-strewn, rugged path.</l>
                        <l>His hand held mine in firm but gentle clasp,</l>
                        <l>And, though his mien was that of majesty,</l>
                        <l>I felt no fear, but only such regret</l>
                        <l>As comes to us at parting of life&apos;s ways</l>
                        <l>When we have turned our backs on those we love.</l>
                        <l>I held not back, though well I seemed to know</l>
                        <l>I walked a way my feet should ne&apos;er retrace.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l> We came unto a river&apos;s bank and paused,</l>
                        <l>Where lying moored I saw a splendid barge,</l>
                        <l>Such as no doge, who went to cast his ring</l>
                        <l>Into the Adriatic&apos;s depths, e&apos;er used</l>
                        <pb n="48" id="VAA3907-052"/>
                        <l>In consummation of the wedding rite</l>
                        <l>That capped him Venice&apos;s reigning head and lord.</l>
                        <l>Nor could that barge in which the lily maid</l>
                        <l>Of Astolat took passage, that her face</l>
                        <l>Might thence for aye be held in Lancelot&apos;s heart,</l>
                        <l>Compare with this I saw moored at the bank.</l>
                        <l>Upon its white and shining deck was spread</l>
                        <l>A couch whose draperies overflowed its sides</l>
                        <l>In rippling folds and to the water fell</l>
                        <l>And trailed like wake of phosphorescent glow.</l>
                        <l>With courteous gesture of command my guide</l>
                        <l>Waved me to mount the barge&apos;s polished deck.</l>
                        <l>No obolus or other ferry fee</l>
                        <l>He asked, but quick unmoored and stepped aboard.</l>
                        <l>Then, as impeding garments off are cast</l>
                        <l>By those who have a work of strength to do,</l>
                        <l>His cowl and frock of ashen gray fell off,</l>
                        <l>And Charon stood revealed the barge&apos;s lord.</l>
                        <l>But with this knowledge came no thought of dread.</l>
                        <l>His not the stony face of some black sphynx,</l>
                        <l>To fright the soul with eyes of gorgon glare</l>
                        <pb n="49" id="VAA3907-053"/>
                        <l>But every line showed kind and settled calm,</l>
                        <l>And all about the mouth were prophecies</l>
                        <l>That yet might ripen into sofest smiles.</l>
                        <l>Too kingly he to crouch at laboring oars,</l>
                        <l>He took from off the deck a grander staff</l>
                        <l>Than proudest pontiff of the earth e&apos;er bore,</l>
                        <l>Full trapped for ceremonies of the church,</l>
                        <l>And with grand strength propelled the barge from land.</l>
                        <l>The ripples parted &apos;round the gliding prow,</l>
                        <l>And lying couched I looked upon the stream,</l>
                        <l>Nor saw a murky, dank and sluggish flow,</l>
                        <l>Scum-coated from the ooze of swampy fens,</l>
                        <l>But limpid waters, smitten with the light</l>
                        <l>Of almost level beams of setting sun.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>Then came a thought of something like regret</l>
                        <l>That I might never see reversed the course</l>
                        <l>The barge now held from off the fading shore.</l>
                        <l>And on this thread of thought was strung the wish</l>
                        <l>That to the friends I late had parted from</l>
                        <l>I might a message bear, or send, to tell</l>

                        <l>How naught but slander had made foul this stream,</l>
                        <l>And carved a black and stony face on him,</l>
                        <l>The kindest-visaged vassal of the Lord</l>
                        <l>That ever pitied souls in search of rest.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l> As further still we drew off from the land,</l>
                        <l>About us seemed to flit familiar forms</l>
                        <l>That I had known as friends in other days.</l>
                        <l>Far inland from the mystic river&apos;s marge</l>
                        <l>On which I sailed, I knew not to what port,</l>
                        <l>They hovered, incorporeal as the film</l>
                        <l>We see arise in heated summer days</l>

                        <l>Were waking one by one, and wafting me</l>
                        <l>The welcome of their flower-laden breath,</l>

                        <l> * * * And so I lay, lapped in a trustful calm,</l>
                        <l>My half-closed eyes fixed on a nearing shore;</l>
                        <l>But as I thought the barge&apos;s bottom shoaled</l>
