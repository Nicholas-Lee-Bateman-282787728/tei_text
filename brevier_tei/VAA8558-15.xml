                <p>THESE Reporters deem it reasonable, that, along with the announcement of another
                    volume, they should declare some of the considerations which encourage them to
                    make it. One of these reporters was of the staff of writers organized for
                    verbatim reports in Congress at the expense of the treasury in 1848, which gave
                    to history the Congressional Globe, Dr. Houston's Proceedings and Debates of the
                    National Senate and the Congressional Record. In 1857, seeing the general
                    appreciation of these national works, and with some notion of their value, these
                    reporters adventured their hands in connection with the local; daily press, for
                    reports of Proceedings and Debates in the Indiana Legislature This connection
                    with the daily press has proved unfortunate; though the demand for their Reports
                    has protracted it, under all the difficulties involved, till the close of the
                    last Session of the last General Assembly.</p>
                <p>These difficulties consist principally, perhaps, in the unfitness of the
                    vanishing newspaper for any complete historical depository: but there were
                    others which appeared at once, and increased with the growing Municipality of
                    Indianapolis - Whilst the BREVIER could not pretend to absolute completeness as
                    to the records of proceedings and debates, its completeness proved to be too
                    much for the newspaper: and the newspaper worked against the Reports by
                    restricting the space contracted and paid for the Reports, by sinister marrings
                    of the "copy," and editorial mention. So the connection was made sometimes with
                    the newspaper of one political bias, and sometimes with that of another bias,
                    but always with the same result of unfitness and clashing of interest and whims.
                    The newspaper saw that the BREVIER might interfere with the precedent of
                    subsidies it had always received from the treasury for the supply of current
                    news-reading to members of the Legislature and the people, under the name of
                    compensation for their legislative reports which excepting so far as the
                    presence of the BREVIER may have constrained it to behave better as soon as the
                    legislative subscriptions were accorded, they failed not to reduce to the
                    scrimping style and space of a telegraphic dispatch. But the last Legislature
                    finding that the cost, of their newspaper subsidies exceeded that of the
                    authorized BREVIER REPORTS, the subsidy was cut off by the act of Dec. 19, 1872
                    By that act the newspaper became justly and legally recognized as but
                    "stationery" for the people and their representatives, and, by implication, as
                    unfitted and unworthy to be intrusted an authorized at the public expense as the
                    depository of their solemn legislative records. The BREVIER REPORTS, however
                    were continued through the succeeding regular session of the General Assembly of
                    1873 - two years ago - still with this unfit and hostile newspaper connection,
                    when these reporters were compelled to sever it finally for reasons stated, and
                    which the following statement in their page of errata may also express: The
                    journals of the business of both Houses as well as the debates, almost every day
                    of the session, were marred by the diminutions practiced in the office of the
                    Indianapolis <hi rend="i">Daily Sentinel</hi> for which these reports were
                    originally furnished under a contract designed to provide against such
                    interferences."</p>
                <p>Gathering from these experiences, that it has become a purpose accepted and
                    determined by the people of the State to continue the BREVIER form of their
                    legislative records as the cheapest, the best, and the best provocative and sign
                    of the popular demand for more acceptable legislative reports by the press at
                    large, these reporters have prepared themselves to furnish the work once more -
                    this time independently of the newspaper.</p>
                <p>The fact that the BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS have been acceptable to the
                    Legislature and the people every session since the first volume for the extra
                    session of 1858 cannot be taken as authorizing the work for the present session.
                    The work has stood sternly on its merits with each particular session since: and
                    with that understanding on the part of these reporters, it is offered now; with
                    the ability and desire to make such an abridgement of State Legislative Record
                    in the best form and at the cheapest rate.</p>
                <p>Therefore the offer is continued: To furnish the proceedings and debates in this
                    form for two-thirds of a cent a page per copy to the extent of 1750 copies, (the
                    same number that has been uniformly printed of the BREVIER, the laws and
                    journals ).</p>
                <p>This proposition is made in good faith, and submitted with knowledge of its
                    responsibilities. It is delicately submitted further, that by it the Legislature
                    may, at the smallest possible cost to the Treasury, secure an impartial and
                    reliable record of its Proceedings and Donates for the press and the people.</p>

                <p>Having heretofore, several times, made known to the Legislature and the country
                    their readiness to be relieved from the publication of the BREVIER LEGISLATIVE

                    reliable record of its Proceedings and Debates for the press and the people;
                    that the body knows what it will do, and may act at an early day so as to
                    justify these reasonable conjectures of the undersigned, or relieve them from
                    further labor and expense in this matter. Meanwhile they will work, as
                    heretofore, and wait for authorization and orders.</p>

                    SENATE.<lb/> [IN FORCE AT THE LAST SESSION.]</head>
                <p>1. The President shall take the chair every day precisely at ten o'clock in the
                    forenoon, and two o'clock in the afternoon, unless the Senate shall, by motion,
                    have adjourned to some other hour appointed by such motion. He shall immediately
                    call the Senators to order; and, on the appearance of two-thirds, shall cause
                    the journal of the preceeding day to be read.</p>
                <p>2. Nine Senators with the President, or ten in his absence, having chosen a
                    President <hi rend="i">pro tem</hi>, shall be authorized to call a Senate,
                    compel the attendance of the absent Senators, make an order for their fine or
                    censure and may adjourn.</p>
                <p>3. The President shall preserve order and decorum, may speak to points of order
                    in preference to Senators, rising from his seat for that purpose; and shall
                    decide questions of order, subject to an appeal to the Senate, by any two
                    Senators, on which appeal no Senator shall speak more than once, unless by leave
                    of the Senate.</p>
                <p>4. The President shall rise to put a question, but may state it sitting.</p>
                <p>5. Questions shall be distinctly put in this form, to-wit: ''As many as are of
                    the opinion, that (as the question may be) say Aye," and after the affirmative
                    voice is expressed, "an many as are of the contrary opinion, say No." If the
                    President doubts or a division be called for, the Senate shall divide; those in
                    the affirmative of the question, shall first rise from their seats, and
                    afterward those in the negative.</p>
                <p>6. The President shall have a general direction of the Senate Chamber. He shall
                    have the right to name any Senator to perform the duties of the Chair, but such
                    substitution shall not extend beyond an adjournment. He shall have the right to
                    name any Senator to bear messages to the House.</p>
                <p>7. The President shall, when the Senate is equally divided, give the casting
                    vote.</p>
                <p>8. Thirty one Standing Committees, not to exceed seven members, shall be
                    appointed by the President of the Senate, at the commencement of each session,

                    to take into consideration all petitions, documents and evidence relating to
                    elections, which may be referred to them by the Senate; and each of the other
                    committees shall perform such services, and take into consideration all subject
                    and matters required of them by the Senate.</p>
                <p>10. No Committee shall sit during the sitting of the Senate without special
                    leave.</p>
                <p>11. All questions relating to the priority of business shall be decided without
                    debate.</p>
                <p>12. When any Senator is about to speak in debate, or deliver any matter to the
                    Senate, he shall rise from his seat, respectfully address himself to the
                    question under debate and avoid personality. No Senator shall impeach the
                    motives of any other Senator's vote or argument.</p>
                <p>13. If any Senator, in speaking or otherwise, transgress the rules of the Senate,
                    the President shall, or any Senator may, call him to order; in which case the
                    Senator so called to order, shall immediately sit down unless permitted to
                    explain; and the Senate shall, if appealed to, decide the case, but without
                    debate. If there be no appeal, the decision of the chair shall be submitted to.
                    If the decision be in favor of the Senator called to order, he shall be at
                    liberty to proceed. If otherwise, and the case require it, he shall be liable to
                    the censure of the Senate.</p>
                <p>14. When two or more Senators happen to rise at once, the President shall name
                    who is to speak first.</p>
                <p>15. No Senator shall speak more than twice on the same question without leave of
                    the Senate, nor more than once until every member choosing to speak shall have
                    spoken,</p>
                <p>16. While the President is putting the question, or addressing the Senate, no
                    Senator shall walk across or out of the house, nor when a Senator is speaking
                    shall any entertain private discourse or pass between him and the Chair.</p>
                <p>17. No Senator shall be compelled to vote on any question in the event of which
                    he is immediately and particularly interested, or in any case where he was not
                    present when the question was put, but appearing afterwards he may, by
                    permission, have his name called and vote, provided his vote does not change the
                    result.</p>
                <p>18. Upon a division and count of the Senate, on any question, no Senator without
                    the bar should be counted.</p>
                <p>19. Every Senator why shall be in the House when the question is put, shall give
                    his vote unless the Senate, for special reasons excuse him. But the question of
                    excusing a Senator shall be decided summarily without debate.</p>
                <p>20. When a motion is made and seconded, it shall be stated by the President; or,
                    being in writing, it shall be handed to the Secretary, and then read aloud
                    before debated.</p>
                <p>21. Every motion shall be reduced to writing, if the President or any Senator
                    desire it, endorsed by the Senator introducing it, and the name of the author
                    announced by the Secretary before reading.</p>
                <p>22. After a motion is stated by the President and read, it shall be deemed in the
                    possession of the Senate, but may be withdrawn at any time before decision or
                    amendment.</p>
                <p>23. When a question is under debate, no motion shall be received but</p>
                <list>
                    <item>1st. To adjourn.</item>
                    <item>2d. To lie on the table;</item>
                    <item>3d. For the previous question.</item>
                    <item>4th. To postpone indefinitely;</item>
                    <item>5th. To postpone to a certain day;</item>
                    <item>6th. To commit; or,</item>
                    <item>7th. To amend.</item>
                </list>
                <p>Which several motions shall have precedence in the order which they stand
                    arranged.</p>
                <p>24. When a question is postponed indefinitely, the same shall not be acted upon
                    during the session.</p>
                <p>25. The previous question shall be put in this form: "Shall the main question be
                    now put?" It shall only be admitted when demanded by a majority of the Senators
                    voting and until it is decided, shall preclude all debate, and the introduction
                    of all further amendments. The main question shall be the first question in
                    order, and its effect shall be to put an end to all debate, and bring the Senate
                    to a direct vote on the subsidiary questions then pending, in their order, and
                    then on the main question.</p>
                <p>26. Motions and reports may be committed at the pleasure of the Senate.</p>
                <p>27. Any member may call for the division of a question where the sense will admit
                    of it.</p>

                    be decided by a vote of the Senate.</p>

                    chosen.</p>
                <p>52. It shall be the duty of the Doorkeeper to attend the Senate during its

                <p>53. When a reference is made of any subject to a standing committee, the Senator

                    SESSION.</head>
                <p>1. While Bills and Joint Resolutions are on their passage between the two Houses,
                    they shall be on paper, under the signature of their Clerks respectively.</p>
                <p>2. After a Bill or Joint Resolution shall have passed both Houses, it shall be
                    duly enrolled on paper, and the Clerk of the House where it originated shall
                    indorse upon the back thereof the House in which it originated, under which he
                    shall place his signature.</p>
                <p>3. Every Bill or Joint Resolution, after being enrolled, shall be examined by the
                        <orgName>Joint Committee of Enrolled Bills</orgName>, consisting of three
                    from the Senate and six from the House, appointed as a standing committee for
                    that purpose - one of whom on the Part of the Senate and two from the House
                    shall be sufficient to act, who shall compare the same with the engrossed bill,
                    and correct any errors they may discover, so as to make it agree therewith, and
                    make their report forthwith to their respective Houses.</p>
                <p>4. Every Bill or Joint Resolution reported to have been duly enrolled shall be
                    signed first by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, who shall send the
                    same to the Senate; then by the President of the Senate; after which it shall be

                    to their respective Houses the day of their presentation, which report shall be
                    entered on the Journals of each House.</p>
                <p>5. All Bill and Joint Resolutions shall be signed by the Speaker of the House of
                    Representatives and the President of the Senate, in their Houses respectively
                    when in session, which shall be carefully noted on the Journals of each
                    House.</p>
                <p>6. When any paper or papers, proper to be acted upon by both Houses, shall come
                    before either, the House before which such paper or papers are laid, shall,
                    after acting thereupon, lay it or them before the other House.</p>
                <p>7. In every case of an amendment of a Bill agreed to in one House, and dissented
                    to in the other, if either house shall request a conference, and appoint a
                    committee for that purpose, and the other House shall also appoint a committee
                    to confer, such committee shall, at a convenient hour, to be agreed upon by
                    their chairman, meet in the conference chamber, and state to each other,
                    verbally, or in writing, as either shall choose, the reason of their respective
                    Houses for and against the amendment, and confer freely thereon, and report to
                    each House their proceedings thereon. A <orgName>committee of
                        conference</orgName> shall consist of two members from each House. After

                    to execute the commands or process of the House of which he is an officer, it
                    shall be the duty of the Sergeant-at-Arms of the other House to execute such
                    commands, together with such process as may be directed to him by the presiding
                    officer thereof.</p>
                <p>9. The following Standing Committees, on the part of each House, shall be
                    appointed to act as joint committees:</p>
                <p>A <orgName>Standing Committee on Enrolled Bills</orgName>, to consist of six on
                    the part of the House, and three on the part of the Senate.</p>
                <p>A <orgName>Committee on Public Buildings</orgName>, to consist of three members
                    from each House.</p>
                <p>A <orgName>Committee on State Library</orgName>, to consist of three members from
                    each House.</p>
                <p>A <orgName>Committee on Canal Fund</orgName>, to consist of three members from
                    each House.</p>
                <p>10. In all elections which require a distinct and separate vote of each House,
                    the voting shall be simultaneous in both Houses. No person shall be deemed to be
                    elected in the proper House, making such separate choice, unless he receives a
                    majority of all the votes given in such House. Each House shall, as soon as a
                    choice shall be made on such separate voting, forthwith communicate the same to
                    the other House, and if it shall appear that the House have concurred in their
                    choice of any or either of the persons so voted for, such person or persons
                    shall be deemed and declared duly elected. But if the Houses do not concur in
                    their choice of each and all the officers so to be elected, then, in such case,
                    the two Houses shall, in like manner, forthwith proceed to a second separate
                    choice of the remaining officers so attempted to be elected. But if no
                    concurrence then be had, the two Houses shall, in like manner, proceed to a
                    third separate choice. If the two Houses shall not have concurred in their third
                    separate choice, the two Houses shall proceed to a joint vote <hi rend="i"
                        >instanter</hi>, for the election of such officer or officers as the two
                    Houses may have failed, for want of concurrence as aforesaid, to elect.</p>
                <p>11. In all Joint Conventions and meetings of the two Houses, it shall be
                    incompetent for either House, or the members thereof, or the Joint Convention,
                    to engage in the transaction of any business other than that for which they were
                    so specifically assembled.</p>
                <p>12. When a message is sent to the Senate, or to the House of Representatives, it
                    shall be announced at the door by the Sergeant-at-Arms, or by the Doorkeeper,
                    and it shall be respectfully communicated to the Chair, by the person by whom
                    sent.</p>
                <p>13. Messages shall be sent by such persons as the President of the Senate, or
                    Speaker of the House, may designate for that purpose.</p>
                <p>14. No Bill that shall have passed one House, shall be sent for concurrence to
                    the other, on the last two days of the session.</p>
                <p>15. When Bills which shall have passed one House, are ordered to be printed in
                    the other, a greater number of copies shall not be printed than may be necessary
                    for the use of the House making the order.</p>
                <p>16. No spirituous liquors shall be offered for sale, or exhibited, within the
                    Capitol, or on the public grounds adjacent thereto.</p>

                <head>"The Place to which you Aspire."</head>
                <p>It is awkward for a man to propose himself for any position in the public
                    service: They say: "He goes a candidating" - "He is aspiring." If this is not
                    the case with Mr. A. DRAPIER, of St. Joseph County, in his present asking for
                    the Assistant Clerkship of the House of Representative, it should be understood
                    with qualifications. As an individual, he might perhaps do better without the
                    position than to serve in it. It would be natural to think so almost of any
                    citizen. He says truly, in his announcement to the nominating caucus of the
                    Democratic side, that he desires chiefly to make a good Journal - one that will
                    compare favorably with the standard Legislative Journals of the country. It is
                    for the sake of the service - the good of the public service - that he desires
                    the position.</p>
                <p>Something of the importance of this position may be seen in the Act of Dec. 23,
                    1872, to Regulate certain Matters of Legislative Practice in the two Houses of
                    the General Assembly. It requires a <orgName>committee on the Journal</orgName>
                    of each House, of which the President of one and the Speaker of the other shall
                    be respectively chairman; and these committees are charged to inspect the unread
                    Journals of their respective Houses. - Assuredly, next in importance to the
                    integrity and authenticity of the facts of the record, is the style in which the
                    Journal is recorded, written, spread for the printer and public archives. For
                    there is such a thing as a received parliamentary style.</p>
                <p>Then also, the printing should be done in the best style of the Art Preservative
                    - in honest small pica type - eliminating all unsightly headings and expressive
                    blanks and scabbardings</p>

                    <head rend="center">TOUCHING THE DUTY OF THE SPEAKER.</head>
                    <p>1. The Speaker shall take the Chair every day precisely at the hour to which
                        the House shall have adjourned on the preceding day; shall immediately call
                        the members to order and, on the appearance of a quorum, shall cause the
                        Journal of the preceding day to be read, unless, by a vote of the House, the
                        reading of the same be dispensed with.</p>
                    <p>2. The Speaker shall examine and correct the Journal before it is read. He
                        shall have a general direction of the Hall. He may name any member to
                        perform the duties of Chair, but such substitution shall not extend beyond
                        an adjournment. He shall have the right to name any member to bear messages
                        to the Senate, and to appoint all committees, unless otherwise specially
                        directed by the House, in which case they shall be appointed by vote.</p>
                    <p>3. The Speaker shall preserve order and decorum. He may speak to points of
                        order in preference to other members, rising from his seat for the purpose,
                        and shall decide questions of order, subject to an appeal to the House by
                        any two members, which appeal shall be in writing and signed by the members
                        taking such appeal, and shall clearly state the point of order decided by
                        the Chair, on which appeal no member shall speak more than once, unless by
                        leave of the House.</p>
                    <p>4. The Speaker may state a question sitting, but shall rise to put a question
                        to the vote of the House.</p>
                    <p>5. Questions shall be distinctly put in this form, namely: " As many as are
                        of the opinion that (as the question may be), say aye," and after the
                        affirmative vote is expressed, "as many as are of the contrary opinion, say
                        no." If the Speaker doubts, or a division be called for, the House shall
                        divide: those in the affirmative shall first rise from their seats, and
                        remain standing until they are counted, and afterwards those in the negative
                        in like manner. If the Speaker still doubts, or a count be required, the
                        Speaker shall name two members, one from each side, to tell those in the
                        affirmative and negative, and the result being reported, he shall rise up
                        and report the decision of the House.</p>
                    <p>6. When the yeas and nays are taken upon any question, the names of the
                        members shall be called alphabetically: alter the call of the roll has
                        commenced, and any member has responded to his name, no motion shall be made
                        in reference thereto, or debate had thereon.</p>
                    <p>7. When any vote ia taken by the yeas and nays, the question shall be stated
                        in the following manner, namely: "As many as are of the opinion, that,
                        etc.,will, when their names are called, answer 'aye,' and as many as are of
                        a different opinion, will, when their names are called, answer 'no.'" And
                        when the vote is taken upon the passage of any bill or joint resolution, and
                        when the same may be demanded by the House, the Clerk shall, after the roll
                        has been gone through, first read over the names of those who have answered
                        in the affirmative, and then the names of those who have answered in the
                        negative, in order that if he has made any mistake in noting the answer, or
                        if any member has made a mistake in his answer, the mistake of either may be
                        corrected.</p>
                    <p>8. The Speaker shall vote in all elections, and when the yeas and nays are
                        taken he shall vote, his name being called last; and in case of an equal
                        division, the question shall be lost; and upon all other questions, when the
                            <pb n="10" xml:id="VAA8558-15-012"/> House is equally divided, he shall
                        give the casting vote, or when his vote would make an equal division he
                        shall vote upon the call of any member; and in case of such equal division
                        the question shall be lost.</p>
                    <p>9. All acts, addresses, and joint resolutions shall be signed by the Speaker;
                        and all writs, warrants, and subpoenas issued by the order of the House,
                        shall be under his hand and seal, and signed by the Clerk.</p>
                    <p>10. In case of any disturbance or disorderly conduct in the galleries or
                        lobby, the Speaker (or Chairman of the <orgName>Committee of the Whole
                            House</orgName>) shall have power to order the same to be cleared.</p>

                    <head rend="center">ABSENCE AND CALL OF THE HOUSE.</head>
                    <p>11. No member shall absent himself from the service of the House, unless he
                        have leave, or be sick and unable to attend.</p>
                    <p>12. Seven members, with the Speaker, or eight members in his absence, having

                        as shall be appointed for that purpose.</p>
                    <p>14. When a member shall be discharged from custody, and admitted to his seat,
                        the House shall determine whether such discharge shall be with or without
                        paying fees, and in like manner whether a delinquent member, taken into
                        custody by a special messenger, shall or shall not be liable to defray the
                        expenses of such special messenger.</p>

                    <p>16. Every motion shall be reduced to writing, if the Speaker, or any member
                        request it.</p>
                    <p>17. When a motion is made and seconded, it shall be stated by the Speaker; or

                        before it shall be debated.</p>
                    <p>18. After a motion is stated by the Speaker, or read by the Clerk, it shall
                        be deemed to be in possession of the House, but may be withdrawn at any time
                        before a decision, or amendment.</p>
                    <p>19. No motion, or proposition on a subject different from that under
                        consideration shall be admitted under color of amendment.</p>

                    <head rend="center">OF DECORUM AND DEBATE.</head>
                    <p>21. When any member desires to speak in debate, or deliver any matter to the
                        House, <hi rend="i">he shall rise from his seat</hi>, and respectfully
                        address "Mr. Speaker," and shall confine, himself to the question under
                        consideration,, and avoid personality, nor shall he impeach the motive of
                        any member's vote or argument.</p>
                    <p>22. If any member, in speaking otherwise, transgress the rules of the House,
                        the-Speaker shall, or any member may, call to order, in which case, the
                        member so called to order shall immediately sit down, unless-permitted to
                        explain; and the House shall, if appealed to, decide on the case, but
                        without debate. If there be no appeal, the decision of the Chair shall be
                        submitted to. If the decision be in favor of the member called to order, he
                        shall be at liberty to proceed, if otherwise, he shall not be permitted to
                        proceed, in case any member object, without leave of the house; and, if the
                        case require it, he shall be liable to the censure of the House.</p>
                    <p>23. If a member be called to order for words spoken in debate, the person
                        calling him to order shall repeat the words excepted to, and they shall be
                        taken down in writing at the Clerk's table: and no member shall be held to
                        answer, or be subject to the censure of the House, for words spoken in
                        debate, if any other member has spoken or other business has intervened,
                        after the words spoken, and before exception to them shall have been
                        taken.</p>

                    <p>While the Speaker is putting any question, or addressing the House, none
                        shall walk out of or across the House; nor, in such case, or when a member
                        is speaking, or delivering any matter to the House, shall pass between him
                        and the Chair. Every member shall remain uncovered during the session of the
                        House. No member or other person shall visit, or remain by the Clerk's table
                        while the ayes and nays are being called.</p>
                    <p>25. Every member who shall be in the House when the question is put shall
                        give his vote, unless the House, for special reasons, shall excuse him. All
                        motions to excuse a member from voting shall be made before the House
                        divides, or before the call of the ayes and nays is commenced; and any
                        member requesting to be excused from voting, may make a brief verbal
                        statement of the reasons for making such request, and the question shall
                        then be taken without further debate; and the refusal of a member to vote
                        who is present and has not been excused from voting, will be a high breach
                        of decorum, and will subject the person so offending to a fine, censure, and
                        such other punishment as the House may order and impose.</p>
                    <p>26. No member shall vote on any question in the event of which he is
                        immediately and particularly interested, or in any case when he was not
                        within the bar of the House when the question was put, unless by the consent
                        of the House; and in no case shall such absent member be allowed to vote
                        after the result has been announced, when his vote shall change the decision
                        of the question. For the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present,
                        all members within the House, when the question is stated by the Speaker,
                        and the vote is on a call of the ayes and nays, shall be counted, and such
                        of them as fail to respond to their names when called, shall be noted by the
                        Clerk as present, and not voting. The Hall of the House shall be deemed and
                        held to include the entire chamber in which this body holds its
                        sessions.</p>
                    <p>27. Upon a decision, and count on any question on which the ayes and nays are
                        not demanded or required, no member without the bar shall be counted.</p>
                    <p>28. When two or more members happen to rise at once, the Speaker shall name
                        the <sic>the</sic> member who is first to speak.</p>
                    <p>29. No member shall speak more than twice on the same question without the
                        leave of the House, nor more than once until every member choosing to speak
                        shall have spoken And if a question depending be lost by adjournment of the
                        House and revived on the succeeding day, no member, who shall have spoken on
                        the preceding day, shall be permitted again to speak without leave of the
                        House.</p>

                    <p>30. When a question is under debate, no motion shall be received but to
                        adjourn, to lie on the table, for the previous question, to postpone to a
                        day certain, to commit, amend, or to postpone indefinitely, which several
                        motions shall have precedence in the order in which they are arranged; and
                        no motion to postpone to a day certain, to commit or to postpone
                        indefinitely, being decided, shall again be allowed on the same day, and at
                        the same stage of the bill or proposition. A motion to strike out the
                        enacting words of a bill or joint resolution shall have precedence of a
                        motion to amend, and if carried, shall be considered equivalent to its
                        rejection.</p>
                    <p>31. When a motion is made to refer any subject, and different committees are
                        named, the question shall be taken in the following order: 1. To a
                            <orgName>Committee of the Whole</orgName>. 2. <orgName>Standing
                            Committee</orgName>. 3. A <orgName>Select Committee</orgName>. And if
                        the motion of reference is to different Standing Committees, the question
                        shall be taken in the order in which the committees are named.</p>
                    <p>32. Any member may call for the division of a question, before or ofter the
                        main question is ordered, which shall be divided if it comprehend
                        propositions in subjects so distinct, that one being taken away, a
                        substantive proposition shall remain for the decision of the House. A motion
                        to strike out and, insert shall be deemed indivisible, but a motion to
                        strike out being lost, shall preclude neither amendment nor a motion to
                        strike out and insert.</p>
                    <p>33. The previous question shall be in this form "Shall the main question be
                        now put?" It shall only be admitted when demanded by a majority of the
                        members present, and its effect shall be to put an end to all debate, and
                        bring the House to a direct vote upon a motion to commit, if such motion
                        shall have been made, and if this motion does not prevail, then upon
                        amendments reported by a committee, if any, then upon pending amendments,
                        and then upon the main question. But its only effect, if a motion to
                        postpone is pending, shall be to bring the House to a vote upon such motion.
                        On the previous question there shall be no debate. All incidental questions
                        of order arising after a motion is made for the previous question, and
                        pending such, motion, shall be decided, whether on appeal? or otherwise,
                        without debate. And after a demand for the previous question has been
                        seconded by the House, no motion shall be entertained to excuse a member
                        from voting.</p>
                    <p>34. When a motion has been once made and carried in the affirmative or
                        negative, it shall be in order for any member of the majority to move for
                        the reconsideration there- <pb n="12" xml:id="VAA8558-15-014"/> of, on the
                        same or the succeeding day, and such motion shall take precedence of all
                        other questions, except a motion to adjourn, and shall not be withdrawn
                        after the said succeeding day, without the consent of the House, and
                        thereafter any member may call it up for consideration.</p>
                    <p>35. Any member may change his vote before the result is announced; and
                        afterwards, by leave of the House, provided such change will not effect the
                        result.</p>
                    <p>36. When a question is postponed indefinitely, the same shall not be acted on
                        again during the session.</p>
                    <p>37. When a paper is first presented to the House it shall be a matter of
                        right in any member to have it read, before the House shall vote upon it. If
                        the paper has been once read, or the reading dispensed with, and the reading
                        be again required and objected to, it shall be determined by a vote of the
                        House.</p>

                        respects, been accurately and correctly engrossed; and if such Committee
                        ascertain any mistake, the same shall be corrected under their

                        reports from Committees shall be called for and disposed of, in doing which
                        the Speaker shall call upon each Standing Committee in regular order, and
                        then upon Select Committees. And if the Speaker shall not get through the

                        day.</p>
                    <p>53. After two hours shall have been devoted to reports from committees,

                    <p>55. Bills and Joint Resolutions, out of the regular order, may be introduced
                        on the report of a committee, or by motion for leave, which shall be granted
                        only by a majority of the House.</p>
                    <p>56. The first reading of a bill shall be for information, and if opposition
                        be made to it, the question shall be" Shall this bill be rejected?" If no
                        opposition be made, or if the question to reject be negatived, the bill
                        shall then pass to a second reading unless the House shall otherwise
                        order.</p>

                        question shall be whether to a Select or a Standing Committee, or to a
                            <orgName>Committee of the Whole House</orgName>. If to a

                        determine on what day; if no motion be made to commit, the question shall be
                        stated on its engrossment, and if it be not ordered to be engrossed on the
                        day of its being reported, it shall be placed on the general file on the
                        Speaker's table, to be taken up in order.</p>
                    <p>58. General appropriation bills shall be in order in preference to any other
                        bills of a public nature, unless otherwise ordered by a majority of the

                        of a <pb n="14" xml:id="VAA8558-15-016"/> motion to amend, and, if carried,
                        shall be equivalent to its rejection. Whenever a bill is reported from a
                            <orgName>Committee of the Whole</orgName>, with a recommendation to
                        strike out the enacting words, and such recommendation is disagreed to by
                        the House, the bill shall stand recommitted to the said committee, without
                        further action of the House.</p>
                    <p>60. If any bill or other proposition be referred to a committee, and any
                        members of such committee make a minority report, such report shall be
                        regarded as an amendment to the report of the committee.</p>
                    <p>61. All Bills and Joint Resolutions ordered to be engrossed shall be executed
                        in a fair, round hand</p>
                    <p>62. After commitment and report thereof to the House, or at any time before
                        its passage, a bill may be recommitted to the same, or any other Committee,
                        either with or without instruction. But after a Bill or Joint Resolution has
                        been engrossed and ordered to a third reading, it shall not be amended
                        except by unanimous consent, but may be recommitted, with special
                        instructions, by a two-thirds vote, and should such recommitment take place
                        after its engrossment, and an amendment be reported and agreed to by the
                        House, the question shall be again put on the engrossment of the Bill.</p>
                    <p>63. When a Bill or Joint Resolution shall be put on its passage, and shall
                        receive a majority of the votes cast, but not the number of votes required
                        by the Constitution, the same shall not be considered lost; but when Bills
                        and Joint Resolutions upon their third reading shall be in order, any member
                        who voted with the majority, or who did not vote at all, may call the same
                        up, and the House shall take another vote thereon, and any number of votes
                        may be taken in such cases by the House, but there shall be no debate
                        thereon.</p>
                    <p>64. No bill or Joint Resolution shall, at any time, be amended by annexing
                        thereto, or incorporating therewith, any other Bill or Resolution pending
                        before the House.</p>
                    <p>65. A motion to lay proposed amendments on the table, if they prevail, shall
                        not affect the general subject to which said amendments are offered.</p>
                    <p>66. Members having petitions and memorials to present may hand them to the
                        Clerk; indorsing the same with their names, and the reference or disposition
                        to be made thereof; and such petition and memorial shall be entered on the
                        Journal. And if any petition or memorial be so handed in, which, in the
                        judgment of the Speaker, is not respectful and temperate, and free from
                        offensive imputations upon the character or conduct of the Assembly or other
                        constituted authority, it shall be returned to the member from whom it was
                        received. Any member having any petition, memorial, remonstrance,
                        resolution, bill, or other matter of which he was the mover or introducer,
                        shall have the right to meet with and act as a member of the Committee
                        during the time said Committee may have such subject under
                        consideration.</p>
                    <p>67. No standing rule or order of the House shall be rescinded or charged
                        without one day's notice being given of the motion there-of; nor shall any
                        rule be suspended except by a two-thirds vote.</p>
                    <p>68. No persons except members of the General Assembly and its officers, and
                        members of the Executive and Judicial departments of State, shall be
                        admitted within the north lobby of the hall of the House, without consent of
                        the Speaker.</p>
                    <p>69. The Principal and Assistant Clerks, and their assistants, and the
                        Doorkeeper and his Assistants, shall each, before entering upon the
                        discharge of their respective duties, take an oath to support the
                        Constitution of the United States and of this State, and to faithfully,
                        impartially and honestly discharge the duties of their offices.</p>
                    <p>70. The Clerk shall keep a Journal of the decisions of the Chair, to be
                        inserted at the close of the Journal of the House.</p>
                    <p>71. During the reading of the Journal of the House, no member, officer,
                        employee of the House, whose station is within the bar of the House, shall
                        leave his station or seat, unless he shall have the consent of the House
                        therefor.</p>

                    <p>72. It shall be the duty of the Doorkeeper to attend to the House during its
                        sessions, announce all messages, keep the hall and committee rooms in
                        perfect order; to prevent smoking in the halls and lobbies; to maintain

                            <p>Mr. SLEETH. Mr. President, I am not certain how members look at it,
                                but I am of opinion that this resolution is in violation of an act
                                passed at the last session - An act fixing the per diem of members
                                of the Assembly. That act cuts off all stationery and all other
                                perquisites. If the Statutes are not stationery I <pb n="4"
                                    xml:id="VAA8558-15-022"/> don't know what is, I don't believe we
                                should pass this resolution.</p>
                            <p>Mr. SMITH. I move to lay the resolution on the table.</p>
                            <p>The motion was agreed to.</p>
                            <p>Mr. DAGGY. I offer the following:</p>
                            <p>Ordered, That the Librarian furnish three copies of Revised Statutes,
                                Gavin &amp; Hord, three copies of the Acts of 1869, 1671 and 1873,
                                also Senate and House Journals for the use of the Senate.</p>
                            <p>Mr. SMITH. I would like to inquire whether that resolution is in
                                order, a similar one having just been laid on the table?</p>
                            <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. It is not the same resolution. It is in
                                order.</p>
                            <p>Mr. LARUE. Mr. President: It seems to me that members should have the
                                use of the acts of the Legislature, and it does not seem to me they
                                are or should be regarded as stationery. Possibly I may be able to
                                draft bills as well as any Senator, as I have been somewhat familiar
                                with the laws of the State, but it seems to me it is necessary that
                                members should have the use of the acts. They are not stationery. As
                                the old members of the Senate have received copies of these acts it
                                is not necessary for them to take them. I offered my resolution in
                                good faith. This resolution I am opposed to because it says but
                                three copies. That will not do. I shall go with Senators who favor
                                economy, and shall oppose furnishing writing paper and other things
                                strictly stationery, but I oppose this resolution because it says
                                only three copies.</p>
                            <p>Mr. DAGGY. At the last extra session we required in our resolution
                                that the statutes should be returned, but that amounts to nothing,
                                for, after being used one session members might as well take them
                                home, they are second hand and as far as the State is concerned they
                                are a total loss. It would cost the State from fifteen to twenty
                                dollars for each member. The three set of Statutes with the acts and
                                House journals, will give all the information needed by us as
                                members of the Senate. All measures, particularly those of
                                importance, are passed through the hands of committees, and they
                                will have the revised Statutes, consequently we scarcely ever refer
                                to the revised Statutes, and they are as useless lumber to us; and,
                                therefore, I offered this resolution, intending it to supercede the
                                resolution offered by the Senator from Tippecanoe [Mr. LaRue.]</p>
                            <p>Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN. If I am not mistaken the law provides that not only
                                stationery, but no books shall be furnished to members of the
                                Legislature.</p>
                            <p>Mr. SMITH. I move to lay the resolution on the table.</p>
                            <p>The motion was agreed to.</p>

                                    excess of such sum of $3,00 shall have such excess deducted out
                                    of their pay as members of the present Legislature."
                                    [Laughter.]</p>
                                <p>Mr. HOUGH. I move to lay the amendment on the table.</p>
                                <pb n="7" xml:id="VAA8558-15-025"/>
                                <p>The motion was rejected - yeas 11, nays 38.</p>
                                <p>Mr. HOUGH. The amendment proposes a thing that cannot be done. It
                                    would be utterly impossible to coerce the re payment of money
                                    received by any member of this or any other General Assembly. It
                                    would be only encumbering the bill unnecessarily, and publishing
                                    to the world that we don't know what we are doing, If we are
                                    going to undo a thing, which some of us thought was right and
                                    proper, but which the people say was wrong, let us do it in
                                    earnest. Let us pass the bill as it is, and when that is done,
                                    if the people are not satisfied; and if the State has not money
                                    enough to run the government, let us assess members of the
                                    Legislature to run it.</p>
                                <p>Mr. FRIEDLEY of Lawrence. I am not here to say whether my
                                    amendment is in strict accordance with legal precedent or with
                                    law, but I do not suppose that any member of the Senate, or I
                                    may say of the other branch of the Legislature, requires an
                                    enactment to compel him to do that which he may believe to be
                                    right, or that which he believes the people regard as right I
                                    know my excellent friend from Hancock [Mr. Hough] would not stop
                                    to question the legality of this clause in the bill if it
                                    becomes a law, but would at once cover into the treasury all he
                                    has heretofore drawn, if any, in excess of three dollars a day.
                                    I am sure the Senator, and every other Senator would do that.
                                    Now I say with the Senator from Hancock, if we are going to
                                    reform, let us reform in earnest, and while reforming let us be
                                    just to Senators now here for the first time. If I, as one of
                                    the Senators holding over, have received eight dollars a day for
                                    the last session, is it right that I should ask one of these
                                    gentlemen who come here for the first time to serve for three
                                    dollars per day? I think in this instance justice to the people
                                    and to new Senators require that we should take out of our
                                    pocket th s money the people say does not belong to us and cover
                                    it back into the treasury.</p>
                                <p>Mr. THOMPSON. Why should all this sacrifice fall upon members of
                                    the Legislature? Why not extend it to the State officers and to
                                    the Governor? And then we will all be on a level. I did not vote
                                    for eight dollars a day, but then I don't like to do anything
                                    that don't pay. [Laughter.]</p>
                                <p>Mr. LARUE. I will say to the Senate that I am opposed to the
                                    bill, amendment and all. I am satisfied members are not getting
                                    any more than they ought to receive now. I voted to prevent this
                                    amendment going on the table, in order to render the bill more
                                    ridiculous than it is. I would be in favor of reducing the
                                    number of members of the Legislature to, say twenty-five in the
                                    Senate and fifty in the House, and giving them ten dollars a
                                    day. I would much prefer cutting our session down to four weeks.
                                    It would suit me much better than to sit here during the entire
                                    constitutional term.</p>
                                <p>Mr. DYKEMAN. While I am in favor of reform, I don't propose to
                                    carry it to such an extent as to be ridiculous. If this bill
                                    passes, it will go out to the world that this Senate is losing
                                    its dignity, and that is why I voted for the amendment, that
                                    they might both go together. I think the people will be
                                    satisfied to give us five dollars a day, and I introduced my
                                    bill in good faith.</p>
                                <p>Mr. SLEETH. I move that the amendment be indefinitely postponed.
                                    [Mr. Smith withdrawing his motion.]</p>
                                <p>The motion to indefinitely postpone, was rejected - yeas 14,
                                    nays, 36.</p>
                                <p>Mr. LARUB. I move to indefinitely postpone both the bill and the
                                    amendment,</p>
                                <p>The motion was rejected - yeas 14, nays 36.</p>
                                <p>Mr. DYKEMAN I move to amend the amendment by adding the
                                    following:</p>
                                <p>"No member of the General Assembly shall receive any Railroad
                                    pass during the term for which he was elected, and in case any
                                    member has accepted such pass, he shall cover into the Stare
                                    Treasury the value in Greenbacks or Gold of such pass."
                                    [Laughter.]</p>
                                <p>Mr. BUNYAN. In compliance with a resolution adopted to-day, a
                                    committee was appointed to draft a bill to fix the per diem of
                                    members of the Legislature. I now move to refer this bill with
                                    the pending amendments to that committee.</p>
                                <p>The motion was agreed to.</p>
                                <p>And then the Senate adjourned till ten o'clock to-morrow
                                    morning.</p>

                        <p>This day being the Constitutional day for the meeting of the Forty-ninth
                            General Assembly, the members elect of the House of Representatives came
                            together promptly at ten o'clock a. m., in the Representative Hall of
                            the Capitol in the City of Indianapolis, and were organized according to

                            <p>At the hour of 10 a. m., the SECRETARY OF STATE, using the gavel on
                                thc Speaker's table,said: The hour having arrived for the
                                organization of the House <pb n="8" xml:id="VAA8558-15-026"/> of
                                Representatives, all those persons on the floor who are not members
                                are requested to retire; and members are requested to take their
                                places inside the bar. From the returns which have been made, to the
                                office of Secretary of State, by the Clerks of the various counties
                                and districts, we have prepared a list of the names of gentlemen
                                elected to this body. I will call the prepared roll, and if error be
                                discovered in it, I will be obliged to any for its correction; and
                                as their names are called, gentlemen will please advance to the
                                front area and Judge Downey of the Supreme Court, will administer
                                the oath.</p>
                            <p>Mr. CLARK of Hamilton said: There are a few of us now here with
                                conscientious feeling in this matter - not wishing to swear, and not
                                wishing, as has been the case heretofore with such members, to go on
                                the record as having sworn, and we desire that there should be some
                                provision in the record to show this.</p>
                            <p>The SECRETARY. The Judge is willing and desires to make this
                                distinction. Therefore, those who affirm will remain in their places
                                whilst the roll call is being called, and will afterwards come
                                forward and affirm. I will call the roll in sections of twenty-five
                                names.</p>
                            <p>The roll was then called in the order of the counties and districts,
                                as authorized by the last apportionment for Representatives, and the
                                oath ot office was administered by Judge Downey to all the
                                Representatives elect, except Mr. Harris, of Wayne, he be absent at
                                the time, and Messrs. Jesse Marvin, of Fountain. Cornelius Shugart,

                                Mr. Turpie and conduct him to the speaker's chair.</p>
                            <pb n="10" xml:id="VAA8558-15-028"/>
                            <p>That service being duly performed - the SPEAKER receiving the oath of
                                his office as speaker, at the hand of Judge Downey, stood before the
                                House and said:</p>
                            <p>Gentlemen - For this distinguished mark of your confidence in calling
                                me to preside over your deliberations I return you my sincere
                                thanks.</p>
                            <p>I trust in the attempt which I shall make to discharge the difficult
                                and delicate duties of the Chair, I may depend upon the continued
                                support of your forbearance and partiality.</p>
                            <p>The great and varied interests of the State are, for a season,
                                committed to our care. Let us see to it that we are diligent in the
                                discharge of this trust.</p>
                            <p>The constitutional limit of the session is a brief one. It is
                                therefore to be hoped that gentlemen having legislative measures to
                                propose will call attention to them at as early a day as possible,
                                so that the committees may be at work, and there may be fair and
                                full examination of every subject of importance brought before us
                                for public action.</p>
                            <p>Some changes of the law seem necessary public opinion has recently
                                indicated them. Let them be made as speedily as possible. Let us not
                                be anxious, however, to change or to do too much. Let us rather be
                                careful that what is done is well done.</p>
                            <p>If, without presumption, anything may be hazarded in the way of
                                counsel concerning our action here, it may be this: That the time of
                                the session should not be too much taken up with the discussion of
                                national politics.</p>
                            <p>Our connection as Legislators with those subjects is neither very
                                direct nor very efficient.</p>
                            <p>Very little attention is usually paid at Washington to the
                                traditional resolutions instructing our Senators and requesting our
                                Representatives in regard to their action even when the delegation
                                to Congress is in political accord with the Legislature here, and
                                still less, when it is not so, as is now the case. Discussion is
                                fruitless when the power to act and to determine is wanting. Nor
                                does this detract from the importance of our position. The
                                Legislature of the State ought not only to be the school, but the
                                sphere of the truest and best statesmanship in the country.</p>
                            <p>Let us, then, discourage all unprofitable debate. Let us work hand in
                                hand with a common purpose, to advance, in every possible way, the
                                interests of the State and the welfare of the generous
                                constituencies which have given us their confidence. In this labor
                                Indiana expects every gentleman to do his whole duty.</p>
                            <p>The time of the session is not ours; it belongs to the people. Time,
                                especially in this season of financial difficulty, is money. This
                                time of the people is their money. Let us be conscientiously and
                                rigidly economical in the use of it. Let every hour spent in this
                                hall be thoroughly devoted to the public service.</p>
                            <p>Lest I myself should in this respect be an offender, I will delay the
                                organization of the House no further, except again to thank you.</p>

                            <p>Mr. WYNN. Mr. Speaker, I think if the gentleman will examine into the
                                matter he will find, that there are no rules of the last House of
                                Representatives. That the rules of that body were adopted for the
                                Special Session of 1872. I move to amend so as to adopt the rules of
                                the Special Session.</p>
                            <p>Mr. HELLER, The same rules were used for the Regular Session, without
                                material change, and the same rules were adopted for the Regular
                                Session.</p>
                            <p>Mr. WYNN admitted his statement in part, but insisted on his
                                amendment.</p>

                                <p>Mr. HAVENS. Mr. Speaker, I have prepared the following joint
                                    resolution; and I desire to remark that I do not offer it
                                    without regard to the just remark of the Speaker on taking the
                                    Chair to-day.</p>
                                <p>He then submitted the joint resolution [H. R. No. 1] on the
                                    subject of the Military usurpation in the State of Louisiana,
                                    which was read by the Clerk. [It declares the breaking up of the
                                    General Assembly of that State by Military force, and resolves
                                    for a solemn protest against the wrongs perpetrated by the
                                    administration of the General Government against the sovereignty
                                    of the Southern States.]</p>
                                <p>Mr. FULK. If this resolution is adopted, as a matter of course it
                                    must be regarded as one of the most important acts of the
                                    session. In effect it proposes to decide upon the conduct of the
                                    President of the United States; for we know that the soldiers
                                    now in Louisiana are there by the order of the President. And,
                                    on the very day of organization here, to take the responsibility
                                    of deciding and dictating in such a matter, in my judgment it
                                    would be going further than we should go until we are further
                                    informed of the facts. It is likely that we have all heard these
                                    Louisiana rumors, and the highly colored newspaper accounts of
                                    them. They may also be greatly exaggerated; and it would be
                                    highly improper, it seems to me, therefore, upon such meager
                                    information as we have here, to declare either approbation or
                                    disapprobation of the act of the President of the United
                                    States.</p>
                                <p>The debate was continued by a member whose recognition was not
                                    heard, and Mr. Havens responded.</p>
                                <p>Mr. LANHAM moved to lay the joint resolution on the table.</p>
                                <p>Mr. DAVIS and Mr. LANHAM demanded the yeas and nays; and they

                                <p>These bills were read the first time and severally passed to the
                                    second reading.</p>
                                <p>Mr. FRIEDLEY of Lawrence. As I am informed there is a pressing
                                    necessity for the passage of tins bill, I move for the
                                    suspension of the constitutional restriction that the bill may
                                    be read the second time now.</p>
                                <p>Mr. LARUE. I hope there will be no hasty legislation with regard
                                    to the organization of the courts. My own views and the views of
                                    some other members of the legal profession in this State are
                                    that we should leave the Circuit Courts as they now are, or
                                    nearly so, and entirely separate the civil criminal business in
                                    this State. We and have six criminal Judges, some of whom can do
                                    twice the business they are now doing, and 1 apprehend nine or
                                    ten judges, can do all the criminal business of the State. Any
                                    person who has practiced law for many years, knows that it is a
                                    very great advantage to both judges and litigants to separate
                                    the criminal and civil business: and that the criminal business
                                    seriously interferes with the civil business on account of the
                                    precedence given it by law. All I ask in regard to this matter
                                    is that we have no hasty legislation on this subject, and that
                                    we may see if we cannot together devise a better mode.</p>
                                <p>Mr. GOODING. I concur in the wish expressed by the Senator from
                                    Tippecanoe [Mr. LaRue] that there shall be no hasty legislation
                                    on this subject. I know in many parts of this State they need
                                    legislation, and by taking up separate bills we are apt to spoil
                                    any system that might be gotten up. I do not exactly agree in
                                    the proposition to separate the civil and criminal business of
                                    the courts. In my part of I the State they desire something in
                                    the nature of a Superior Court. I cannot conceive of any
                                    emergency for the passage of this | bill at the present time. I
                                    think it better to wait awhile, and consider the wants of all
                                    parts of the State, and let one bill comprise the whole
                                    subject.</p>
                                <p>Mr. FRIEDLEY, of Lawrence. I find on my table a paper signed by a
                                    number of the citizens of Hamilton county, in which some very
                                    strong reasons are assigned for an emergency. I do not desire
                                    the bill to pass this evening: I only desire the bill may be
                                    read the second time now, and referred to a committee with a
                                    view of acting in the future intelligently and understandingly
                                    on this bill. I have had conversations with some intelligent and
                                    distinguished citizens of Hamilton county during the forenoon,
                                    and they tell me that the necessity for passing this bill is
                                    urgent, I heartily unite with the Senator from Tippecanoe, [Mr.
                                    LaRue] and the Senator from Vanderburg, [Mr. Gooding,] in
                                    deprecating hasty legislation, but I beg them to bear in mind
                                    that we are not now asking the passage of this bill.</p>
                                <p>A provision in section 18, article IV of the Constitution, of the
                                    State, requiring the consent of two-thirds of the members
                                    elected to the Senate (to be ascertained by a vote of yeas and
                                    nays,) before any bill can be read twice on any one day; the
                                    yeas and nays were ordered, and being taken resulted - yeas 33,
                                    nays 12.</p>
                                <p>So, two-thirds of the Senate not voting therefore, the
                                    Constitutional restriction was not dispensed with, and the bill
                                    was passed to the second reading.</p>

                            <p>The SPEAKER now took up the call of the roll of Counties and

                            <p>Mr. MARTIN, of Adams and Wells, submitted an order (which was

                            <p>Mr. WILLIAMS, of Bartholomew and Brown, introduced a bill [H. R. 22]
                                to amend the fees and salaries act of March 8, 1873 [In sections 4,

                            <p>Mr. CANTLEY introduced a bill [H.R.34] making it the duty of the

                                respective counties, certain certified copies of records effecting

                                of the Secretary of State, and the office of the Commissioners of
                                the Wabash and Erie Canal, to be kept for examination as other

                            <p>Mr. WATERMAN submitted an order instructing the Doorkeeper to make no

                                this House till further orders. He said: The object is to keep the
                                control of the expenses for stationery with the House. It now rests
                                with the Doorkeeper. I think we had better keep it under our own
                                control.</p>
                            <p>Mr. HELLER showed by the act of the regular session of the
                                Legislature of 1873, that the law requires such necessary books,
                                stationery, etc., to be furnished by the State officers, and that it
                                also repeals the "stationery" section of the per diem bill of the
                                special session of 1872.</p>
                            <p>Mr. WYNN cautious about misunderstanding here, said: I do not think
                                that the law should be construed so that officers and members here
                                may have stationery which they may take away from the building.</p>
                            <p>Mr. WATERMAN now asked and obtained leave to withdraw the

                                able to meet the committee on the part of the Senate, and asked and
                                obtained leave to act independently of that portion of the
                                committee.</p>
                            <p>Mr. FORKNER introduced a bill [H. R. 25] defining certain
                                misdemeanors, and prescribing punishment therefor. [Fine of $50 and
                                ten days imprisonment for drunkenness, and unlawful selling of
                                liquor.]</p>
                            <p>Also, the bill [H. R. 26] in relation to, and prescribing some of the

                                receive funds paid into Court under the order of the Judge - the
                                County Commissioners to determine the amount of the Clerk's bond on
                                account of this provision.]</p>
                            <p>Mr. WOODY introduced a bill [H. R. 27] amending an act entitled am
                                cat to fix the per diem of members of the General Assembly. [Per
                                diem five dollars, and 20 cents per mile mileage.]</p>
                            <p>Mr. SHAFFER introduced bill [H. R. 28.] compelling parents and
                                guardians to educate their children and wards.[For a period of at

                                <p>Mr. GOSSMAN, of Dubois, considered that one thousand five hundred
                                    copies in German, would not be sufficient, and proposed to amend
                                    by inserting two thousand five hundred copies in German.</p>
                                <p>Mr. HAVENS. Twenty-five hundred in English, and the same number
                                    in German would be out of proportion to the two classes of
                                    citizens. The original resolution for one thousand five hundred
                                    copies in German out of the order for five thousand would be a
                                    more just proportion.</p>
                                <p>Mr. TAYLOR, of Tipton, was of the ame opinion, and opposed the
                                    amendment.</p>
                                <p>Mr. CALDWELL also considered the original resolution nearer the
                                    correct thing ban it would be with the proposed amendment. At
                                    least five thousand copies of so important a paper should be
                                    printed, and one thousand five hundred of these in German would
                                    be a large proportion; it would be a very fair and liberal
                                    portion for the German population.</p>
                                <p>Mr. GOSSMAN. My amendment is for the two thousand five hundred
                                    copies in German, additional to the five thousand copies in
                                    English.</p>
                                <p>Mr. WYNN. I propose as an amendment to the amendment that there
                                    be printed two thousand copies in English and one thousand in
                                    German. He reminded the House that the message would be printed
                                    in the newspapers, and generally read through that
                                    circulation.</p>
                                <p>Mr. BURS ON moved ineffectually to lay the amendment to the
                                    amendment on the table; and the question recurred on its
                                    adoption.</p>
                                <p>Mr. DAVIS. The proposition is to reduce the number from five
                                    thousand to three thousand. It appears to me that, in view of
                                    the importance of the message - in view of the fact that it is a
                                    very full and complete review of our public affairs - it appears
                                    to me that five thousand copies is not out of the way. It is a
                                    fact also, that a great many people will read the message, if
                                    they receive it in a pamphlet, who would not read it in a
                                    newspaper; and there are many who are not likely to receive it
                                    in any other way. I am willing to take the original
                                    proposition.</p>
                                <p>Mr. TRUSLER. The amendment to the amendment will furnish each
                                    member with thirty copies and that is sufficient. The
                                    Legislature should economize in this as in other things.</p>
                                <p>Mr. MARVIN, of Boone. To show a proper respect for the Governor -
                                    that respect which is shown to all Governors five thousand is
                                    little enough. The cost can be but little more than for three
                                    thousand. I am opposed to the amendment, through distinctly in
                                    favor of retrenchment. While you have the types set up for three
                                    thousand copies, you might as well print five thousand.</p>
                                <p>Mr. GOSSMAN asked and obtained leave to withdraw his
                                    amendment.</p>
                                <p>Mr. WYNN'S amendment was then rejected; and the original
                                    resolution was adopted.</p>

                            <p>The bills were read the first time, and severally passed to the

                            <p>Mr. DYKEMAN moved that the constitutional restriction be dispensed
                                with so that his bill [S. 33] for an act to defray the Expenses of
                                the General Assembly may be advanced to its final reading.</p>
                            <p>A constitutional provision requiring the yeas and nays, they were
                                ordered, and being taken resulted - yeas 42, nays 4.</p>
                            <p>So the motion was agreed to, and the bill [S. 33] was read the second
                                time.</p>
                            <p>Mr. SARINGHAUSEN moved that the bill be considered as engrossed, read
                                the third time, now, and put upon its passage.</p>
                            <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR ordered the Secretary to call the roll.</p>
                            <p>Mr. GIVAN. Will not one vote to suspend the constitutional rule,
                                answer for both readings?</p>
                            <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. That has been the practice in the other end
                                of the capitol, but for my own part, I do not believe it is in
                                compliance with the constitutional requirement. I think the
                                constitutional restriction should be suspended by vote of yeas and
                                nays every time a bill is read more than once on the same day. I
                                know the contrary has been the practice in the other end of the
                                capitol, but it is condemned by the best authorities.</p>
                            <p>Mr. SLATER. Even if that was the rule, it would not apply in this
                                case, for the motion did not contemplate two readings.</p>
                            <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. The way I put it, it did, but it requires
                                just as much of a suspension of the constitutional rule now to read
                                it the third time as it did to read it the second time. Call the
                                roll.</p>
                            <p>The notion [Mr. Sarnighausen's] was agreed to - yeas, 45, nays,
                                2.</p>
                            <p>So the constitutional restriction was again dispensed with, the bill
                                [S. 33] for an act appropriating $125,000 to defray the expenses of
                                the forty-ninth General Assembly of the State of Indiana, was read
                                the third time, and finally passed the Senate by yeas, 45, nays,
                                1.</p>

                            <p>Mr. DAGGY. I offered a resolution a while ago to find out at what
                                price the morning papers could be had, to accommodate members of the
                                Senate. This resolution would make it obligatory upon us to pay for
                                them. I think it better for each member to subscribe for the paper
                                he wants.</p>
                            <p>Mr. GIVAN. I move to lay the resolution on the table.</p>

                                willing, however, that the resolution shall lay over till

                                            liquors, according to the principles of the Democratic
                                            platform adopted in July, 1874. in the city of

                                            possible.</p>

                            <p>Mr. KENNEDY of Montgomery. There is at least one very serious
                                objection to one of the recommendations of Governor Hendricks on
                                this subject, and that is his recommendation that the buyer of
                                liquor as well as the seller shall be punished. This, in Mr. K's
                                opinion, would effectually suppress all evidence of the violation of
                                any good liquor law. For example, if the selling is to a minor,
                                according to the Governor's recommendation, the minor must be
                                punished. But you can't make a witness of a minor. Still, in any
                                case, if this recommendation in the Governor's message is adhered
                                to, he would like gentlemen to tell where they will get the evidence
                                on which to found a prosecution; for a party cannot be compelled to
                                convict himself. He saw not how we could get along with these cases
                                without soliciting for the witness the party which is generally
                                regarded as the least culpable.</p>
                            <p>Mr. DAVIS. In the organization of the committees of the House, it is
                                understood that they act independently and separately: and when you
                                attempt to require two committees to act as one upon any given
                                subject - I submit whether it is not an infringement upon the
                                practice of the House, if not a violation of the rules?</p>
                            <p>The SPEAKER. It is certainly against the practice of the House; but
                                the Chair can not say that it is a violation of the rules.</p>
                            <p>Mr. DAVIS would suggest then to his friend, the mover of the
                                resolution [Mr. Reno,] that it would be better simply to direct his
                                resolution to the <orgName>Committee on Temperance</orgName>. That
                                committee is perhaps able to take care of the subject. The
                                resolution is all well enough; we should perhaps, have some
                                expression in regard to the matter, before the bill is prepared.</p>
                            <p>Mr. RENO. His object was to have the <orgName>Temperance
                                    Committee</orgName> get up the bill, and that its technical and
                                constitutional intricase be considered by the <orgName>Committee on
                                    the Judiciary</orgName>. However he accepted the modification
                                and called for the yeas and nays on the resolution.</p>
                            <p>The vote resulted - yeas 51, nays 48.</p>
                            <p>So the resolution was adopted.</p>

                            <p>Mr. HAVENS submitted a motion to take up his joint resolution [H. R.
                                1,] on the subject of military usurpation in the State of
                                Louisiana.</p>
                            <p>The motion was agreed to and the joint resolution was taken up and
                                read.</p>
                            <p>Mr. CHARTERS. I move that the joint resolution be referred to the
                                    <orgName>Committee on Federal Relations</orgName>.</p>
                            <p>Mr. HAVENS hoped that course would not be pressed. If ever there was
                                a time in the history of this country, when State Legislatures ought
                                to give expression against the innovations of popular rights and
                                civil liberty, it is such a time and such a day as that referred to
                                in this resolution. When it was first offered last week, gentlemen
                                said they would like to have time to consider to look into the
                                facts,they did not want to be pressed: and the House acquiesced. But
                                now, if gentlemen have read the correct history of the late events
                                in New Orleans, they must be prepared to vote an expression of their
                                views and feeling in the matter that should be heard throughout the
                                length and breadth of the land. It is undeniable that the facts and
                                circumstances evince that an outrage has been committed upon
                                constitutional government. The people of Louisiana have been goaded
                                to desperation, and may have done wrong; but there is no
                                justification for the administration in this case. The whole case is
                                one of simple, unvarnished history. The question at issue is so
                                plain, that the conduct of the administration is not definable from
                                any standpoint. When such men as William M. Evarts, and William
                                Cullen Bryant come to the front to denounce? <pb n="28"
                                    xml:id="VAA8558-15-046"/> it, as an oppression and outrage, we
                                may well follow them. It has also been said by the Governor of
                                Indiana, that no court, and much less, no military powers have the
                                right to go back of the decision of a deliberative body of
                                Representatives of the people, to say who shall or who shall not sit
                                and deliberate as its members. He (Mr. H.) would call this
                                transaction in Louisana a High crime and misdemeanor. One for which
                                the administration should be held to a strict account to the people.
                                It was not merely an outrage, but a crime against the liberties of
                                the people. If the President had sent down his armed soldiery, and
                                thrust out the members of this Legislature, the case would have been
                                precisely parallel. This outrage and crime was as unexpected as it
                                is monstrous and alarming. It simply marks the footsteps by which
                                the Republican party proposes to retain and maintain its position
                                and power.</p>
                            <p>Gen. Phil. H. Sheridan, says in a letter, that he was not on command
                                on the 4th of January, and that letter has received various
                                comments. The people of the city of New York met that night to
                                condemn his acts and his letter, in which he asks that the people of
                                Louisiana be denounced as but a body of white leagues and banditte.
                                If he understood the facts, the case was the reverse of the general
                                statement, that the people of Louisiana were worthy and law abiding
                                citizens. But the General asks that they may be declared as
                                banditte, and leave the rest to him and his orders of a commander,
                                who, perhaps, is thirsting for blood.</p>
                            <p>Gen. Sheridian has been a good soldier, just as (Mr. HAVENS) himself
                                had been in a small way, but when he asks for such a declaration and
                                such proceedings against the people of Louisiana, he brands himself
                                with infamy. On this question it seemed to him that there would not
                                be found a man to stand up for and support the conduct of this
                                administration.</p>
                            <p>Mr. CHARTERS understood that we have committees to attend to these
                                matters, and the House should wait for their action. As to the facts
                                alleged in the joint resolution, a large portion of us here do not
                                believe a word of these reported outrages, and we ask but that the
                                resolution may go through the usual forms of deliberation, that it
                                may be referred to the proper committee and fairly considered there,
                                and that so we may have the benefit of their deliberate report. He
                                commended the soldierly character of Gen. Sheridan, and reminded
                                gentlemen, that we represent here, not Louisiana, but the affairs of
                                the people of Indiana.</p>
                            <p>Mr. TRUSLER regarded this debate as a waste of time. The time
                                Representatives are consuming here belongs to the people of Indiana,
                                and it seemed to him that this resolution was dragged in here for no
                                higher purpose than to enable politicians to waste the time and
                                money of the people by ventilations of their views of national
                                politics. He was not here to legislate for the State of Louisiana,
                                or to sit in judgment or pass sentence upon Gen. Grant or Gen.
                                Sheridan. If this were our business, he could see nothing in it but
                                good room for precious time to be squandered.</p>
                            <p>Mr. PFAFLIN. What we can understand of this matter now must be
                                gathered only from the vague discussions of the newspapers. There is
                                a Congressional committee on this matter not yet heard from, and he
                                should vote that the resolution go to the <orgName>committee on
                                    Federal Relations</orgName>.</p>
                            <p>Mr. DARNALL was not prepared for the introduction of such a
                                resolution so soon after the organization, especially since the
                                speaker deprecated such propositions as unprofitable legislation. He
                                heartily concurred in that remark in the Speaker's address, and had
                                hoped that it would be an index to the course of the majority of
                                this House. But there are special reasons why we should not adopt
                                this resolution. We know not what is the state of facts in
                                Louisiana, and we have no power, like the Congress of the United
                                States to send a committee there. We might spend the entire session
                                upon this question without coming to any just conclusion. One
                                gentleman reads one class of newspapers and another reads another
                                class, and in the end, when we compare all our notes derived from
                                these sources of information, we shall know no more about this
                                matter than when we began. He was as distinctly in favor of popular
                                rights as any man, but before voting on this resolution he wanted to
                                know from New Orleans whether they are suppressing popular rights or
                                popular rascality. Another reason against spending time about this
                                resolution is the very short period to which the session is limited.
                                We all have bills requiring consideration, besides those for the
                                general public appropriations. And if we had not these things
                                pressing upon us, still we have not the time to do justice to such a
                                subject as this resolution furnishes, and even if we had nothing
                                else to do it might be better for us to let it alone. Congress has
                                this matter properly in hand, and they have or have had a committee
                                there in Louisiana. They are also able to take care of the case. For
                                these reasons, as well as others that might be readily suggested, he
                                would oppose all such propositions, and should now vote that the
                                resolution go to the committee indicated by the motion of the
                                gentleman from Miami, [Mr. Charters] and if the facts are <pb n="29"
                                    xml:id="VAA8558-15-047"/> found to be infamous as the resolution
                                alleges, he should vote for it.</p>
                            <p>Mr. BURSON could not understand how anything done by the people of
                                Louisiana has anything to do with this question. This question is
                                all in the fact that the Legislature of Louisiana, has been
                                suppressed by the military of the United States, and the Government
                                of the United States had no right to do that. The newspapers say
                                that <sic>that</sic> Legislature was taken possession of by the
                                military force of the United States. Every newspaper all over the
                                country says that; and it is sufficient for us to know that the
                                Representatives of the people of Louisiana have been trampled upon
                                by the military. He was sorry to hear Republican members oppose the
                                passage of this resolution, for, if the President intends to trample
                                the liberties of the people under foot, they are the party to have
                                their say about it, and the friends of Gen. Grant should be the
                                first to denounce such an act. It is simply a question of liberty,
                                for the rights of free Government have been trampled upon. The
                                Republican party have set themselves up as teachers of the people.
                                They have been the schoolmaster that taught us what liberty means;
                                they freed four millions of negroes, and now, (he contended) it is
                                not right - it is unjust and unworthy for these gentlemen to go back
                                on a resolution of this kind. The resolution should not be
                                referred.</p>
                            <p>Mr. CALDWELL. As to the waste of time deprecated by the gentleman
                                from Howard, [Mr. Darnall,] Mr. C. undertook to say that no time of
                                this session could be better spent than in the consideration of the
                                resolution offered by the gentleman from Vigo, [Mr. Havens.] Do not
                                gentlemen know that the State of Indiana has the right to instruct
                                her Senators and Representatives in Congress in regard to such an
                                outrage? He cared not if it take to discuss this resolution - was in
                                favor of taking the time, - because it is one of the most important
                                measures introduced here. Indeed, there seems to be no difference of
                                opinion in this whole country in relation to the character of the
                                outrage that has been perpetrated against the rights of the people
                                of Louisiana. There has been a public meeting held in Fanuel Hall -
                                the old cradle - and there been meetings held all over the country,
                                in which resolutions of denunciation have been directed against that
                                outrage. The State of Louisiana has been theater of oppressions on
                                the part of General Government, and it is time people were freed
                                from it. There is no better settled principle of free Government
                                than this: That the Legislature of the people has the right to
                                determine the election and qualification of its own members. Then is
                                it right that such a question as that involved in this resolution
                                should be smothered? The House should make a record to-day, one way
                                or' the other, in regard to this matter.</p>
                            <p>Mr. CRUMPACKFR demanded the previous question but did not urge
                                it.</p>
                            <p>Mr. KENNEDY, of Montgomery, had hoped that nothing would be thrown in
                                here to hurt the feelings of gentlemen that ought to get along
                                harmoniously. As has been said, we have a National Congress whose
                                duty it is to take care of measures of this kind; the State of
                                Indiana has an able delegation there; and he was in favor of leaving
                                this question with them, because that body has full power to settle
                                it, and we have not. The gentleman from Vigo [Mr. Havens] says that
                                General Grant ought to be impeached for this business in Louisiana.
                                In reply to that, he read a paragraph from Greeley's History of the
                                Great Conflict, to the effect, that the Legislature of the State of
                                Kansas, under the Free State (Lecompton) Constitution met in session
                                on the Fourth of July r 1856, but they were not allowed to organize,
                                Col. Sumner having dispersed them by order of President Pierce.
                                Ought President Pierce to have been impeached for that act? But
                                wherein was that a very different thing from this Louisiana
                                business? In Kansas, Col. Sumner, acting under the slave-driver's
                                whip, disperses a free State Legislature - disperses them by the
                                military, by the direct order of President Pierce. Ought President
                                Pierce to have been impeached for that act? No; Pierce did his duty;
                                and Grant has done precisely what Pierce did precisely what the
                                Constitution required him to do. He then looked into the General
                                Constitution and read the clause which requires the National
                                Government to guarantee to every State a republican form of
                                Government,and that the nation should defend the State against
                                domestic violence. Has there not been a case of domestic violence in
                                Louisiana? That cannot be denied. It would be monstrous, then, if
                                the President of the United States would stand aside and refuse to
                                suppress domestic violence in Louisiana. Gentlemen forget that there
                                was no legislative body organized in Louisiana. It was a mob that
                                was dispersed. Who has disputed the fact that Republicans elected a
                                majority of the Louisiana Legislature? Who has denied the fact that
                                the Democratic members elect had not enough to organize? It was a
                                mob then that was dispersed <pb n="30" xml:id="VAA8558-15-048"/> by
                                the military. He, as earnestly as any man, is opposed to military
                                interference with civil power. But it is not becoming here to
                                express sympathy with lawlessness. To do such a thing would be to
                                ally ourselves with the lawless. He had no sympathy with those who
                                will not submit to law. He would not vote to sensure President Grant
                                or Philip Sheridan for what they have done in Louisiana. They have
                                done nothing but what the defence of law and order requires. There
                                can be no requirement for haste in this matter, and if there has
                                been an outrage committed, it is wiser to carefully determine the
                                facts before the censure.</p>
                            <p>Mr. FORKNER deprecated this discussion because it could have little
                                effect on the General Government, and it was a waste of time. He
                                however denied the allegation that there had been military
                                in-fringment of the civil authority in Louisiana. But we do know
                                that there was rebellion and bloodshed in New Orleans last summer -
                                rebellion against the de facto government of Louisiana, which
                                required the interference of the military; and here again, lately,
                                the military were called upon to disperse men who were of the
                                minority of the House of Representatives in Louisiana, and who were
                                seeking to usurp the authority of the Legislature of that State. In
                                the name of the people and of the spirit of economy, which has given
                                so many members^their places in this House; he protested against
                                this waste of time here, to make personal records.</p>
                            <p>Mr. MARVIN of Boone, hoped this Joint resolution would be allowed to
                                pass to the third reading without further opposition. The
                                Republicans had said the most - so far they had been about two to
                                one, and he had something himself to say; but he preferred a demand
                                for the previous question. He however withheld the demand for</p>
                            <p>Mr. LANHAM, who concurred with those who regarded this decision as a
                                waste of time. He deprecated excitement, and hoped the resolution
                                would be I committed. No doubt the <orgName>Committee on Federal
                                    Relations</orgName> were competent to the discussion of this
                                matter, and would make a just report.</p>
                            <p>Mr. HELLER regarded the cause, of the people of Louisiana as the
                                cause of the people of every State in the Union. Gentlemen say that
                                this is not our business, but the business of Congress. He insisted
                                that it was precisely a question upon which we should be heard. We
                                know what has been done, and if there has been oppression and
                                usurpation, it is our duty to raise our voices against it, and in
                                favor of the sufferers.</p>
                            <p>Mr. CRUMPACKER renewed his demand for the previous question but there
                                was no second.</p>
                            <p>Mr. KENNEDY, of Morgan, showed that, at least there could be nothing
                                wrong in studying such a question as this before acting upon it.</p>
                            <p>Mr. DAVIS stated the facts in the organization of the Louisiana House
                                of Representatives, detailing all the steps in that matter. Now,
                                whether these steps were regular or irregular, what right had the
                                military to interfere and pretend to usurp the right to decide who
                                were members of that legislative body? That question belongs to the
                                body itself. It was a fundamental right of self-government. The
                                resolution states plainly the infraction of this right by the
                                military, under the order of the President, and he was in favor of
                                action upon it.</p>
                            <p>Mr. WOODY could not allow the occasion to pass without stating his
                                views against the hasty action sought to be taken on this
                                resolution. He alleged that the conservative presiding officer of
                                the pretended body was the first to call for the interference of the
                                military; and upon this and other matters he predicated his
                                conclusion, that, at least, for the present, there is no pressing
                                occasion for the resolution.</p>
                            <p>Mr. JOHNSON, of Carroll, did not want to see this resolution go to
                                the committee. Free representative government had been broken down
                                in Louisiana sister State, and it was not right that we should delay
                                or hesitate to raise our voice against it.</p>
                            <p>The motion to refer was rejected, without a division; and then the
                                joint resolution was ordered to be engrossed for the third
                                reading.</p>
                            <p>Mr. DARNALL asked and obtained leave to introduce a bill [H. R. 44]
                                for an act to authorize the County Commissioners of their respective
                                counties of the State to purchase all the books, stationery, etc.
                                for their county officers and the Circuit and Inferior Courts, and
                                to punish County Commissioners for speculating on such
                                purchases.</p>
                            <p>Mr. MARTIN, of Wells, introduced a bill [H. R. 45] for an act to
                                regulate and license the sale of malt, spiritous, vinous and other
                                intoxicating liquors, prescribing penalties, modes of prosecution,
                                and repealing all former laws on the subject.</p>

                            <p>Mr. BOONE submitted a resolution directing the committee on the
                                organization of courts of justice to inquire into the expediency of
                                dividing the State into criminal circuits, and establishing criminal
                                courts therein; and, also, of requiring when a case is at issue that
                                the parties thereto shall elect whether the trial shall be by court
                                or jury, and if by jury to have it set down for a day certain, and
                                to so arrange all trials that they shall be disposed of in
                                succession.</p>
                            <p>Mr. BOONE. I do not know how it is throughout the State generally,
                                but in the courts where I have been called to practice, I find that
                                indictments by grand juries are being found during the term, bench
                                warrants are sent out and persons charged with crime are being
                                brought in and by the statute they are entitled to trial at the
                                expense of civil business. It is sometimes the case that a single
                                criminal charge will take up a whole week, thus demoralizing the
                                civil docket set down weeks before. The civil business is compelled
                                to stand still at a great sacrifice until the criminal business is
                                disposed of, and juries are seriously demoralized by the difference
                                in instructions given by the court in criminal cases, and in civil
                                cases. In one case they are instructed that they must be the judges,
                                both of law and fact, and in the other, that they are simply judges
                                of the fact, and must take the law as the court gives it to them. It
                                is astonishing to learn the confusion in the minds of jurors on this
                                subject after being in the presence of the court for five weeks.
                                That tends to demoralize justice, I have no doubt. My feeling was,
                                two years ago, that it would be better to divide the civil and the
                                criminal practice. The business is more confused in our courts than
                                it was before the change. I do not know that the plan proposed in my
                                resolution is best, but I desire to present it tor the consideration
                                of the committee.</p>
                            <p>Mr. SLATER, I demand the yeas and nays in order to get the sense of
                                the Senate on this question,</p>
                            <p>Mr. HOUGH, said: I desire to say, before the vote is taken on this
                                resolution that so far as my observation and experience goes the
                                evils complained of by the Senator from Boone (Mr. Boone) do not
                                exist to any considerable extent in my part of the State. Under the
                                admirable system of rules adopted for the transaction of business in
                                my circuit, the business of our court was never so promptly,
                                satisfactorily and economically done. The first week of each term is
                                devoted to probate business - the formation of the issues in civil
                                causes and the disposal of causes on default. The second week, in
                                which the jury first appears for the term the criminal causes are
                                taken up and disposed of, so far as they may be. The third and
                                fourth weeks are occupied in the trial of civil causes, each of
                                which is set down for trial by the court at the time the issues are
                                perfected therein; and the witnesses are then subpoened. And the
                                times for the trial of causes by the court and jury respectively,
                                are so fixed that when a jury is absent from the court room
                                deliberating upon their verdict in a cause the judge takes up and
                                disposes of one or more of, the causes submitted to the court tor
                                trial without the intervention of a jury.</p>
                            <p>I believe that if the judges of the other circuits in this State
                                would substantially adopt and be governed by the rules of our
                                circuit and display the energy and promptness which characterizes
                                the labors of our judge, there would be but little if any cause of
                                complaint in any circuit.</p>
                            <p>Two years ago there was pending in this body a series of bills, the
                                objective points of which were: first, the abolishment of the Common
                                Pleas Court; secondly, the increase of the number of circuits and
                                circuit judges, and thirdly, the increase of the salary of the
                                circuit judges. I then opposed all of those measures for the reason
                                that I believed if they should be adopted and then the Common Pleas
                                system should be revived either in the same or a different name the
                                result would be a large increase in the expenditure of the State for
                                judicial purposes. I predicted, in explanation of my vote on the
                                passage of the bill, establishing our present judicial system that
                                there would be an effort in less than five years, to re-establish
                                the old system or inaugurate a new one, which would cost the State
                                of Indiana at least $150,000 per annum more than ever before and it
                                seems my prediction was true. Our present system has operated much
                                better than I apprehended, and judging from my stand point, there is
                                no necessity for establishing a criminal court or making any radical
                                change.</p>
                            <p>Mr. BELL. Residing in a county in which we have a criminal court, and
                                not feeling the full force of the evils referred to by Senators, yet
                                having practiced in other courts, I have observed the troubles
                                referred to, and I think there should be <pb n="36"
                                    xml:id="VAA8558-15-054"/>some plan provided to obviate them. If
                                a change of venue is taken from our court, it is almost a matter of
                                impossibility to get the case tried, and there is trouble in the
                                disposition and management of probate business, which forms with us,
                                as important a branch of jurisprudence as any other, and it is
                                almost utterly neglected. The court has not time to advise itself as
                                to the condition of these matters, and for that reason, I offer an
                                amendment to the resolution: that said committee inquire into the
                                expediency of establishing a surrogate system for the disposition of
                                probate business, the Judges to be paid from fees, taxed in such
                                cases, to be their own clerks, etc.</p>
                            <p>Mr. FRIEDLEY, of Lawrence. I am opposed both to the original
                                resolution and the amendment. Our judicial system is already
                                sufficiently expensive, and these propositions would increase still
                                further the expense. There comes up a voice from every county in
                                this State, asking the Legislature not to increase the number of
                                officers, but, if possible, to decrease them.</p>
                            <p>Mr. BEARSS. I, too, am opposed to the resolution. It seems to be the
                                object to increase the number of Judges and officers, and if that is
                                allowed, it will be but a short time I fear before Judges will be
                                more numerous than colonels and captains. [Laughter.] I am opposed
                                to it because it will add greatly to the expense.</p>
                            <p>Mr. LARUE. 1 am in favor of the adoption of the original resolution,
                                but opposed to the amendment. I am in favor of keeping down expenses
                                where they can be, but the expense of courts will be largely
                                diminished by furnishing to the people, justice without delay. We
                                should have enough Judges to do justice to the people, and it is
                                possible we may be able to remedy existing evils without increasing
                                the number of Judges.</p>
                            <p>Mr. SLEETH. I offer the following amendment to the amendment:</p>
                            <p>"And further, that such surrogate Judge be ex-officio president of
                                the Board of County Commissioners."</p>
                            <p>Mr. BELL. I accept the amendment.</p>
                            <p>Mr. SLEETH. There is, perhaps no body in the State which transacts as
                                much important business for the people, as the Board of County
                                Commissioners, and there is none so incompetent. Whatever kind of
                                amendment we make to the judicial system there ought to be some kind
                                of a balance wheel provided for the County Commissioners' court.
                                There are two kinds of economy. It is just as well for the people to
                                pay the same amount ot money in salaries, and have their business
                                transacted properly and speedily, as to pay out twice the amount of
                                money that should be paid to witnesses, if a proper system were
                                adopted. This resolution is simply one of inquiry, and no Senator is
                                bound by his vote on it.</p>
                            <p>Mr. NEFF. Two years ago when the change was made, I was opposed to
                                it, and said I believed it would not give satisfaction. I am now in
                                favor of making this inquiry, for I believe a better plan could be
                                devised, and one that would not necessarily cost any more than the
                                present system.</p>
                            <p>Mr. RHODES. I happen to be one of the members of this Senate who
                                opposed the judiciary change two years ago. Now, as was predicted at
                                that time, the proposition is to organize another court, or extend,
                                a court already organized in some of the counties, to every part of
                                the State. There are already Criminal courts in those counties which
                                have a large amount of criminal business, and is it not true, that
                                they furnish the measure of relief herein asked for? The trouble
                                seems to be with the manner in which the Judges dispose of their
                                business. We have no trouble in the county where I live, hence, I do
                                not believe if the committee were to report a bill that it would
                                furnish the desired relief. I have no objection to a law prescribing
                                the manner in which the business of the court should be managed, but
                                I think it unnecessary to take up the time of the Senate in
                                investigating the subject proposed, and I therefore move that the
                                resolution and amendment lie on the table.</p>
                            <p>The motion was agreed to by yeas 28, nays 18.</p>
                            <p>Pending the vote -</p>
                            <p>Mr. GOODING said: I do not wish to commit myself to any proposition
                                by the vote I now give.</p>
                            <p>Mr. PEED: It is evident to my mind, that in some localities relief
                                should be granted, but whether that relief should be by creating
                                this Criminal Court, or adopting some other system, I do not now
                                desire to commit myself.</p>
                            <p>Mr. SKINNER, when his name was called, expressed his opposition to
                                the measure because it proposed to increase the cost of the judicial
                                system.</p>
                            <p>Mr. SMITH adopted the sentiment just expressed by the Senator from
                                Vanderburg [Mr. Gooding.]</p>
                            <p>Mr. STOCKSLAGER, when his name was called, said: I do not desire by
                                the vote I shall give upon this motion to commit myself to any
                                system. As has been said, it is evident that relief is demanded in
                                some parts of the State. While I think the change adopted two years
                                ago was wise, <pb n="37" xml:id="VAA8558-15-055"/>it was not to be
                                expected that the system could have been made perfect at once. I am
                                opposed to creating any new circuits, but I think our court system
                                can be made much more perfect by changing the circuits. We have no
                                trouble except that our Judge is overworked. Our business is
                                transacted much better than under the old system. The only change we
                                desire is that one of our large counties be taken off and some
                                smaller county added, thereby making less work for our Judge.</p>
                            <p>The vote was announced as above.</p>
                            <p>So the resolution lies on the table.</p>

                                    reported the following: [The same in force last session except a
                                    change in the last clause of rule 38.]</p>
                                <p>1. The President shall take the chair every day precisely at ten
                                    o'clock in the forenoon, and two o'clock in the afternoon,
                                    unless the Senate shall, by motion, have adjourned to some other
                                    hour appointed by such motion. He shall immediately call the
                                    Senators to order; and, on the appearance of two-thirds, shall
                                    cause the journal of the preceeding day to be read.</p>
                                <p>2. Nine Senators with the President, or ten in his absence,
                                    having chosen a President <hi rend="i">pro tem</hi>., shall be
                                    authorized to call a Senate, compel the attendance of the absent
                                    Senators, make an order for their fine or censure and may
                                    adjourn.</p>
                                <p>3. The President shall preserve order and decorum, may speak to
                                    points of order in preference to Senators, rising from his seat
                                    for that purpose; and shall decide questions of order, subject
                                    to an appeal to the Senate, by any two Senators, on which appeal
                                    no Senator shall speak more than once, unless by leave of the
                                    Senate.</p>
                                <p>4. The President shall rise to put a question, but may state it

                                    Aye," and after the affirmative voice is expressed, "as many as
                                    are of the contrary opinion, say No," If the President doubts or
                                    a division be called for, the Senate shall divide; those in the
                                    affirmative of the question, shall first rise from their seats,
                                    and afterward those in the negative.</p>
                                <p>6. The President shall have a general direction of the Senate
                                    Chamber. He shall have the right to name any Senator to perform
                                    the duties of the Chair, but such substitution shall not extend
                                    beyond an adjournment. He shall have the right to name any
                                    Senator to bear messages to the House.</p>
                                <p>7. The President shall, when the Senate is equally divided, give
                                    the casting vote.</p>
                                <p>8. Thirty one Standing Committees, not to exceed seven members,

                                    without special leave.</p>
                                <p>11. All questions relating to the priority of business shall be
                                    decided without debate.</p>
                                <p>12. When any Senator is about to speak in debate, or deliver any
                                    matter to the Senate, he shall rise from his seat, respectfully
                                    address himself to the question under debate and avoid
                                    personality. No Senator shall impeach the motives of any other
                                    Senator's vote or argument.</p>
                                <p>13. If any Senator, in speaking or otherwise, transgress the
                                    rules of the Senate, the President shall, or any Senator may,
                                    call him to order; in which case the Senator so called to order,
                                    shall immediately sit down unless permitted to explain; and the
                                    Senate shall, if appealed to, decide the case, but without
                                    debate. If there be no appeal, the decision of the chair shall
                                    be submitted to. If the decision be in favor of the Senator
                                    called to order, he shall be at liberty to proceed. If
                                    otherwise, and the case require it, he shall be liable to the
                                    censure of the Senate.</p>

                                    President shall name who is to speak first.</p>
                                <p>15. No Senator shall speak more than twice on the same question
                                    without leave of the Senate, nor more than once until every
                                    member choosing to speak shall have spoken.</p>
                                <p>16. While the President is putting the question, or addressing
                                    the Senate, no Senator shall walk across or out of the house,
                                    nor when a Senator is speaking shall any entertain private
                                    discourse or pass between him and the Chair.</p>

                                    event of which he is immediately and particularly interested, or
                                    in any case where he was not present when the question was put
                                    but appearing afterwards he may, by permission, have his name
                                    called and vote, provided his vote does not change the
                                    result.</p>
                                <p>18. Upon a division and count of the Senate, on any question, no
                                    Senator without the bar should be counted.</p>
                                <p>19. Every Senator why shall be in the House when the question is
                                    put, shall give his vote unless the Senate, for special reasons
                                    excuse him. But the question of excusing a Senator shall be
                                    decided summarily without debate.</p>
                                <p>20. When a motion is made and seconded, it shall be stated by the
                                    President; or, being in writing, it shall be handed to the
                                    Secretary, and then read aloud before debated.</p>
                                <p>21. Every motion shall be reduced to writing, if the President or
                                    any Senator desire it, endorsed by the Senator introducing it,
                                    and the name of the author announced by the Secretary before
                                    reading.</p>
                                <p>22. After a motion is stated by the President and read, it shall
                                    be deemed in the possession of the Senate, but may be withdrawn
                                    at any time before decision or amendment.</p>
                                <p>23. When a question is under debate, no motion shall be received
                                    but</p>

                                    they stand arranged.</p>
                                <p>24. When a question is postponed indefinitely, the same shall not
                                    be acted upon during the session.</p>
                                <p>25. The previous question shall be put in this form: "Shall the
                                    main question be now put?" It shall only be admitted when
                                    demanded by a majority of the Senators voting and until it is
                                    decided, shall preclude all debate, and the introduction of all
                                    further amendments. The main question shall be the first
                                    question in order, and its effect shall be to put an end to all
                                    debate, and bring the Senate to a direct vote on the subsidiary
                                    questions then pending, in their order, and then on the main
                                    question.</p>
                                <p>26. Motions and reports may be committed at the pleasure of the
                                    Senate.</p>
                                <p>27. Any member may call for the division of a question where the
                                    sense will admit of it.</p>
                                <p>28. No new motion or proposition shall be admitted under color of
                                    amendment, as a substitute for the motion or proposition under
                                    debate.</p>
                                <p>29. When a motion has once been made and carried in the
                                    affirmative or negative, it shall be in order for any Senator of
                                    the majority to move a reconsideration thereof, on the same or
                                    any other day during the session but such motion can be
                                    entertained but once during the same session.</p>
                                <p>30. When the reading of a paper is called for, if any objection
                                    is made it shall be decided by a vote of the Senate.</p>
                                <p>31. The unfinished business in which the Senate was engaged at
                                    the last preceeding adjournment shall have the preference in the
                                    orders of the day, and no motion or any other business shall be
                                    received without special leave of the Senate until the former is
                                    disposed of.</p>

                                    succeeding day, no Senator who shall have spoken twice on the
                                    proceeding day, shall be permitted again to speak without
                                    leave.</p>
                                <p>33. Petitions, memorials, and other papers addressed to the
                                    Senate may be presented by the President, or by any Senator.</p>
                                <p>34. A motion to adjourn shall always be in order, except when the
                                    previous question is pending, and shall be decided without
                                    debate. The question pending on adjournment shall be resumed on
                                    re-assembling unless otherwise ordered by the Senate.</p>
                                <p>35. It shall be in order for the <orgName>committee on

                                <p>36. Every bill shall be introduced by motion on leave, or by
                                    order of the Senate.</p>
                                <p>37. Every bill shall receive three several readings in the
                                    Senate, previous to its passage, and all bills shall be
                                    dispatched as they were introduced unless in case of
                                    urgency.</p>
                                <p>38. The first reading of a bill shall be for information, and if
                                    opposition be made to it, the question shall be: Shall the bill
                                    be rejected? If no opposition be made, or the question to reject
                                    is negatived, the bill shall then, if no motion be made to the

                                <p>39 Upon the second reading of a bill the President shall state
                                    that it is ready for commitment, amendment or engrossment: and
                                    if committed then the question shall be; Whether to a select or
                                    standing committee or to a <orgName>Committee of the Whole
                                        Senate</orgName>? If to a <orgName>Committee of the Whole

                                    upon the second reading, and shall then, with the amendments
                                    proposed, if any, be read through by sections.</p>
                                <p>40. Every report of a committee upon a bill, which shall not be
                                    considered at the time of making the same, or laid on the table

                                <p>Mr. FRIEDLEY, of Lawrence, called up his concurrent resolution,

                                    Joint Convention of the two Houses, for the purpose of electing
                                    a State Librarian, Prison Directors and Asylum Trustees.</p>
                                <p>Mr. BELL and Mr. HARNEY, moved to amend the resolution by
                                    providing for the election of two Directors of the Prison,
                                    south, instead of one - the first to succeed B. F. Hill, and the
                                    second to succeed Jno. Kirk.</p>
                                <p>Mr. FRIEDLEY thought there could be no question, but that only
                                    one is to be elected; for in a communication from the Secretary
                                    of State, that is stated to be a fact.</p>
                                <p>Mr. HORFEY recited the history of <sic>he</sic> case; coming to
                                    the conclusion, as a matter of law, of right and of policy, all
                                    blended together, that there are two vacancies to be filled in
                                    the Directorship of the Southern State Prison.</p>
                                <p>Mr. FRIEDLEY moved to lay the amendment on the table.</p>
                                <p>The motion was rejected - yeas 23, nays 25.</p>
                                <p>Messrs. DAGGY and THOMPSON explaining that the amendment will do
                                    no harm, while it is a necessary one if the views of the Senator
                                    from Montgomery, [Mr Harney,] are correct.</p>
                                <p>Mr. SMITH moved to refer the resolution and amendment to Messrs.
                                    Harney, LaRue and Friedley, of Lawrence, with instructions to
                                    report the law in the case.</p>

                        <p>On motion of Mr. COLLINS, the reading of the journal of yesterday was

                        <p>Mr. HARPER, obtaining leave for the purpose, introduced a bill [H. R. 92]
                            for an act compelling railroad corporations to fence their tracks, and
                            providing penalties, which was read and passed to the second

                            <p>On motion of Mr. HAVENS, his joint resolution [H. R. 1] was taken up
                                and considered on its final passage.</p>
                            <p>Mr. TRUSLER demanded the previous question, but withdrew it for -</p>
                            <p>Mr. HAVENS, who said he took the floor in no spirit of
                                spread-eagleism. A great deal that has been said here, such as the
                                charge of wasting the time of the House he would not stop to answer.
                                But there were some things in the debate on this resolution the
                                other day which he desired to set himself right about. The gentleman
                                from Montgomery, (Mr. Kennedy,) was eloquent in praise of his party,
                                boasting that they had feed four millions of slaves. Then the
                                gentleman went off to Kansas to notice the dispersion of an unlawful
                                assembly there, as a parallel to this in Louisiana, and the
                                gentleman also asked Mr. H. where he stood when he was elected here.
                                His position then and now were the same on such a question, as the
                                resolution contemplates. It is his position that when the President
                                of the United States sends his armed soldiery to disperse a State
                                Legislature, he does an infamous thing, and ought to be impeached
                                for it. At the time of the military interference to which the
                                gentleman referred, Kansas was not a State, but a territory. There
                                was a Territorial Legislature called at Lecompton, but the pretended
                                State Legislature to which the gentleman referred, was held out
                                somewhere else. It was an unlawful assembly that President Pierce
                                dispersed - a pretended State in a Territory. But in Louisiana, it
                                is the case of a State with original rights. The gen- <pb n="49"
                                    xml:id="VAA8558-15-067"/> tleman compares the breaking up of an
                                unlawful attempt to usurp the functions of a State Government in a
                                Territory, with the act of military interference with the
                                Legislative authority of a State by turning certain of its members
                                out of their places.</p>
                            <p>Another gentleman said that the Speaker of the House in Louisana was
                                himself first to call for the interference of the military. The fact
                                was that the Speaker asked that military officer to go to the mob in
                                the lobby and disperse them, as they ought to have been, for the
                                disturbance they were making; and that mob in the lobby was
                                comprised of Republicans - political friends of the gentleman. The
                                President had no right to inquire into the legality of the election
                                of members there.</p>
                            <p>Let gentlemen meet us fairly on this question as to the right of the
                                military arm to go into a Legislative body and declare as to who
                                shall be entitled to seats there. Let them not talk about loyalty
                                and the spirit of rebellion. For two years the Congress of the
                                United States has been afraid to face this question. For two years
                                the people of Louisiana have borne the oppression of a pretended
                                government which has been thrown upon them by military force. Let
                                not gentlemen drag out and hold up any more those bloody-bones and
                                shake them in the faces of the people. The question is simply
                                whether the Federal Government has the right to forcibly enter the
                                Legislative halls of a State, and unseat its members; and it cannot
                                be covered up by any side issue. The time is past, to drag in
                                questions in regard to the war, and slavery and violence, and
                                lawlessness in the South on all occasions. Admit that there have
                                been ugly scenes and bad actions in Louisiana - that has nothing to
                                do with the present question. The responsibility for the most of
                                these must forever rest with the minority of this House, and their
                                friends.</p>
                            <p>Mr. KENNEDY of Morgan replied. It was not claimed anywhere that the
                                Legislature of Louisiana was organized under the laws and
                                constitution of that State. Then what is the condition of things? It
                                must be that <sic>that</sic> body was organized in the spirit of
                                revolution. Dibble's letter asserts that for the last two years
                                there has been no government in the State of Louisiana - that they
                                were in a state of revolution. Then what was the duty of the Federal
                                Government? It was to put down revolution. And what was done to the
                                men that were forced into that Legislature by revolution as members
                                of it, was right. A man went in there, assuming the Speaker's Chair,
                                when he had no authority to do so; and a number of members left and
                                attempted to organize another Legislature. It would be a similar'
                                case, if such a thing were done in the Legislature of Indiana, if a
                                minority of the members here had unlawfully proclaimed a Speaker in
                                defiance of the lawful authority to organize this House. Such an
                                attempt would have been a revolutionary and riotous act It is true
                                that Dibble concludes in his letter, that there has been no fair
                                election in Louisiana; and if gentlemen will read both sides they
                                cannot avoid coming to the same conclusion. As for himself he would
                                like to get upon middle ground on this question - get out of the way
                                of both sides. Democrat papers charge the wrong upon the
                                Republicans, and Republican papers charge the wrong upon the other
                                party. Doubtless both may be wrong; but where there is so much smoke
                                there must be some fire. Gentlemen here should be careful not to do
                                injustice. We cannot pass this resolution without bringing upon
                                ourselves a very grave responsibility. And after all, what signifies
                                a party in the comparison with the good of the country? If the party
                                or the Country is to be sacrificed, he would say at all times: Let
                                the party be sacrificed.</p>
                            <p>Mr. TRUSLER now insisted upon the demand for the previous question,
                                and there was a second: and the main question, Shall the joint
                                resolution pass? being ordered and taken resulted - yeas 59, nays 37

                                    Houses had an informal meeting after the adjournment this
                                    morning, and they desire to be instructed on that subject. A
                                    like resolution will be introduced in the House of
                                    Representatives, asking instructions from that body, and we
                                    desire each member to vote as he will vote in the future when
                                    bills on this subject shall come up for consideration. We think
                                    there will be no trouble in agreeing upon the main features of a
                                    temperance bill, if we can settle this question of local
                                    option.</p>
                                <p>Mr SMITH. I would prefer that the resolution should be passed
                                    over until all Senators shall be present, and then have the yeas
                                    and nays called on it.</p>
                                <p>Mr. NEFF. Yes, I would like that.</p>
                                <p>Mr. BOONE demanded a call of the Senate.</p>
                                <p>The call of the Senate having been taken discovered but 37
                                    Senators present and answering to their names.</p>
                                <p>Pending the roll call, leaves of absence were obtained for Mr.
                                    Rhodes, and Mr. Skinner, till next week.</p>
                                <p>Mr. BOONE very much desired that this proposition should be laid
                                    over until there is a full Senate.</p>
                                <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. I have no doubt but that is the wish of
                                    the Senator who introduced the resolution, for it involves,
                                    perhaps,the gist of the whole temperance question.</p>
                                <p>Mr. BOONE. It is useless for these committees to spend the
                                    session, or one half of it, in the preparation of bills that
                                    will not pass.</p>
                                <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. Does the Senator desire to make a
                                    motion?</p>
                                <p>Mr. BOONE. I move it lie on the table till Monday.</p>
                                <p>Mr. BELL. I move to amend by making it Wednesday of next week at
                                    2 o'clock. We will all be here then.</p>
                                <p>Mr. BOONE. My only objection to that is the delay. The committee
                                    desire to be at work.</p>
                                <p>Mr. SLEETH. Several Senators have already got leave of absence,
                                    and I know of others who desire to go home and who cannot get
                                    back by Monday afternoon. If this is to be a test vote it had
                                    better be taken when the Senate is full, for a vote when the
                                    seats are but half filled will be no test at all. I would like
                                    to see the amendment of the Senator from Allen (Mr. Bell)
                                    accepted.</p>
                                <p>The amendment was agreed to, and the resolution as amended was
                                    adopted.</p>

                                    of Husbandry in my county. There are several Senate committees

                                    gaining nothing by remaining in session, the committees have
                                    more work on hand than they will probably be able to do in a
                                    week. New members may object to early adjournments, but I want
                                    Senators to understand, that when we have any business to do I
                                    am in favor of doing it, but really, we are out of business
                                    now.</p>

                                    has brought suit against the Railroad company; and, with that
                                    state of facts, he supposed the House has nothing now to do with
                                    it.</p>
                                <p>Mr. BENCE moved that the resolution be postponed; which he
                                    subsequently withdrew.</p>
                                <p>Mr. FORKNER preferred an amendment instructing the Attorney
                                    General to report the facts. He made that motion.</p>
                                <p>Mr. BEARSS withdrew the motion to refer: the amendment making it
                                    directory to the Attorney General was adopted; and then the
                                    resolution as amended was adopted.</p>
                                <p>Mr MORGAN introduced a bill [H. R. 132] for an act to prevent the
                                    indiscriminate shooting into wild pigeons when they are nesting,
                                    and fixing a penalty therefor, and declaring an emergency.</p>
                                <p>He also presented the petition of certain citizens of Hendricks
                                    county for the passage of this bill.</p>
                                <p>Mr. HORN introduced a bill [H.R. 133] for an act to regulate the
                                    sale of real estate and personal property for purposes of
                                    taxation, providing for the election of Assessors and fixing
                                    their compensation. [County assessors to be elected for six
                                    years, and Township assessors for two years- in the

                                <p>Mr. KENNEDY of Marion submitted a motion, ineffectually, to lay
                                    it on the table.</p>
                                <p>Mr. COLLINS introduced a bill [H. R, 134] for an act to amend an
                                    act to amend the 17th section of an act providing for the
                                    organization of county Boards, and prescribing some of their
                                    duties, approved June 17, 1852, and March 4, 1869. [County
                                    Boards may borrow money to the, extent of one per cent of the
                                    assessment value of county property.]</p>
                                <p>Mr. DARNALL presented the memorial of the County Commissioners,
                                    Township Trustees and Justices of the Peace of Clark county
                                    against the passage of Mr. Davis' bill [H. R. 86] for the
                                    abolition of the Floyd and Clark Criminal Circuit; which was

                                <p>Mr. KENNEDY of Marion introduced a bill [H. R. 136] for an act to
                                    provide for the speedy collection of money due to laborers from

                                <p>Mr. DAVIS accepted the modification; and moved that the

                                <p>Mr. CALDWELL. The duties of the <orgName>Committee on Ways and

                                <p>Mr. LANHAM. No doubt both these committees need a clerk or
                                    secretary; but it becomes us to be economical - with all
                                    deference to the views of the Chair and gentlemen he objected to

                                Lawrence's concurrent resolution for the election of two Director's
                                for the Southern State Prison, and Mr. Harney's proposed ammendment
                                thereto, (see page 25 of these reports,) with a report that they
                                have examined this subject; that the two vacancies shown have
                                occurred in the Board of Directors of said Prison, to be filled by
                                the Legislature, but that there is great doubt thrown upon this
                                matter and the disposition to be made of it by the action of the
                                Legislature of 1873. Two Directors were chosen in 1873, but who is
                                to suceed W.W. Curry and which R. S. Heiskeil is the question in
                                doubt. The report shows that the Senate Journal and the House
                                Journal for the same session, states the same transactions, in
                                different terms and the entry of the declaration of elections of
                                each House is Consistent with the entry of the nominations.</p>
                            <p>Mr.LaRUE. In reporting upon this matter, we simply submitted the
                                facts in the case. The difficulty grows out of the action of the
                                Legislature in the year 1873. The Senate Journal of proceedings in
                                joint convention names one man for the long term, and the House
                                Journal of the same proceedings names another;which is to have the
                                preference is the question. It seems to me that there should be some
                                legislation to get rid of this difficulty. There is no action
                                recommended by the committee.</p>
                            <p>Mr. HARNEY. Around the record as it appears in the Journals of the
                                two Houses it is impossible to go. Both records are equally
                                conclusive in law, yet stating facts diametrically opposed to each
                                other. This makes a state of affairs that seems difficult to
                                overcome. It is evident to my mind that these records have been
                                tampered with in one House or the other. It would not be fair to
                                suffer both these gentlemen t continue in office, especially while
                                it would seem that they or some of their friends in some way or
                                other, have tampered with the record. The matter must be got through
                                some way, and I think we should elect two directors.</p>
                            <p>Mr. WILSON [interposing.] With the <pb n="63" xml:id="VAA8558-15-081"
                                /> gentleman's permission, I will more that this whole matter be
                                referred to the Attorney General.</p>
                            <p>Mr. HARNEY. I do not think the Attorney General can decide a question
                                where the records are diametrically opposed to each other. I see no
                                other way to settle the question than by Legislation or some
                                arbitrary manner.</p>
                            <p>Mr. SMITH. I move to refer this matter back to the committee with
                                instructions to prepare a bill that will obviate this difficulty. I
                                insist that the gentlemen who had this matter in hand, should arrive
                                at some conclusion; and if legislation is needed, let them present a
                                bill, that will cover the case.</p>
                            <p>Mr. SLEETH. As stated by the Senator from Montgomery, [Mr. Harney]
                                there is a conflict between the records of the two Houses. The
                                Journal of the House hows one state of facts, and the Journal of the
                                Senate shows another in reference to the same transaction. Both
                                cannot be true. It seems to me the only way to get the facts in the
                                case, where the records do act show the truth, is to take the sense
                                and recollection of those who were present at the lime, and throw
                                that in with the Journal that supports and corroborates such
                                testimony, and act upon that. This committee might proceed in that
                                way.</p>
                            <p>Mr. LaRUE, [interposing.] Where do we get authority to take outside
                                testimony to correct the Journal if we found it wrong?</p>
                            <p>Mr. SLEETH. It would not be correcting the Journal, but ascertaining
                                a fact which one Journal shows and another contradicts. We can act
                                upon the truth, although our Journals may show that which is not
                                true.</p>
                            <p>Mr SMITH. Let the committee take the papers and report a bill to
                                remedy the evil, and, if necessary, send for persons and for
                                persons.</p>
                            <p>Mr. LARUE. I do not think it will be necessary to Send for persons
                                and for papers. We can't change the evidence. We could abolish the
                                office and get rid of it in that way, but is it desirable? It seems
                                to me the easiest way to get rid of this matter is to require that
                                two be elected at the next session of the Legislature, and one now.
                                I do not think we can take outside testimony to determine a question
                                where we have conclusive evidence The evidence is the record in the
                                journals. It is conclusive; and having conclusive evidence both
                                ways, how are we to decide? It is positive that Mr. Hill was elected
                                for four years, and just as positive that Mr. Munson was, when one
                                ought to have been elected for four years and one for two years.
                                Suppose we enact a law declaring that one of these men are not in
                                office, would the Supreme Court pay much attention to it? Had we
                                better not avoid litigation by electing one now and two at the next
                                General Assembly?</p>
                            <p>Mr. SCOTT. The Journal can't declare how long an officer is elected
                                for. It is the succession that - controls, and if you can make out
                                the succession that is all you want to know.</p>
                            <p>Mr. BELL. Does the journal show one or two vacancies?</p>
                            <p>Mr. LaRUE. Both journals show two vacancies, but the difficulty is
                                not there.</p>
                            <p>Mr. DYKEMAN. It is clear to my mind that there are two vacancies,
                                then why fill but one? We should decide this question, and not leave
                                it to the courts. If we adopt the resolution of the gentleman from
                                Lawrence [Mr. Friedley] we will hold a man in office two years
                                longer that he was elected for. Let's stand by the record we have
                                made. Possibly the House will find out that our record is right.
                                Shall we allow ourselves to raise a question as to the correctness
                                of our own record, simply because some other body has made a
                                different? I never heard of any <hi rend="i">nunc pro tunes</hi>
                                going into legislative bodies before. That is a new thing. Now I am
                                in favor of standing by our own record, and I am much more in favor
                                of doing it from the fact that the message of the Governor shows
                                that there is something rotten, in that Denmark on the Ohio river.
                                Hence I think the amendment of the Senator from Montgomery [Mr.
                                Harney] should prevail.</p>
                            <p>Mr. FRIEDLEY, of Lawrence. The Senator from Cass [Mr. Dykeman] says
                                the effect of my resolution is to continue the term of an officer
                                two years beyond the time for which he was elected. I would like to
                                know where the Senator gets the authority for making that assertion?
                                I understand that both these gentlemen were commissioned for the
                                term of four years less than two years ago. Then is it true that my
                                resolution proposes to continue a man in office after his term of
                                office has expired? Until there is some legal proceeding had showing
                                their commissions were improperly issued, I take it that these
                                officers would hold, and I take it that it is not the effect of my
                                resolution to continue an officer in office after his term
                                expires.</p>
                            <p>Suppose we elect two Directors and the contested case is taken to the
                                courts. If the plaintiff succeeds, he must succeed by a
                                preponderance of evidence. He brings in one Legislative journal to
                                show that he is the successor of Mr. Hill; and the defendant brings
                                in the other journal show <pb n="64" xml:id="VAA8558-15-082"/> ing
                                the opposite. One carries with it just as much weight as the other,
                                and so the plaintiff fails because he has no preponderance of
                                evidence. I think the Senator from Montgomery [Mr. Harney] is right,
                                when he says there should be some legislation to settle this
                                question. - I have no doubt, indeed, I am informed that the original
                                minutes, taken by our assistant Secretary are still in existence,
                                and if they show on their face that there have been no interlination
                                or erasures, it will be strong evidence that our record is correct I
                                believe, under all the circumstances that this resolution should be
                                referred back to the committee.</p>
                            <p>Mr. HARNEY asked and obtained leave to substitute for his amendment
                                the following; - differing only in phraseology: - "By inserting:
                                Elect two Directors for the State Prison, south, one to succeed John
                                Kirk, and the other to succeed a vacancy that may occur"</p>
                            <p>Mr. LaRUE. Is it customary to elect an officer to fill a vacancy,
                                that we see no provision of law which is likely to occur?</p>
                            <p>Mr. HARNEY. It is to elect to fill the first vacancy that may
                                occur.</p>
                            <p>The motion [Mr. Smith's] to refer the motion back to the Special

                                promptly passed by this General Assembly. Our courts have acted upon
                                the assumption that such is now the law, but he Supreme Courts has
                                indicated recently, that its decision would be to the contrary; and
                                inasmuch as large sums of money are being continually paid into

                            <p>Mr. JOHNSTON, of Parke. Senate bill No, 68 to amend the assignment
                                law, has been reported back from the <orgName>Judiciary
                                    Committee</orgName>, and with the consent of the Senate, I would
                                like to take it up and put it on its passage. It is to amend the
                                10th section of the assignment act. As the law now stands, in sales
                                of real estate, the trustee has no power to extend a credit beyond
                                nine months. This bill provides that the court having jurisdiction,
                                may order a private sale when it can be sold at its appraised value,
                                and extend the credit on the last payment to two years.</p>
                            <p>The bill was read the second time; and, under a dispensation of the
                                constitutional restriction, - yeas 39, nays 4, it was read the third
                                time, and finally passed the Senate by yeas 42, nays 0.</p>

                                <p>He said: I desire to say with regard to this matter that, of
                                    course the provision of five hundred dollars is intended for the
                                    benefit of the widow and minor children. I have found cases,
                                    where within a few days or even hours, of the death of the
                                    father, the mother has died, leaving sometimes, three or four
                                    children, all of them under ten years of years of age, where the
                                    creditors would come in and take the entire estate. Very often
                                    it is a small estate and the children become subjects of
                                    individual charity, and are soon sent to the public poor house.
                                    I know of at least three cases in my district, where children
                                    were left absolutely without any provision for their maintenance
                                    by this accidental death of their mother, when if she had lived,
                                    there would have been five hundred dollars in her hands for the
                                    support of her minor children. I submit this as a matter of
                                    inquiry to this honorable committee.</p>

                        <p>The SPEAKER directing the order of prayer by Rev. Mr. Dean, and the

                            <p>Mr. HELLER submitted a motion to reconsider the vote of yesterday,
                                adopting Mr. Davis' resolution, authorizing a Secretary for the
                                    <orgName>committee on the Judiciary</orgName>, and
                                    <orgName>committee on Ways and Means</orgName>. He was not
                                opposed to granting the clerical aid to the committees, but the
                                action on its face was to avoid the terms of the law, and besides,
                                because we have no contingent fund, we cannot pay for the service of
                                these clerks.</p>
                            <pb n="67" xml:id="VAA8558-15-085"/>
                            <p>Mr. DAKNALL. We must have these clerks. It was the argument of
                                necessity. The pay could be provided for by law.</p>
                            <p>Mr. HELLER'S object was simply to get at the service in the legal
                                way.</p>
                            <p>Mr. LANHAM stated the presumption that we can get along at present
                                without these additional clerks.</p>
                            <p>Mr. HAVENS. We have two things here standing as principles - one is
                                to be economical; the other, to keep the law.</p>
                            <p>The Republicans passed this law 2 years ago, and he was informed that
                                they did not heed it. He referred to the fact that the Speaker then
                                had a clerk, (and perhaps our Speaker ought to have one now,) but
                                how he was paid he did not know. Their act, however, is not any
                                warrant for us. One thing is certain, we should not let it go to the
                                country that we are avoiding the law by using the word
                                "Secretary."</p>
                            <p>Mr. KENNEDY, of Montgomery, was here to stand up for good pay for the
                                service ot members, and with equal earnestness he should insist that
                                members do their work promptly and well. Believing that we can get
                                along without more clerks for the present, he would oppose the
                                reconsideration.</p>
                            <p>Mr. JOHNSON, of Carroll, was decidedly in favor of the
                                reconsideration, and opposed to all shifts of ingenuity to avoid the
                                law.</p>
                            <p>Mr. DAVIS had stated yesterday the principle that every legislative
                                body has the inherent power to employ every needful assistance,
                                whether in the House or on the committees. There is no question
                                about this, either in law or in any other way. But if it is the
                                desire of the House that these committees have no clerks, he would
                                like to have it distinctly expressed, and if that vote of yesterday
                                be reconsidered, as it probably would be, he gave notice of
                                amendment to the resolution by which we might'have that clear
                                expression of the House.</p>
                            <p>Mr. HELLER made the point again, that we have no contingent fund out
                                if which to pay for the proposed service. Let us have a law in this
                                case so that we can get at the matter without difficulty.</p>
                            <p>The SPEAKER. There is not the slightest difficulty in the law about
                                this action. The law does not say that no more clerks shall be
                                appointed. It does not take away from the House, the power to
                                appoint. There is no absolute prohibition, it is simply
                                directory.</p>
                            <p>Mr. HAVENS demanded the yeas and nays on the reconsideration, and the
                                vote was reconsidered, by yeas 65, nays 30, and the question
                                recurred on the adoption of Mr. Davis' resolution.</p>
                            <p>Mr. DAVIS now proposed to modify the resolution so as to make it
                                directory to the <orgName>Judiciary committee</orgName> to report a
                                bill authorizing the <orgName>committees on Ways and
                                Means</orgName>, and on the <orgName>Judiciary</orgName>, each to
                                employ a clerk. He desired this to test the sense of the House. He
                                desired to know whether the House would be in favor of the passage
                                of such a bill. He demanded the yeas and nays on the question.</p>
                            <p>Mr. HELLER moved to amend further adding authority for the employment
                                of other clerks.</p>
                            <p>Mr. CALDWELL. The statute does not say that there shall not be any
                                more clerks, and the House has the inherent power to authorize just
                                as many clerks as may be actually required. He concluded therefore
                                that it is now in the power of the House to give these two
                                committees each an additional clerk.</p>
                            <p>Mr. TRUSLER was as ready and willing as any member to render all the
                                assistance needed by the committees, but could not vote for a
                                proposition to violate the law.</p>
                            <p>The SPEAKER reminded the gentleman from Fayette, that it is not in
                                order to reflect upon the action of the House.</p>
                            <p>Mr. TRUSLER simply asked to be permitted to read from the statutes
                                that they shall employ clerks "not to exceed" the number prescribed
                                in particular.</p>
                            <p>Mr. HAVENS insisted upon the strict language of the statute just
                                quoted. The Legislature two years ago had the power to pass this
                                law, and we have the power to amend it; but he could not subscribe
                                to the doctrine that this House may in practice over-ride the law.
                                It would be a dangerous precedent - one that would come back to
                                plague us in the future. He did not believe that, under the statute,
                                this House has the power to employ clerks beyond the number
                                prescribed, and he was opposed to "whipping the devil around the
                                stump."</p>
                            <p>Mr. MARTIN, of Wells, was willing for the present to try and get
                                along without any additional clerical help, and whenever he found
                                that he could not discharge his duty, both in the House and on the
                                committee, he might vote for the proposed law.</p>
                            <p>Mr. FORKNER submitted a resolution, requesting the <orgName>committee
                                    on the Judiciary</orgName> and the <orgName>committee on Ways
                                    and Means</orgName> to report to the House as to the necessity
                                of each of said committees employing a clerk or secretary.</p>
                            <p>Mr. TAYLOR, of Tipton, could not vote for any violation of law, but,
                                if these committees report to the House that they have <pb n="68"
                                    xml:id="VAA8558-15-086"/> actual need of help, he would vote
                                them help.</p>
                            <p>On motion of Mr, WATERMAN, the resolution, amendments, and the whole
                                subject were laid on the table.</p>

                            <p>On motion of Mr. KENNEDY, of Montgomery, his bill [H. R 30] to
                                provide for the commencement of criminal procutions by information,
                                was taken up and considered on the third and last reading.</p>
                            <p>Mr. KENNEDY, of Montgomery. The object and purpose of the bill is to
                                obviate the necessity of having the grand jury called together so
                                often. If this bill become a law it will obviate the necessity,
                                except at remote periods to call the grand jury. At present the
                                grand jury has to be called often, not - unfrequently, three or four
                                times during the same term, because there is no statute or other
                                provision by which a criminal prosecution can be commenced than by
                                indictment of a grand jury. It will save thousands of dollars
                                annually to the treasury.</p>
                            <p>Mr. HAVENS. This bill was not reported upon with his approbation as a
                                member of the <orgName>Judiciary committee</orgName>. It involves
                                serious questions too serious to be acted on hastily. The grand jury
                                system has stood for hundreds of years, and the attack upon it and
                                approaches for its overthrow should be taken with careful steps.
                                Justice is now administered as readily in the State of Indiana as
                                anywhere. This bill will create a kind of espoinagean objectionable
                                inquisitorial power will be placed in the hands of the Prosecuting
                                Attorney. It makes of that officer, a kind of high court of
                                inquisition, to call upon men and compel them to leave their
                                business and testify. There may be some counties in which it would
                                not much-effect the public service, but in the larger cities as
                                Indianapolis and Terre Haute, it might work very badly in the hands
                                of a designing Prosecutor. It was taking too long a stride toward
                                the destruction of the grand jury system.</p>
                            <p>Mr. KENNEDY, of Marion, was in favor of wiping out all old fogyism,
                                such as our grand jury system. That system costs too much. It
                                requires too large a fraction of the taxation to support it. This
                                bill would be not only cheaper in its operation for the criminal
                                administration of the laws, but it would be better also for the
                                prisoner, by giving him his trial at once. In his judgment the Judge
                                would be as competent to the trial as the jury, and the Prosecutor
                                as competent and satisfactory for the presentment as the grand
                                jury.</p>
                            <p>Mr. WILLETT moved that the bill be laid on the table and printed.</p>
                            <p>Mr. KENNEDY, of Montgomery, opposed the motion to print, and all
                                motions for delay.</p>
                            <p>Mr. FORKNER hoped the bill would be passed without delay. It will be
                                just as efficient as the grand jury system, and much more
                                economical. There would be less expense, and the defendant would
                                have a better chance of knowing what is being done in his case than
                                he would by carrying it before the grand jury. He saw in the bill
                                neither hardship nor injury.</p>
                            <p>Mr. RATLIFF of Wayne spoke in favor of the motion to print desiring
                                more time to investigate the bill.</p>
                            <p>Mr. HELLER. One part of this bill would compel him to vote against
                                it. Whenever you give the prosecuting attorney this power, with the
                                fees attached, he might commence numerous prosecutions that would
                                not stick. He gave his knowledge of the practice of a deputy
                                prosecutor in his county, who took it upon himself large
                                responsibility in this direction.</p>
                            <p>Mr. DARNALL. Here is a proposition for reform, if it is a reform, in
                                the right direction - in the direction of economy as well as
                                directness and readiness in the matter of trial. Whilst it did not
                                abolish the grand jury system, it afforded a means of proscution
                                without it. The grand jury is an ex parte court, and hence the
                                reason that so small a percentage of their indictments stick. - As
                                it is at present, it is well known that the grand jury is governed
                                by the opinion of the prosecuting attorney, and therefore the same
                                objections that are urged against this reform might arise against
                                the grand jury system itself. As to corruption in regard to the
                                Prosecutor, the Judge would take care of that; and corruption can
                                hardly be supposed in the Judge and the Prosecutor at the same
                                time.</p>
                            <p>Mr. CLARK believed that the pending bill is less liable to the charge
                                of being inquisitorial than the Grand Jury system. He was especially
                                in favor of the principle of economy involved. He preferred it to
                                his own bill looking toward reform in that direction, because better
                                matured. He did not favor the entire abolition of the grand jury
                                system.</p>
                            <p>Mr. ROSEBERRY had seen something of the working of the Grand Jury
                                system, and came here in favor of its abolition. It may have once
                                worked well; but he regarded it as a bad thing for us. Any system
                                that puts in jeopardy the rights of the citizen, and deprives him of
                                the immediate right to confront his accusers with witnesses was
                                unfit for this age. To say nothing about their expensiveness, he was
                                entirely opposed to Grand Juries, and <pb n="69"
                                    xml:id="VAA8558-15-087"/> the Grand Jury System. Like our
                                toppling old Statehouse, it has served its day.</p>
                            <p>Mr. MARTIN of Wells thought, that: when we take a step for reform we
                                should not take such a one as would place an officer of the law in a
                                false position. He should not be left with a discretion to prosecute
                                or not. There should be such an amendment to the bill as this, That
                                if information be given to the prosecutor, on affidavit, he shall
                                proceed to prosecute, etc.</p>
                            <p>Mr. LANHAM considered that this is a question of so much importance
                                that nothing can be lost by taking time for examination. Though
                                himself a man of progress he found himself far in the rear of many
                                in this House in regard to the abolition of the Grand Jury
                                system.</p>
                            <p>Mr. DAVIS. The Grand Jury system is one of the safeguards of liberty,
                                and woe be to this country when it is stricken down. Without the
                                Grand Jury, how would you enforce the Baxter or any other of the
                                liquor or Sunday laws? He gave examples. But now the witnesses can
                                go to the prosecutor, and they are bound to go to the Grand Jury,
                                without the least occasion for the censure of their neighbors. Under
                                this bill, perhaps, prosecutions might be as frequent as under the
                                Grand Jury. However, he was willing to go the length proposed by the
                                bill of the gentleman from Montgomery; and that was the extent to
                                which he would be willing to go in that direction. He gave other
                                examples of warning to gentlemen of radical ideas against the Grand
                                Jury system.</p>
                            <p>Mr. KENNEDY of Montgomery. This bill does not propose to abolish the
                                Grand Jury system; its sole object being to dispense with the
                                frequent calling of the Grand Jury by the Judge, - perhaps it might
                                not be necessary in some counties to call the Grand Jury more than
                                once in four or five years. As to the objection on account of weak
                                and corrupt Prosecuting Attorneys, - the people elect these
                                prosesecutors, - and the same objection could be raised against the
                                law for the election of Judges by the people.</p>
                            <p>Mr. HAVENS. It was dangerous to trust too much power in the hands of
                                an individual, or in the hands of the few. It was plain that the
                                rights of the people were more safe in the hands of twelve men than
                                in the handset one If the Grand Jury has protected the people in the
                                past, he could see neither the wisdom nor the safety of this bill.
                                If he understood the bill, the prosecutor has the right to go at any
                                time before a justice and compel any man to appear and testify.</p>
                            <p>Mr WOODY looked upon the bill as a compromise between the extreme
                                views of those who oppose and those who desire the retention of the
                                Grand Jury system. This then is a step in the right direction - to
                                learn how to do this little criminal business cheaper, and perhaps
                                just as well; and he gave the reasons why he should support the
                                bill.</p>
                            <p>Mr. MORGAN asked whether it would not be virtually to abolish the
                                Grand Juries by leaving it to the judge when they shall be called
                                together. Might it not be safe to provide specifically now often, or
                                in what contingency, the judge shall call the Grand Jury.</p>
                            <p>Mr. KENNEDY, of Montgomery. The law now requires the judge to call
                                the Grand Jury once in five years; and this bill does not interfere
                                with that.</p>
                            <p>Mr. MORGAN. There should be some provision which should compel
                                prosecutions.</p>
                            <p>Mr WILLIAMS, of Brown, cautiously advised against hasty action, -
                                would retain the Grand Jury for Felony cases, and place the rest of
                                its business where the processes might be cheaper and more
                                expeditious.</p>
                            <p>Mr JOHNSON, of Carroll, was in favor of the bill because it would
                                save expense, and because it would prevent the jail incarcerat on of
                                innocent individuals under the groundless indictment of a Grand
                                Jury. The day has come when the Grand Jury should be either
                                partially or entirely abolished.</p>
                            <p>Mr. DARNALL was opposed to the Grand Jury system. He was pledged to
                                do away with the Grand Jury intervention in all cases of
                                misdemeanor. He was willing therefore to take this bill as a
                                compromise.</p>
                            <p>The motion to lay on the table and print was then adopted.</p>

                                            forbidden in this Hall during the session and recess
                                            time of this Legislature; and that the Doorkeeper see

                            <p>The SPEAKER. The Chair will say to the gentleman that <sic>that</sic>
                                is now - in the Rules: the only change is, that this forbids smoking
                                in the recess.</p>
                            <p>Mr. CLARK. We hear a good deal said here about the bad air and
                                ventilation of this Hall; and for those who never use tobacco - he
                                was of that number - the scent of tobacco throughout the Hall had a
                                deleterious effect, and it remains in the air some time after it is
                                given out. Therefore, since we are compelled to be here, I will take
                                it as very kind if the House will vote that smoking shall not be
                                indulged in this Hall during the session.</p>
                            <p>The resolution was adopted.</p>

                                            State, as relates to the taxation of Life Insurance
                                            premiums collected by Life Insurance companies not
                                            organized in this State. This tax is not paid by some
                                            "foreign corporations," as many may suppose but by us as
                                            individual members of these corporations. The companies
                                            have decided to deduct from all dividends payable on and
                                            after January 1st, 1875, a percentage on the premiums
                                            equivalent to the percentage assessed by the State in

                                            perceive from whose pockets all this expense must be

                            <p>Mr. HOUGH from the <orgName>committee on corporations</orgName>
                                returned Mr. Slater's bill, [S 28, described on page 23 of these
                                Reports,] with a recommendation that it do pass.</p>
                            <p>He said: The only change this bill proposes to make from the present
                                law, is that it exempts from town or city tax all over five acres of
                                ground lying within the corporate limits.</p>
                            <p>Mr. GOODING. It strikes me that we ought not to pass a law relieving
                                from city taxes the property of a man wealthy enough to own a farm
                                within the corporate limits; therefore, I am opposed to concurring
                                in the report of the committee.</p>
                            <p>Mr. BEARSS. Cities and towns in our part of the country take the
                                liberty of extending their corporations over all the farms joining,
                                and I am opposed to taxing farm lands for city purposes. And I am
                                opposed to these annexation ordinances, for I am of opinion that a
                                farmer has the right to live upon a farm without being obliged to
                                pay city taxes. I move to amend so that cities under ten thousand
                                shall not be assessed over fifty cents on the one hundred dollars
                                valuation, [instead of one dollar as fixed by the bill.]</p>
                            <p>Mr. BELL. I concur in the remarks marks made by the gentleman from
                                Vanderburg [Mr. Gooding.] We have seen the evils of such a law as
                                this in the city - [Ft. Wayne] where I reside. There are persons
                                there owning large bodies of land in the city, that they surround
                                with a high fence, who reap all the advantages of a city government,
                                who resist the opening of streets and alleys, and retard the
                                progress of the city all that is possible, and yet do enough farming
                                on them to allow them to be called farming lands in order to escape
                                city taxation. I shall oppose the bill and hope it will not
                                pass.</p>
                            <p>Mr. GIVAN. This bill might work great hardships if it should become a
                                law. I do not see why any distinction should be made between real
                                estate and personal property. The true principle of taxation is that
                                it should work equally upon every person, and upon all kinds and
                                species of property. I can see no reason for the passage of this
                                bill.</p>
                            <p>Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN. The law exempting from municipal taxation five
                                acres of land within the corporation limits was repealed last
                                session. It gave satisfaction in the town where I live, and I see no
                                reason why such an act should be reestablished.</p>
                            <p>Mr. SLATER. I introduced this bill in justice to the people who live
                                in the city where I reside. The city authorities have seen proper to
                                extend the corporation limits over farms for miles around without
                                the volition of the farmers residing thereon, since which they find
                                it impossible to make enough off their farms to pay their taxes. I
                                have no doubt but other cities are in the same condition as the city
                                of Franklin, and I think it is not just to force these people inside
                                the corporation limits against their protest and then to tax them so
                                largely that they cannot make the tax off the land.</p>
                            <p>Mr. LARUE. I am in favor of the general provisions of the bill, but
                                there is one thing that ought to be guarded. The bill ought to be
                                recommitted with instructions to amend so that lands lying within
                                the corporation limits, in larger bodies than five acres, shall not
                                be taxed at a higher rate for city purposes than are other lands in
                                the township where the cities are situated.</p>
                            <p>Mr. BEARSS. The city of Ft. Wayne has contracted debts so large that
                                perhaps she won't be able to pay them during the life time of any
                                gentleman on this floor, and as fast as she becomes involved in a
                                new debt, she reaches out and takes in another farm, and it is
                                simply robbery, gentleman of the Senate, [laughter] nothing more nor
                                nothing less. The only question is whether a farmer who settled in
                                this country at an early day, is to be permitted, quietly to live on
                                his own farm, without being forced to connect himself with a city so
                                corrupt, that a decent man can hardly live in it. [Laughter.]</p>
                            <p>Mr. BELL. I shall enter into no defence of the city of Fort Wayne
                                here. She needs none. I do not know how many farms are owned in the
                                heart of cities in <pb n="80" xml:id="VAA8558-15-098"/>the Senator's
                                district; there are but few in our city - only one or two. We are
                                able to take care of our debt in Ft. Wayne. We are advancing as fast
                                as any city in the State, unless we except Indianapolis; of course,
                                we can't expect to keep up with the city of concentric circles.</p>
                            <p>Mr. HOUGH. I think the amendment proposed by the Senator from Miami,
                                (Mr. Bearss,) is not germane to the bill. As to the other amendment,
                                it seems to me the bill itself embraces what is sought to be
                                effected by the amendment. As far as I know, none of the members of
                                the <orgName>committee on Corporations</orgName> present when this
                                bill was considered, live in cities, and, of course, they had no
                                personal interest in the matter. I think the principle involved in
                                this bill is fair, and if carried out in good faith, would conduce
                                to the benefit of all parties concerned. I want to do simply what is
                                right - nothing more and nothing less. I have no serious objection
                                to the re-commitment of the bill.</p>
                            <p>[A message from the House of Representatives here announced the
                                passage by that body of a joint resolution [H. R. 5] for memorial

                                now, I do not see why the owner should not be willing to bear some
                                of the burdens of the source which made it so valuable. When I came
                                to this city lands could be <sic>be</sic> bought for three or four
                                dollars an acre that now thousands of dollars would not buy. It is
                                wrong for a city to make streets and walks around farms and not
                                compel the owners to pay corporation tax upon them.</p>
                            <p>Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN. I move to indefinitely postpone the bill, report
                                and pending amendments.</p>
                            <p>Mr. SLEETH. I cannot concur in the report of the committee. It seems
                                to me there is liable to be hardship in either extreme of this
                                question. It is not right for a city council or the county
                                commissioners to include farms within the limits of a city, and tax
                                them for city purposes. And when a man's land is advancing every
                                year from two to three hundred per cent., while all the appliances
                                of a city are surrounding him, it is not right that he should
                                receive such benefits from a city without bearing some of its
                                burdens. We dare not legislate upon sentimental affections for the
                                old homestead. The owners ought to contribute their equal portion of
                                taxes with other persons.</p>
                            <p>Mr. GOODING. It seems to me we are going to a great deal of
                                unnecessary labor. What is generally complained of is the
                                extraordinary power conferred on county commissioners to annex
                                contiguous territory, and if gentlemen want to get rid of that evil,
                                I would suggest that they prepare an amendment to the law putting a
                                restriction upon them to prevent their abusing that power.</p>
                            <p>Mr. JOHNSTON of Parke. While I cannot vote for indefinite
                                postponement, I cannot vote for the bill in its present shape; I
                                have no experience in city life but my experience is that men who
                                own large bodies of land inside of corporations are the most
                                unpleasant men in the world to get along with, for they stand in the
                                way of all improvements. As an attorney I tried for three years to
                                open streets through some land in our town, and as bad as I hated to
                                I had to come to the legislature to get an act passed enabling me to
                                do so; because the owners refused to open streets, or to sell the
                                land for a reasonable amount. Real estate should be taxed at its
                                fair cash value, and when it becomes too valuable to farm, let the
                                owners dispose of it.</p>
                            <p>The yeas and nays were ordered on the motion to indefinitely
                                postpone, and being taken, resulted, yeas 19, nays 23, as

                        duties were so greatly increased that he has been unable to get these
                        Reports authorized for each session till too late to have a bill passed to
                        pay him for former services; and shrank from pushing his claim earlier in
                        each session for fear it would hazard the continuation of the work; and so
                        he has continued for some fifteen years to invest his money in this work

                        a State is in her history.</p>
                    <p>The BREVIER REPORTS is by far the cheapest job of work of the kind ever done
                        for ANY State; - this statement should go unquestioned inasmuch as one else
                        in the past has even offered to do it.</p>

                            <p>That seventeen years ago they organized and executed a plan of
                                independent unpartizan legislative reporting (the first ever
                                attempted here having regard to fullness and completeness as to the
                                matter and the parliamentary forms,) upon which they have printed
                                their Reports at a cost to the State less by one half than any
                                similar job of the State's printing; That their work proved
                                acceptable to the General Assembly and received acts for
                                authorization and pay: That it has been maintained and has received
                                similar acts of endorsement every session since - and we
                                respectfully submit that under this usage of the General Assembly we
                                have a fair constructive permission and invitation to continue our
                                independent work of elaborating and offering the BREVIER
                                REPORTS.</p>
                            <p>The fifteenth Volume of the BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS of the
                                Proceedings and Debates of the Indiana Legislature, will embrace
                                reliable short hand sketches of the Journals, Proceedings and
                                Debates of both Houses of the Forty-ninth General Assembly of the
                                State of Indiana, convened at Indianapolis, in regular session the
                                7th day of January, 1875. It will contain all Motions, Messages,
                                Resolutions and Committee Reports as they shall be made and
                                submitted; it will describe or copy at length all Bills and
                                Propositions as they shall be presented and considered; and it will
                                afford liberal and verbatim sketches of the Debates, presenting
                                without partisan bias the position of every member on the floor,
                                with the yeas and nays in every question of moment on which they
                                shall be ordered and taken.</p>
                            <p>The BREVIER REPORTS will be, as it has been for years past, the only
                                source from which reliable reports of the Debates of the Legislature
                                can be obtained. This has been found to be the best and most
                                economical means of presenting to the people an intelligible
                                journal, not only of what is done, but of what is said, in the
                                General Assembly, together with a reliable account in proper
                                legislative forms, of the order of the doings and sayings of the
                                representatives of the people.</p>
                            <p>The undesigned submit, that these Reports are indispensable to the
                                history of Legislation in the State, of great value for information
                                to the people at large, especially to politicians, the press and
                                every public man; and that their value is increased by time.</p>
                            <p>We propose to pursue the publication of our BREVIER LEGISLATIVE
                                REPORTS. But there is now this difficulty about our work; we are
                                unable to contract with either of the companies publishing morning
                                papers in this city for the daily printing of our Reports in their
                                newspaper or in any other daily form. Therefore, since our Reports
                                cannot appear in the papers as heretofore, and to provide against
                                the restrictions of space in the newspapers by which the Reports are
                                liable to be marred and excluded, we propose to contract for
                                printing outside of the daily press, so as to insure a complete and
                                satisfactory record. These contracts involve an inevitable expense
                                of money on our part, which is barely justified by the State's
                                authorization of the purchase of the number of copies of the Reports
                                which have been accorded in the Specific Bill of every session since
                                1857. The price is less than one-third which is paid tor the work of
                                the Reporter of the Supreme Court.</p>
                            <p>The past, we think, teaches plainly enough, that unless the General
                                Assembly were to establish a special Bureau for Reporting and
                                Printing, involving new offices and additional Public expensiveness,
                                which should be avoided by all means consistent with reasonable
                                carefulness for he information and welfare of the supervising
                                peoples our standing proposition is the best and certainly it is by
                                very much the cheapest way to escape the evils of partial reporting
                                in the interest of rings and factions. We think also, that the
                                general acceptance of our Reports for the past seventeen years
                                justifies the expectation that the Legislature will not now forego
                                the advantages of these contributions to the history of its work</p>

                            <p>THE BREVIER reporters in all the years of its publication have been
                                careful chiefly to make their work here a good record, and rest its
                                claims to the cherishment of the Legislature upon that alone. They
                                have gone before no Committee, lobbied none, received no approaches
                                for individual favor, nor shaped their work at any time with
                                sinister or partizan objects. It has rested solely and all the time
                                on its merits, its integrity and fairness; and for these it has all
                                the time received the favoring notice of the Legislature.</p>
                            <p>It is a fact also that the BREVIER REPORTS have done for the people
                                what the newspapers are unfit and unable to do in the matter of a
                                just and stern legislative record; and the work has been done
                                cheaper than the newspaper charges which have been paid out of the
                                treasury for their partial, personal, restricted and unreliable
                                matter called Legislative Proceedings.</p>
                            <p>The work cannot be done by jobbers for the money that has been paid
                                for it; and as to the standing contract price of the work, it
                                carries that on its every page: for "two-thirds of a cent a page per
                                copy" it is furnished to the proper accounting officers of the State
                                in printed sheets, <hi rend="i">procured in every item of its cost
                                    at our own expense</hi></p>
                            <p>Considering the difficulties and oppositions incident to such a work;
                                the contingencies of failing health and failing purse, and failing
                                at length to make an acceptable offering of the work, there is
                                nothing in the offering of it on our part but hard work, and the
                                good name of unswerving workers, much very delicate personal
                                responsibility, and some pecuniary hazard ( - large for our means -
                                ) and, at last and at the best, but meagre pay. We have proceeded
                                strictly upon the presumption that the people's representatives know
                                what is due to the country and to themselves in this matter of a
                                record of their legislative action. And, if there is any
                                consideration against the continuance of the BREVIER, except that of
                                its cost, the same conceit is as much against the lobbies and open
                                doors for the sessions of the General Assembly: and it is at least a
                                hundred years too late for secret sessions.</p>
                            <p>In this submission of the BREVIER REPORTS we have not been mistaken
                                as to the common and growing public demand for just and intelligent
                                public records. We have tried to meet that demand, and to provoke
                                parties abler than we are to supply it as it ought to be supplied.
                                And we still suppose that the Representatives of the people know
                                what they want in this matter - know whether it is better to do
                                everything here at the Capitol by memory and word of mouth, than to
                                stand upon a fair and open record for history.</p>
                            <p>As thirteen consecutive sessions of General Assembly have authorized
                                the publication of the Brevier Reports it is regarded respectful and
                                a duty to continue a proffer of the service that has been acceptable
                                to every Legislature for so many years.</p>
                            <p>The Brevier Reports contain a record that is impartial - not a single
                                partial report can be found in any of the fifteen volumes
                                issued.</p>
                            <p>Three-fourths of a cent per page has been paid by the State
                                heretofore for compiling the decisions of the Supreme Court which
                                can be done as well as it ever has been by hundreds of citizens of
                                Indiana, while none in the State are so compeled to make a
                                Legislative Record as the protectors of the BREVIER REPORTS because
                                the entire lives of no other Indianians have been passed in such
                                like service As compensation should always be regulated by the skill
                                required, there can be no question but that the pay for service but
                                few are competent to perform should largely exceed the pay for labor
                                that many are able to do. Nearly one half of the last volume of the
                                BREVIER REPORTS, in each page, contains more than three times as
                                much matter there is in one page of the Supreme Court Reports, yet
                                the BREVIER REPORTS are furnished to the State for two thirds a cent
                                per page, while the Reporter of the Supreme Court has received three
                                quarters of a cent per page, besides the copy right.</p>
                            <p>The particulars of Legislative expenses for the Extra Session of
                                1872, itemized to the Specific Bill, approved Dec. 21, 1872,
                                justifies our statement "that the Legislature found the cost of the
                                newspaper subsidies for legislative reports in this city to exceed
                                that of the authentic BREVIER.</p>
                            <p>The cost of new papers for that session above that of the BREVIER was
                                $356 73.</p>
                            <p>The newspaper vanished, but the BREVIER is extant, with all its
                                contributions to history.</p>
                            <p>Other comparisons might be gathered from the specific appropriation
                                bills for the last seventeen years, which might cast even a more
                                favoring light on the fact: that in all fair, honest work the best
                                is always and every way the cheapest; and from the same sources
                                whence these conclusion's are drawn there might also be more light
                                thrown on the fact that reporting is a profession, and fair
                                reporting is a distinction not always attainable for the highest
                                public service by a metropolitan newspaper.</p>
