                    especially as scholars became more interested in social history. Hardly an American history textbook
                    is published today that does not draw on the Lynds' studies for illustrations and
                    generalizations regarding "typical" family and community life in the 1920s and
                    1930s.</p>

                    </placeName> may not have been the wisest choice of a typical American community. Some of <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s citizens agreed, or at least preferred that the Lynds had settled elsewhere.
                    These social scientists, they suggested, did not fully understand the real <placeName>

                    </hi>
               <hi rend="sup">1</hi> was a stunning success. True, America was accustomed to success in 1929,
                    but when the printers were called on six times to rush more copies, the publishers knew this was not
                    a typical sociological treatise. To H. L. Mencken reviewing the book in <hi rend="i">American
                        Mercury</hi> this "city in Moronia" was scientific proof of the silliness and
                    self-delusion of the booboisie.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Sinclair Lewis had already exposed the
                    shallowness of babbittry and main street in general; Thorstein Veblen had for decades condemned the
                    pecuniary business culture. Now Robert and Helen Lynd showed in incredible detail how that culture
                    actually worked in the life of typical people in a typical city. Muckracking exposes of big bosses
                    and robber barons had gone out of style by 1929, but here was an expose of the inner flaws of
                    American society itself.</p>

                    </hi> can be approached on several levels. It was, and remains, an astonishingly informative
                    description of everyday life in a small city. Like <hi rend="i">Main Street</hi> it attained
                    versimilitude by precise description of routine behavior and by close rendering of actual
                    conversations. <hi rend="i">

                    </hi>, however, was vastly more comprehensive in scope. The Lynds followed the lead of cultural
                    anthropologists who tried to encompass the whole of a primitive society under the six rubrics of
                    getting a living, making a home, training the young, using leisure, engaging in religious practices,
                    and engaging in community activities.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

            <p>Besides their conceptual outline, the Lynds borrowed the technique of participant observation. Five
                    staff investigators spent fifty months in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>, attending meetings of all sorts, talking with expert informants and
                    "typical" men and women. Their job was to discover what people did, why they
                    thought they did it, and how all the activity reflected the mainsprings of American culture. The
                    anthropological tone of the final report treated middle America as an ethnologist would treat an
                    aboriginal tribe. Thus the Lynds contrasted the superficiality of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s art clubs with parallel behavior among the Todas.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> This
                    style produced not only a detached scientific tone to the book but also allowed cosmopolitan readers
                    to remove themselves from the parochialism of the objects of study. <hi rend="i">

                        </placeName>
                    </hi> thereby distinguished itself from the hundreds of social surveys of American communities that
                    had already been published. Those surveys reflected the spirit of uplift of the Progressive era and
                    were directed primarily at opinion leaders in the community itself.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> The Lynds,
                    in sharp contrast, carefully announced that <placeName>

                    </placeName> had not been consulted about the project beforehand and had contributed nothing to its

                    perspective—one too broad for the taste of most sociologists and too far ahead of its
                    time to be properly appreciated. Their overarching concern was how the process of industrialization
                    had transformed the values and personalities of Americans. Modernization—as scholars call
                    it now—is a central concern of current social science and history. The Lynds were the
                    first American scholars to explore the impact of modernization on all aspects of everyday life.

                    </placeName> folk who could not comprehend or cope with the changes about them missed the
                    significance of modernization. Apparently the Lynds, their own interests shifting, eventually lost
                    interest in the theme too.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lynds' model of modernization involved the shift from a sleepy, rural, preindustrial
                    organic society to a pecuniary culture dominated by the interests of business. The engine of change
                    was high speed machine technology. In classical Marxist fashion, the Lynds assumed that personality
                    and culture were determined by material or economic causes. The intensive study of a typical
                    American city transformed by new industry would, therefore, present a case study of the impact of
                        modernization.<hi rend="sup">10</hi>

            <p>The modernization model determined the choice of cities to study. They wanted a place that had

                    the business class was responsible for all the innovations, and thus all the problems. The working
                    class, although 70 percent of the population, lacked class consciousness, for the system had broken
                    the labor unions.<hi rend="sup">19</hi> The hegemony of the business class was total, as the

                    reduced saving, and family clothing and food budgets were sacrificed. They found twenty-one car
                    owners who lacked bathtubs. Candy sales were down because of the cost of autos, and, quoting a labor
                    leader, "the Ford car has done an awful lot of harm to the unions," because the
                    men would rather drive around than attend meetings.<hi rend="sup">29</hi> The Lynds dramatized their

                    an average 9 percent of their annual incomes for automobile purchase, gasoline, and upkeep, not

                    itself. Youth fought parents for control of the car, then used it for petting and sex crimes. The
                    authors skipped over their evidence that motoring trips were bringing families closer together, but
                    they did acknowledge that the rapid growth of scheduled vacations centered on auto trips. The Lynds
                    did not appreciate the impact of the auto in extending the range of employment and shopping for both
                    urban and rural families, but they did show great concern about the supposed decline of residential
                    neighborhoods. On the whole, they found the automobile an artificial mechanical enticement that

            <p>The Lynds were mystified as to why some people belonged to the business class and others to the
                    working class. At one point they suggested that "the mere fact of being born upon one or
                    the other side of the watershed … is the most significant single cultural factor tending
                    to influence what one does all day long throughout one's life."<hi rend="sup">35</hi> Elsewhere, however, they concluded that luck and happenstance were decisive: children
                    "for the most part … ‘go to work’ by taking advantage of
                    some vacancy they or their families happen to hear about and <hi rend="i">spend the rest of their

            <p>The Lynds believed that the traditional "rags to riches" pattern of upward social
                    mobility within a single lifetime was being destroyed by industrialization. They calculated that
                    only one factory worker in fifty-three was promoted to foreman in a twenty-one month period.<hi rend="sup">39</hi> Allowing that industrialization was increasing the number of opportunities to
                    own garages, filling stations, electrical shops, and other small businesses, they warned that the
                    opportunity to become a manufacturer was declining. The Lynds were shifting their concept of strata
                    from the business-working dichotomy to a sort of independent versus hired classification and
                    lamenting that industrialization increased the latter category more than the former. The point was
                    underscored in the conclusion in the second volume: <quote rend="blockquote">

                    The Lynds' lovingly detailed description of the craft of glass blowing in the 1890s
                    contrasted starkly with their exposure of the high speed, highly mechanized system of 1924. The new
                    industrial system forced men to work harder and faster, "activity seemingly so foreign to
                    many of the most powerful impulses of human beings."<hi rend="sup">41</hi> They quoted an
                    executive about one machinist's work: "But it's so endlessly monotonous!

            <p>The Lynds phrased their findings—wild guesses, really—in terms of the fate of
                    the typical worker. Their own evidence showed that the younger factory workers in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> were recruited chiefly from nearby farms, <hi rend="i">not</hi> from craftsmen stripped
                    of their skills. In the early twentieth century, nationwide, the number of male craftsmen increased
                    every year (at a compound rate of 2.9 percent per year from 1900 to 1920), while the number of
                    unskilled laborers grew half as fast (1.5 percent per year), and the number of factory workers
                    increased at a slightly faster rate (3.4 percent per year). The number of farmers held constant, as
                    surplus farm youth by the hundreds of thousands flocked to nearby towns and small cities like <placeName>

                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">44</hi> Shifts were even more dramatic in the case of the native white
                    men, because most of the unskilled and semiskilled jobs at the bottom were taken by new immigrants,
                    thereby forcing the old stock workers upward. The Lynds missed this dramatic shift because they
                    studied one of the very few old stock factory towns without European immigrants.<hi rend="sup">45</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Quite apart from national trends pointing the other way, the Lynds could have supported their
                    argument with living examples of men damaged by industrialization. Their research design, however,
                    destroyed this possibility. They did not interview workers about the jobs they held in 1924 or in
                    the past. Of the thousands of skilled young craftsmen who worked in <placeName>

                    the employment characteristics, such as job titles, job changes, and unemployment that they studied
                    were based on indirect sources. The critical factors of job satisfaction, the work ethic,
                    displacement of skills, and lifetime upward mobility were "explained" through
                    speculation, even though hard evidence could have been obtained just by asking the men directly.</p>

                    reign to speculation. The Lynds argued that the degradation of craft skills and the blockage of
                    vertical mobility on the part of the working class gave the lie to America's
                    "exuberant boast of a classless society." The mythical ladder of success, they
                    pointed out, was "the popular justification of the reigning <hi rend="i">laissez-faire</hi>
                    philosophy—as regards the present predatory practices of business enterprise,"
                    the uneven distribution of wealth, and opposition to social reform. As reality and symbol drifted
                    apart, class consciousness should rise. This, the Lynds sadly noted, had not yet happened in <placeName>

                    within individual careers. That is, the amount of vertical mobility has been quite constant in

                    life, fully one-fifth of the book focused on this issue. The Lynds interviewed leading ministers and
                    laymen at length and attended hundreds of religious services, YMCA programs, and meetings of social
                    groups sponsored by <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s churches. They took copious notes on sermons and examined every relevant
                    document and unpublished record they could find.</p>
            <p>The results were thin. The four chapters on religion in <hi rend="i">

                            <settlement type="city">Middletown</settlement>

                    </hi> were filled with poorly digested descriptions and long, rambling quotations. Perhaps the Lynds
                    lost interest in religion after finishing the fieldwork; perhaps the sponsors would not allow a
                    merciless expose. The Lynds found that among adults, their parents in 1890, and their children in
                    1924, striking differences existed across class lines. The business class attended services and
                    meetings more faithfully, but religion played a far less central role in their lives than it did
                    among the working class, regardless of generation. Secularization thus came in two forms: each
                    succeeding generation was less religious than the previous one, and the business class was more
                    secular than the working class. The Lynds made little of this important finding, preferring instead
                    to concentrate on how irrelevant religious credos actually had become in this era of
                    industrialization.</p>
            <p>The modernization of society in the previous generation apparently had little impact on religion. The
                    Lynds clearly sympathized with the problems faced by the leading Protestant ministers in searching
                    for new roles to play (Robert Lynd held a divinity degree from <placeName>

                    Presbyterian minister somewhere). Although the ministers were eager to adopt new techniques for
                    publicity, counselling, and fund raising, they were reluctant to abandon entirely the spiritual
                    heritage they represented, even if the congregation paid no attention. "My people seem to

            <p>The Lynds' observation that religion had changed little in a generation could have supported
                    an entirely opposite conclusion from the one reached. Religion might have been the first institution
                    to modernize, and in turn have generated the spirit of capitalism that produced economic changes. In
                    1905, Max Weber, in the <hi rend="i">Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism</hi>, argued as
                    much. The English translation appeared in 1930, but the Lynds must have had some notion of the

                    which behavior, attitudes, and values flowed. They had to conclude that religion was either a

                    shallow and had forced the city to rely heavily upon outside aid. The New Deal did far more than
                    pump money into the stricken city. It brought municipal improvements that had long been needed but
                    which "prosperous" <placeName>

                    important, the New Deal brought planning to a culture that prided itself on individual initiative
                    and distrust of government. The Lynds showed that <placeName>

                    genre in American studies. They moved sociology away from the reform-oriented community survey
                    toward a scientific study of culture. While it is impossible to agree with the Lynds'
                    contention that "consideration of <placeName>

                    ‘better’ or ‘worse’ is, obviously, irrelevant to the

                    their work in forming America's self-image. The historian is astonished that this style of
                    sociology has virtually died out. The Lynds contemplated a third report on <placeName>

                    "pluralism" paradigm. A community was not governed by a single elite, according to
                    Dahl, but rather by competing interest or pressure groups motivated into political activity in
                    response to issues directly affecting them.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> Ritchie P. Lowry added a unique
                    twist to the pluralism thesis; one that was especially useful in the present study. Based on
                    research in Chico, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>, Lowry asserted that pluralism can result in an abdication of leadership responsibility
                    with the consequence that no one really runs a community.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Recently another significant model of local decision making has emerged as a counterweight to both
                    the Lynds' elitism and Dahl's pluralism. Daniel J. Elazar, in a concept designated
                    as "federalism," postulated that major decisions concerning a community usually
                    were not determined by either a local elite or by polylithic, hometown pressure groups. Elazar
                    questioned the ability of an elite to dominate because of the diffusion of power created by
                    numerous, overlapping governmental units (municipal, township, county, etc.) within the same
                    locality. Yet civic pressure groups normally did not take the initiative to resolve problems either.
                    Rather, solutions to local issues generally were encouraged, enforced, or stimulated by agencies or
                    authorities "outside" the community, such as the state and federal governments.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

                    too often the result was a deadlock in the decision-making process. When competing factions of
                    municipal officials or interest and pressure groups were unable to arrive at answers to issues
                    facing the community, the intervention of external political or governmental forces prompted
                    solutions. Three major issues important to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> during the 1930s—the debate over the municipal airport, the disagreement
                    about funding Civil Works Administration projects, and the decade-long controversy concerning river
                    pollution and sewage treatment—will be used to test this revised hypothesis of political
                        influence.<hi rend="sup">10</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One preliminary point must be made: much of the outside intervention in municipal affairs during the
                    1930s was the result of the Great Depression and Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. Federal
                    intrusion in local affairs did exist prior to the 1930s. On November 12, 1927, for example, thirty
                    federal agents "invaded" <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>

                    the Prohibition Amendment. Such action was necessary because municipal police officers had failed to
                    carry out their duties. As historian Paul A. Carter has noted, "the Noble Experiment was
                    among other things an enormous augmentation of the power of the Federal Government."<hi rend="sup">11</hi> Other than law enforcement, however, federal interposition was limited prior

            <p>In March, 1930, Johnson's aviation department requested $125,000 from the new
                    city council, nine of the members of which were Democrats, in order to complete construction of the
                    airport. At a public hearing, on March 17, attorney Tod Whipple presented a petition, which he
                    claimed contained three thousand signatures, urging the municipal lawmakers to deny approval of the
                    appropriation because of the depressed state of the local economy. Despite Whipple's
                    protestations, the city council by a margin of ten to three passed an ordinance providing for a bond
                    issue in the amount requested by the aviation department.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mayor Dale's views on the airport were not known publicly until March 29, when he
                    unexpectedly vetoed the bond ordinance. Contending that he represented the opinion of 90 percent of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s citizens, Dale explained that the city was incapable of shouldering such a
                    heavy financial burden at a time when there were more pressing civic demands.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>
                    At its April 7 session the council majority mustered only eight votes, thus failing to override the
                    mayor's veto by the required two-thirds margin. Two Democratic councilmen from the south
                    side, working-class section of the city, Clarence R. Hole and Ora T. Shroyer, changed their votes to
                    help sustain the veto.<hi rend="sup">29</hi> Hole defended his reversal on the grounds that he had
                    been besieged with telephone calls, personal visits, and a petition, bearing the names of over two
                    hundred of his constituents, to vote against the measure. Shroyer admitted that he still favored the
                    airport but switched his vote due to pressure from the taxpayers of his ward.<hi rend="sup">30</hi>

                    editor-mayor held office. The causes of the conflict between Dale and the city council were numerous

                    quixotic and uncompromising nature were among the reasons for the differences. From 1930 through
                    1932, ten members of the municipal legislature voted against Mayor Dale consistently—and
                    six of the anti-administration faction were Democrats. During the period 1933–1934, Dale
                    actually gained the support of seven councilmen on most major issues. Yet, the council majority did
                    not back the mayor with any enthusiasm during those last two years.<hi rend="sup">31</hi> The
                    pinnacle of the bitter divisiveness was reached in September, 1932, when the council impeached Dale.
                    The office of mayor was declared vacant on the grounds that Dale was not eligible to retain the post
                    due to his conviction in federal district court for alleged violation of the Prohibition

                    municipal government to build the airport. The facility was ultimately constructed, but with private
                    funds rather than taxpayers' money. Johnson, the younger members of the Ball family, and
                    the Chamber of Commerce failed to exert enough pressure to get city officials to do their bidding.

                    the resolution of the airport issue is that it certainly does not appear to be a prime example of

                    opposition to CWA efforts, but he did suggest that the <hi rend="i">Press</hi> editor was
                    disenchanted with the New Deal in general.<hi rend="sup">48</hi> Curiously Sutton made no reference

            <p>CWA provided federal funds to pay for labor, while the city contributed money for equipment and
                    materials. In order for the municipality to finance its share of the agreement, Mayor Dale requested
                    that the city council pass a $100,000 bond issue. As eager in this case to take advantage
                    of the federal largesse as Dale, the usually antagonistic council temporarily put aside its quarrel
                    with the mayor and unanimously approved the bond issue on December 11, 1933.<hi rend="sup">49</hi>
                    Adoption of the bond issue by the city was one matter; getting someone to purchase the bonds were
                    quite another story. When the city offered the bonds for sale on December 29, there were no bidders.
                    City Controller Lester E. Holloway, Mayor Dale's son-in-law, contended that he had made
                    every effort to persuade local financial institutions to purchase the bonds.<hi rend="sup">50</hi>

                    </placeName>'s banking houses had failed to express confidence in the municipality and its

                    Indiana which had not exceeded the constitutional limitation on its bonded indebtedness. Reportedly,
                    local banking officials refused to purchase the bonds because of the low interest rate of 4 1/2
                    percent. They also expressed anxiety concerning the ability of the municipality to liquidate its
                    financial obligations because of a 1932 state law that placed a $1.50 ceiling on the
                    combined tax rate of all local governmental units.<hi rend="sup">53</hi> According to one
                    hypothesis, Dale had antagonized bankers in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> by paying off the city's bonded indebtedness prematurely, thus depriving local
                    credit houses of anticipated interest. The bankers therefore had retaliated by refusing to buy his
                    CWA bonds.<hi rend="sup">54</hi> When asked about this nearly forty years later, Controller Holloway
                    did not substantiate this hypothesis, but he did intimate that local bankers were never friendly to
                    his father-in-law "and were not about to do anything that would help the Dale

                    have to return to the welfare rolls. Local businessmen had supplied tools and materials to the city
                    on credit after a gentlemen's agreement among the councilmen to pass the bond issue, so the

                    found the condition of the river deplorable when he first visited the city in 1924, nothing had been
                    done to improve the situation by the time he returned in 1935. Living along the north bank of the
                    river in a row of stately mansions, the Ball family had long agitated for sewage reduction in the
                    watercourse. Property owners in the working-class south side section of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>, however, were reluctant to help finance a sewage system that would benefit primarily
                    the Balls and other wealthy businessmen who inhabited the upper-class north side residential area.
                    Thus city councilmen from the south side failed to support proposals that would improve the color,
                    odor, and purity of <geogName>White River</geogName>. The Lynds, despite acknowledgement that south
                    siders had been able to obstruct a municipal sewage treatment program, saw no reason to alter their

            <p>When Dale became mayor in 1930, he immediately vowed that the sewer project would never be started
                    while he was in office. As editor he had opposed construction of the sewage system because he feared
                    that the one million dollar endeavor would be an irresistable opportunity for graft for the already
                    corrupt Hampton administration. As mayor he opposed the sewage system because the city could not
                    afford it. Dale contended that most of the pollution in the river was the result of untreated
                    industrial discharge. Therefore, he argued, if <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s industries would stop polluting, a sewage reduction plant would be
                        unnecessary.<hi rend="sup">71</hi>

            <p>Dale had been in office for less than a month when Dr. William F. King, secretary of the Indiana
                    State Board of Health, began to pressure him to take immediate steps to prevent continued defilement
                    of <geogName>White River</geogName>. The mayor refused, beginning a two-year confrontation between
                    Dale and King, which often assumed the stature of a farce.<hi rend="sup">72</hi> King received

                    five-year study of <geogName>White River</geogName>. Describing the waterway as having "the

                    </placeName> rendered the drinking water of Anderson unsafe for human consumption. The report also
                    substantiated Dale's claim that industry contributed heavily to the pollution. The Ball
                    Brothers Paper Mill and the Kuhner Packing Company, in which the fruit jar family had financial

                    persuade Mayor Dale of the necessity of building an expensive sewage treatment system. Legislation

            <p>In January, 1932, Congress created the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) and later authorized
                    that agency to extend loans for local, self-liquidating, public works. That same year in August the
                    Indiana General Assembly passed a law (amended in 1933) enabling Hoosier municipalities to build
                    sewage systems financed by special revenue bonds which could be sold to RFC.<hi rend="sup">75</hi>
                    Since the revenue bonds could be liquidated out of a special fund accumulated from fees paid by
                    sewer users, Dale envisioned construction of a sewage system without an increase in city taxes.<hi rend="sup">76</hi> Before <placeName>

                    the new agency to lend up to 70 percent of the cost of non-federal, public works, while the
                    remaining 30 percent could be donated as outright grants. From July, 1933, to March, 1939, 65

                    and establishing a rate schedule for sewer users. Continuing its prolonged confrontation with Dale,
                    the council procrastinated for ten months, resulting in cancellation of the grant and loan by PWA.
                    Among the leading opponents of the project was Clarence R. Hole, south side Democrat and chairman of
                    the council sewer committee, who objected to the proposed method of financing PWA bond-debt
                    liquidation because it would impose an inequitable hardship on residents of the south side.<hi rend="sup">79</hi>

            <p>Despite repeated warnings from PWA officials to take the required action or lose the grant and loan,
                    the council continued to delay. Out of desperation, Dale in August, 1934, appointed a special
                    citizens public safety committee consisting of seventy eminent residents, including George A. Ball
                    and the presidents of almost every civic organization in the community. Although members of this ad

                    </placeName> during the 1930s suggests that the Ball family never exercised the control over local
                    affairs that Robert and Helen Lynd indicated in <hi rend="i">

                    concerning municipal matters during George Dale's term as mayor from 1930 to 1935. Because
                    Dale could turn for help to agencies and institutions, both private and public, beyond the
                    boundaries of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>, he was able to enhance his influence in relation to that of the Balls. If <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Middletown</settlement>
                    </placeName> had been an isolated, self-contained city-state, the Lynds' image of Ball
                    family dominance might be more plausible. As Elazar has noted, however, American cities did not
                    exist in a vacuum. Communities such as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> were not autonomous but were parts of a larger and more complex political system. Under
                    these circumstances it was difficult for a local elite to reign supreme.<hi rend="sup">89</hi>
                    Nothing in these observations should be construed to insinuate that the Balls were without
                    considerable influence. Certainly their wealth and prestige enabled them to register a great amount
                    of clout in civic affairs. Yet in the community which many scholars tend to regard as the
                    personification of an elite-ridden society, there is room for reasonable doubt concerning the
                    untrammeled authority of the legendary "X family."</p>

                    </placeName> of the 1920s by the post office and a few agricultural technicians, has now become a
                    major presence, operating more than fifty different programs that affect the lives of every <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Middletown</settlement>
                    </placeName> resident in one way or another. Television, nonexistent in the 1920s, now claims a
                    substantial part of the waking time of both children and adults. It is impossible to ignore the
                    effect of influences emanating from metropolitan centers, but these outside influences are somehow
                    held in their peripheral position and kept separate from local institutions. Pornographic magazines,
                    for example, are freely available to the entire population and indeed constitute the most popular
                    recreational reading for male adolescents, who also have unlimited access to pornographic books and
                    motion pictures; there is a "sex shop" on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Middletown</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s new downtown mall. The clandestine fantasies of the 1920s have become public
                    entertainment in the 1970s, but no corresponding revolution in sexual norms has occurred. The same
                    rules of conduct still prevail, although they are somewhat less strictly enforced. The resistance to
                    outside influence appears in other institutional sectors. Local norms and values appear to change

            <p>The Lynds reported that the Christian fundamentalism of late nineteenth-century <placeName>

                    </placeName> had been severely eroded by 1924, and they apparently expected secularization to
                    continue until religion disappeared. As Table I shows, secularization did continue but in a
                    curiously selective way. The decline in religiosity has been negligible with respect to the
                    essential purpose of religion but has been somewhat greater with respect to the basic tenets of
                    Christian fundamentalism (items 3 and 4). A 20 percent decline over half a century, however, is not
                    spectacular, and about half of the change observed in item 3, a tenet basic to Protestant rather
                    than Catholic doctrine, is probably attributable to the increased proportion of Catholics in the
                    1977 population.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>

                    statement. Only with respect to item 2, which might be designated as religious chauvinism, and item
                    6 (the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Puritan</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Middletown</settlement>
                    </placeName> students now say that Christianity is the one true religion, and only a tiny minority
                    still regard Sunday movie-going as sinful.</p>
            <p>Although the numerical differences between the sexes are quite small in both sets of responses,
                    female respondents in 1924 showed more religiosity on every item than male respondents, whereas in
                    1977 the small differences by sex in the individual religion items balance each other out.</p>
            <p>The Lynds did not provide a breakdown of responses to their high school questionnaire by social
                    class, but elsewhere in <hi rend="i">
                        <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Middletown</settlement>
                        </placeName>
                    </hi> they described at length the greater religiosity of the working class compared to the business
                    class. The close association they observed between fundamentalist religion and working class status
                    has been echoed repeatedly in later studies. Yet, a breakdown of the 1977 responses indicated that
                    high school students with fathers in white collar occupations expressed about the same degree of
                    religiosity as students whose fathers followed blue collar occupations. In contemporary <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Middletown</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the religious values of the business class and the working class, at least as far as
                    they are reflected in high school student responses, seem to be nearly indentical.</p>
            <p>The five items under international politics are the least satisfactory of the set for comparative
                    purposes since, with one exception (item 8), the original statements had to be revised to take into
                    account a current international scene far different from that of the 1920s. In item 7, the
                    translation from 1924 to 1977 was oddly plausible. This was the Lynds' statement that
                    "The recent labor government in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> was a misfortune for <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>." The statement was applicable to 1977 with only a minor change of wording and
                    commanded a higher degree of agreement among students than it did in 1924. Parallels between World
                    War I and the <placeName>
                        <country reg="vm">North Vietnam</country>
                    </placeName> War attempted in items 9 and 10, however, were obviously weak, and it is doubtful
                    whether the responses tell anything at all about changing social values. It is curious that a much
                    lower proportion believed in the righteousness of the American cause in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="vm">North Vietnam</country>
                    </placeName> War than in World War I, but a significantly higher proportion attributed total
                    responsibility to the enemy in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="vm">North Vietnam</country>
                    </placeName> War than in World War I. Additionally, the finding that few students thought the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-ur">Soviet Union</country>
                    </placeName> should be recognized by the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in 1924, while 42 percent favored the recognition <pb n="350" id="VAA4025-075-4-055"/>
                    of <placeName>
                        <country reg="cc">China</country>
                    </placeName> in 1977 (item 11) is inconclusive since the situations are not closely comparable.</p>
            <p>Responses were more comparable between 1924 and 1977 on item 8. The proportion of students agreeing
                    that the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> was entirely right and that <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> was entirely wrong in the American Revolution was slightly higher in 1977 than it had
                    been five decades earlier. Almost half of the students agreed with this expression of national
                    chauvinism. The strength of this attitude is confirmed by responses to other items concerning
                    patriotism.</p>
            <p>The two items that tap conventional patriotic attitudes each show small declines from 1924 to 1977 in
                    the proportion of respondents agreeing, but it is striking how high a proportion of agreement
                    remains. Some readers may find it surprising that after all the political episodes of recent years
                    and the disillusion supposedly created by them, three out of four <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Middletown</settlement>
                    </placeName> high school students believe that the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> is unquestionably the best country in the world and that half of them accept the slogan
                    of "My country right or wrong" as a categorical imperative. Interestingly enough,
                    the female respondents of 1977 were somewhat less likely to express patriotic attitudes than male
                    respondents, whereas the female respondents of 1924 had been more inclined to the dominant beliefs.</p>
            <p>The impression that the basic political values of 1924 have persisted remarkably into the present era
                    is further supported by the pattern of response to items 14 and 15. Item 14 is a capsule version of
                    the Protestant ethic—"It is entirely the fault of the man himself if he does not
                    succeed." The proportion of students agreeing with the statement in 1977 was the same as in
                    1924, although once again this constancy was achieved by a significant increase in the proportion of
                    males, and a corresponding decrease in the proportion of females, who agreed. Fathers'
                    occupation had no discernible influence upon student responses to this item.</p>
            <p>There was a slight increase between 1924 and 1977 in the proportion of students who favored a change
                    in the existing distribution of wealth (item 15). Neither in 1924 nor 1977 was there much difference
                    between males and females in response to this item. However, fathers' occupation was highly
                    significant here: children of business class families were much less likely to favor a change in the
                    distribution of wealth than those of working class families.</p>
            <p>The above discussion of responses about religion noted that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Middletown</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s adolescents held much the same religious beliefs <pb n="351" id="VAA4025-075-4-056"/> as their grandparents and held them almost as strongly but appeared
                    less inclined to impose these beliefs on others. The same drift toward tolerance appears in the
                    responses to the two items on civil rights. The proportion of students who would prosecute war-time
                    pacifists or conscientious objectors was much lower in 1977 than in 1924, and the proportion
                    favoring unlimited free speech was much higher although still falling short of a majority. The
                    male/female differential increased for both items. Social class evidently exerted an ambiguous
                    influence, with students from white collar families more likely to support the rights of
                    conscientious objectors but less inclined to favor unlimited free speech.</p>
            <p>The questions included three items about students' confidence in sources of information on
                    public issues: one dealing with <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Middletown</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s principal morning newspaper (which has changed very little in format and
                    editorial posture since 1924); one about the campaign speeches of political candidates; and another
                    about national magazines, substituting <hi rend="i">Time</hi> and <hi rend="i">Newsweek</hi> in 1977
                    for <hi rend="i">Saturday Evening Post</hi> and <hi rend="i">American Magazine</hi> in 1924. Again
                    the results controvert the common expectation. The students of 1977 expressed significantly more
                    confidence in the newspaper and campaign speeches as sources of information than did the students of
                    1924. They were less sure about the correctness of statements appearing in national magazines, which
                    may have something to do with the particular examples selected.</p>
            <p>These data, of course, are sparse and incomplete, but they are quantitative data of reasonable
                    quality and probably more reliable than the surmises about the attitudes of our grandparents on
                    which we usually rely when assessing the force and direction of social change. The fifty-three year
                    interval between the two surveys is just about the length of two generations in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Middletown</settlement>
                    </placeName> and, indeed, about 30 percent of the respondents in the 1977 sample were in fact the
                    grandchildren of one or more respondents to the 1924 sample. Few of them appear aware of the
                    similarity between their own religious, political, and social attitudes and those of their
                    grandparents. That similarity, so contradictory to current popular beliefs about "future
                    shock" and "the disappearance of traditional values," calls for
                    explanation.</p>
            <p>The principal motor of social change in the twentieth century is modernization, assisted here and
                    there by social revolution and population shifts. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Middletown</settlement>
                    </placeName> has not undergone a revolution and its population has been relatively stable. It may
                        <pb n="352" id="VAA4025-075-4-057"/> be inferred, therefore, that the prevailing rate of social
                    change has been determined by the rate of modernization and, if there has been a deceleration of
                    social change during the past fifty years, it is probably attributable to the slowing down of the
                    modernization process. The next step then is to measure the rate of modernization in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Middletown</settlement>
                    </placeName> during the past half century to determine if there was, in fact, a deceleration. This
                    procedure sounds straightforward, but in practice it involves a number of problems.</p>
            <p>Modernization may be defined as the process whereby a contemporary society improves its control of
                    the environment by means of an increasingly competent technology applied by increasingly complex
                    organizations. Note that the process of modernization is held to occur only in nineteenth-and
                    twentieth-century societies and that the definition assumes modernization to be continuous and
                    unidirectional, leaving no room for the possibility that an increasingly competent technology might
                    be applied by decreasingly complex organizations, or the possibility that control of the environment
                    might deteriorate in the presence of increasingly complex organizations. These assumptions have been
                    reasonable up to and including the present, but they can no longer be projected into the future with
                    much confidence.</p>
            <p>To measure the rate of modernization in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Middletown</settlement>
                    </placeName> from 1925 to 1975, it is necessary to devise quantitative measures for the implied
                    variable "control of the environment." To do this is to abandon the broad concept
                    of "control of the environment" in favor of specific indicators that report
                    particular kinds of controlling activity but that probably do not tell the whole story about the
                    relationship of man and environment and how that relationship evolved in a high energy social
                    system.</p>
            <p>The statistical measures of modernization used here are not designed to take account of the
                    possibility that the improved control of the environment associated with the unique historical
                    process called modernization works effectively in some but not all sectors of the man-environment
                    relationship. The indicators of modernization do not take account of one important aspect of the
                    history of modernization, namely that a short-term improvement in environmental control may be
                    directly responsible for a long-term deterioration in environmental control. The whaler's
                    control of the environment improves as he progresses from a rowing boat and a handthrown harpoon to
                    a fast motor boat and an explosive lance, but within a few decades his control of the environment
                    deteriorates dramatically <pb n="353" id="VAA4025-075-4-058"/> as the whales disappear. Similarly,
                    control of the social environment is greatly enhanced by the intense bureaucratization of
                    governments and other large-scale organizations, but the vulnerability of such organizations to
                    natural and contrived disasters may eventually make them unworkable.</p>
            <p>These dangers are real and serious, but they should not frighten us into denying the ubiquity of
                    technological progress in the modern world and the still increasing availability of a still
                    increasing supply of goods and services to a still increasing population. As Jean

                    are energy consumption per capita, agricultural productivity per acre, industrial productivity per
                    man hour, life expectancy at birth, infant mortality (inverse), physicians per capita, all measures
                    of formal education, the intensity of occupational specialization, calories consumed per capita,
                    durable goods consumed per capita, per capita readership of printed media, per capita exposure to
                    mass media, passenger miles traveled per capita, the ratio of paid vacation to work time, the
                    proportion of the population urbanized, the proportion of the labor force in tertiary occupations,
                    and the inverse of the proportion of the labor force in strenuous occupations.</p>
            <p>Although most indicators of these come in handy quantified form, they suffer from many defects. It
                    can never be safely assumed, for example, that an increase of <hi rend="i">n</hi> units from time
                    period one to time period two has the same social or psychological impact as an increase of <hi rend="i">n</hi> units in the same indicator from time period two to time period three. The
                    indicator may have less, or more, or be incommensurate, depending on the overall shape of the curve
                    and a variety of qualitative factors. To take two examples at random: an increase of 1 or 2 percent
                    in literacy when a society's literacy rate stands close to 100 percent is much more
                    significant than the same percentage increase would have been at an earlier point in the
                    society's history when illiteracy was prevalent. Likewise, a decrease in energy consumption
                    per capita may signal more technological progress than an increase once the supply of energy has
                    begun to run short.</p>
            <p>It is much easier to measure changes in the level of modernization from one period to another than to
                    link such measurements to the subjective experience of participants. The question whether the
                    generation born in 1880 experienced more or less modernization than the generation born in 1930
                    invites a comparison of the subjective experience of one set of persons at one time with the
                    subjective experience of another set of persons at another time, and it is difficult to see how any
                    conclusion drawn from such a comparison could be convincingly verified. The exercise may be worth
                    attempting but not until analysis of the hard data about rates of modernization is completed and the
                    subjective reactions of participants are placed within a solid informational framework.</p>
            <p>Such a framework must take into account the curious arithmetical relationship between absolute and
                    relative increments in a growth curve, especially that:</p>
            <pb n="355" id="VAA4025-075-4-060"/>
            <p>(1) A constant <hi rend="i">increment</hi> of growth maintained through a series of equal,
                    consecutive, time-intervals results in continuous growth at a continuously declining rate. This is
                    the arithmetic that underlies the law of diminishing returns, the Malthusian theory of food supply,
                    and the history of industrial productivity in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>(2) A constant <hi rend="i">rate</hi> of growth maintained through a series of equal, consecutive,
                    time-intervals results in increasing increments of growth from each time-interval to the next. In
                    the early stages of growth at a constant rate, the increases are small but they soon become so large
                    that continued growth at the same constant rate becomes literally impossible. This is the arithmetic
                    behind the Gompertz curve and the numerous curves for the growth of populations, artifacts, and
                    symbols that accelerate for a while and then flatten out.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> It is also the basis
                    of what may be called Khruschev's fallacy, the expectation that a less modernized society
                    with a high growth rate will soon overtake a more modernized society with a lower growth rate.</p>
            <p>Taken together, these two principles suggest that when persons living in a society that has been
                    modernizing for several generations compare their later experiences with their earlier experiences,
                    or their own experiences with those of their parents or grandparents, they will be influenced by two
                    trends that are arithmetically inseparable but psychologically divergent: decreasing rates of change
                    and increasing increments of change. For example, the population of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Middletown</settlement>
                    </placeName> increased by 15 percent in the decade ending in 1910 and by only 12 percent in the ten
                    years ending in 1975, but only three thousand people were added to the population in the decade
                    ending 1910 compared to nearly nine thousand people in the later period.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> The
                    increase in motor vehicles in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Middletown</settlement>
                    </placeName> from 1960 to 1970 was fourteen thousand while the increase from 1925 to 1935 had been
                    only five thousand, but the increase in the earlier decade represented an annual growth rate of

                    ratios. If we have a roughly constant number of friends, relatives, and acquaintances, the number
                    who acquire a car for the first time will decline from year to year. People whose ambience is
                    composed of a relatively small number of people in relatively fixed roles, like stockbrokers and
                    barbers, are likely to be less aware of social change than people whose ambiences are fluid and
                    amorphous, like salesmen and sociologists.</p>
            <p>The foregoing discussion is, of course, grossly oversimplified inasmuch as the changes in social
                    experience associated with modernization are qualitative as well as quantitative. They include new
                    varieties of experience, like television and space travel, and old experiences that acquire new
                    qualities by virtue of scale or technological intensity, like travel on freeways or problem-solving
                    on a computer. Moreover, every sustained growth process affecting human experience has points of
                    inflection at which a small quantitative change is equivalent to a significant qualitative change;
                    for example, that point in the growth of a small community beyond which new settlers no longer
                    attract general notice. These are not trivial phenomena, but in view of the inherent tendencies
                    toward distorted perception we have been reviewing (and others that remain undiscussed, such as the
                    tendency for perceptions of change to be affected by political preferences) we are again well
                    advised to build any qualitative description of social change on a firm foundation of quantitative
                    measurement.</p>
            <p>When these tactics are adopted with regard to the half century of social change between the
                    Lynds' administration of the high school survey in <placeName>

                    </placeName> in 1924 and the 1977 survey the results are unequivocal. Every quantitative measure of
                    modernization shows an overall deceleration from the 1920s to the 1970s. For example, there were
                    .216 telephones per capita of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Middletown</settlement>
                    </placeName> population in 1925. By the mid-point of the period, 1950, this had increased to .359
                    telephones per capita, equivalent to an uncompounded annual increase of 2.6 percent for the first
                    twenty-five years. From 1950 to 1975 there was a further increase from .359 to .448, an average
                    annual rate of just under 1 percent. From 1970 to 1975, there was actually a slight decline in the
                    number of telephones per capita.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>

                    was 15 percent during the first half of the period and a little over 3 percent during the second
                    half. This particular trend is especially notable in view of the enormous volume of public funds
                    appropriated for hospital construction and medical care during the second half of the period.</p>
            <p>Passenger automobiles provide a nearly perfect illustration of one of the situations described
                    above—a constant increment of growth resulting in continuous growth at a continuously
                    declining rate. The number of passenger automobiles per capita in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Middletown</settlement>
                    </placeName> increased from .266 in 1925 to .487 in 1950 to .747 in 1975, in nearly constant
                    increments of around .010 per year but at an annual rate declining from an average of 4 percent in
                    the first half of the period to 2 percent in the second half.</p>
            <p>Another good indicator of modernization in advanced societies where most young children attend school
                    is the number of adolescents in school compared to those gainfully employed. In the decade 1920 to
                    1930, this ratio for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Middletown</settlement>
                    </placeName> increased from .158 to .365 at an average rate of 23 percent per year. In the decade
                    1960 to 1970, it increased from 1.71 to 2.47 at an average rate of 4 percent per year.</p>
            <p>These measures could be multiplied almost indefinitely, but the general finding would in nearly every
                    case be the same. The people of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Middletown</settlement>
                    </placeName> have been experiencing decelerating social change. This sober fact, which stands in
                    such glaring contrast to the fevered stereotypes of the "future shock" theorists,
                    goes far to explain the stability of attitudes and values described at the beginning of this essay. <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s adolescents have experienced less social change than their parents and much
                    less than their urbanized grandparents, without taking any account of the cataclysmic transformation
                    experienced by their great grandparents—from a predominantly rural to a predominantly
                    urban society and from an economy based on muscular effort to one dependent on mechanical power.</p>
            <p>As its population growth slows down and as relatively constant increments to the various indicators

            <p>James B. Lane has put together a human interest story of Gary, Indiana. Drawn from Lane's
                    popular weekly newspaper column in the Gary <hi rend="i">Post-Tribune</hi>, the book strives to tell
                    the city's story in dozens of chronologically arranged vignettes. Beginning with the
                    founder, Judge Elbert H. Gary, Lane recounts colorfully and zestfully the trials and triumphs of
                    individual Garyites.</p>
            <p>Founded as a company town by <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Steel in 1906, Gary has remained a one-industry town for all of its short seventy-year
                    history. Lacking an important state or regional function, not serving as a transportation hub or
                    educational center, and not functioning as a market center for agriculture, Gary's primary
                    purpose has been to transform raw iron ore into steel. Overshadowed by other metropolises such as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> and dwarfed even by Indiana's own metropolis, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Gary never grew beyond its founding purpose.</p>
            <p>One of the results of this peculiar dependency upon one industry was that Gary, the "instant
                    city," passed from birth to adolescence to middle age and into old age and decay in a mere
                    seventy years. Lane does not address these macro questions as such but instead focuses on human
                    interest stories of people who lived through these growth phases of the city's history.
                    Seeking representative residents of the city for each period, he writes of the Arlene Draves murder
                    case, of Tony Zale, John Dillinger, and Tom Harmon in addition to dozens of less renowned citizens.
                    Therein lies both a strength and a weakness of the book. The vignettes hold the reader's
                    attention nicely but sometimes fail to convey the big picture effectively. Lane could have connected
                    his word portraits more directly to the demographic and economic realities of each period.</p>
            <p>One of the most interesting and valuable parts of the book chronicles the political era from Mayor
                    George Chacharis to Mayor Richard C. Hatcher. Seen up close, the "warts and all"
                    picture of Hatcher is considerably less flattering than is his national image. Like most politicians
                    of his time, Hatcher promised more than he could deliver, and his 1960s rhetoric sounds quaintly out
                    of key with the realities of the 1970s. No urban wizard but probably an improvement over his
                    predecessors, Hatcher did the best he could with difficult circumstances. Even so, the stubborn and
                    unyielding character of the urban <pb n="359" id="VAA4025-075-4-064"/> malaise soon deflated the
                    mayor's campaign promises. "In 13 months," Hatcher declared,
                    "I've learned there are some problems that have no solution" (p. 295).
                    Perhaps Hatcher's frustrations over Gary lie in the fact that, as Lane writes, the city was
                    founded on high expectations as an "experiment in industrial urban planning, but the city
                    never fulfilled the hopes of its pioneer boosters. Rather in its travail, it came to symbolize the
                    plight of the twentieth-century cities" (p. xi).</p>
            <p>Lane's book makes available at a reasonable price the modern story of Gary.</p>

                    ridicule at worst. Too personal, brief, episodic, and unanalytical to be good history, they were
                    relegated to that wide readership known as the popular audience. Richard J. Jensen's book
                    is an exception.</p>
            <p>Jensen explains <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>' history in terms of modernization theory. He emphasizes personality types:
                    the southerners who invaded the lower part of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> and who constituted a predominantly traditionalist element, and the northerners,
                    predominately modernists, who settled north of where Interstate 70 is now located. Jensen also
                    attempts to relate the traditionalist-modern model to ethnoreligious groups (the Jews do not fit).
                    He also postulates a postmodern model with evidence derived for the recent past. All of this is
                    heady stuff for a book in a series funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities and intended
                    to provide narrative history or biography.</p>
            <p>The real question is, does Jensen pull it off? Well, he does a fairly good job; he makes a lively
                    case, but in the end he is unconvincing. This may not be his fault. He probably had a shoot-out with
                    the editors of the series and had to compromise by introducing <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>' better-known personalities. (Social scientists have pejorative things to say
                    about practitioners who try to make individuals fit generalizations.) Nevertheless, Jensen certainly
                    raises the level of discourse above that of the <pb n="360" id="VAA4025-075-4-065"/> other volumes
                    in the series. As a result, in many ways this is the best interpretive one-volume state history
                    around. It would be a shame if scholars and intelligent lay readers missed it because it appears in
                    a popular series.</p>
            <p>How can Jensen's book be at once among the best of the state histories and at the same time
                    unconvincing: simply because Jensen raises the right questions but cannot answer them in a manner
                    that will win over the bulk of his readers. Every reader will praise his genuine effort to impart
                    meaning and content to events over time, not merely to chronicle them. He will be commended too for
                    not being so simplistic as to paint his regions or groups in monolithic terms. The difficulty will
                    come when readers seek to reconcile much of what he says with what they already know. It is not only
                    that Abraham Lincoln is an anomaly in the nineteenth century, as Jensen points out, but that Henry
                    Horner is even more out of phase. The author's categories for analyzing the twentieth
                    century are too loose to be convincing.</p>
            <p>The reader should be aware that Jensen's suggested further readings, presented at the end of
                    the book, have virtually nothing in common with the sources for his study. The book derives from a
                    deep knowledge of traditional historical studies as well as recent behaviorial works, especially
                    polls and voter analyses. Therefore the book warrants very careful reading because many of
                    Jensen's observations are far from casual; they are based on his own meticulous
                    scholarship. Unfortunately, he occasionally overlooks a bit of evidence that would have made his
                    case more effective. What, for example, could have been more a symbol of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s modernist leadership than the city's motto, I WILL, or its perhaps
                    now forgotten song, a line or so of which runs: "She aims to be far more than brick or
                    stone/A victory, a bugle forward blown."</p>
            <p>Donald Getsug's photographic essay is a disappointment. He should have read the book. He
                    might have taken some pictures at the corner of 1045 North <placeName>

            <p>Few politicians or statesmen have achieved the fame of a Daniel Webster. At a time when the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> struggled to establish a sense of identity, the "Godlike Daniel"
                    emerged as a potent national symbol, famed for his oratorical prowess and his stirring debates in
                    Congress. Symbol he has remained in most accounts of his life and that of the infant republic. In
                    this graceful and stylistic biography, Irving H. Bartlett tries to place the symbolism in
                    perspective and help readers to see "the man behind the image, who succeeded, failed,
                    laughed, loved and sometimes found himself ensnared in webs of his own making but beyond his
                    understanding" (p. 11). In large measure, Bartlett's venture proves successful; he
                    has brought the reader to a new understanding of this powerful and influential public figure.</p>
            <p>In assessing Webster's public career and private life, Bartlett wants to answer a
                    fundamental and disturbing question: how could a politician so lionized in his own day fail to win
                    the presidency, a prize Webster coveted intensely? Bartlett sees the answer in the nature of the
                    image itself. Webster's status as a powerful, eloquent, and dynamic statesman was often at
                    odds with the democratic tendancies of the era, where political fortunes came to rest on the need
                    for humble origins. Webster may have learned to wear the coonskin cap, but it never fit comfortably.
                    As the supreme orator and senatorial gladiator, Webster was too closely tied to the established
                    structures of wealth and political bureaucracy. His fame became a two-edged sword, able to humble
                    less talented adversaries but always subject to misrepresentation as aristocratic ambition in
                    democratic disguise. Webster's Federalist heritage, his ties to the Second Bank of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, and his chronic financial problems made him an easy target for political enemies.</p>
            <p>Persuasive though Bartlett's analysis is, it does not penetrate very far beneath the surface
                    of the image. The author skillfully unravels the layers of fiscal indebtedness that plagued Webster
                    throughout life yet rarely pauses to speculate about the origin or significance of this spendthrift
                    behavior. Similarly, Bartlett charts Webster's political progress but not his motives nor
                    the compelling irony of the independent, stentorian statesman who placed himself in such debt to his
                    friends and supporters. Such concerns would have carried Bartlett away from political narrative, at
                    which he excels, into the <pb n="362" id="VAA4025-075-4-067"/> realm of intellectual and
                    psychosocial history, where he seems uncomfortable. Bartlett's biography is clearly the
                    best one-volume life of Webster. It is stimulating, well-written, and carefully researched. That it
                    raises more questions that it answers is in part a measure of the book's success.</p>

                    bibliography, index. $15.00.)</head>
            <p>This is a book with one over-riding thesis. Economics, G. S. Boritt insists, was central to the
                    beliefs and faith of Abraham Lincoln, or, put another way, "the <hi rend="i">right to
                    rise</hi> [which Boritt views solely in economic terms] … was Lincoln's central
                    ideal" (p. 281). Lincoln's central ideal was also that of America. The right to
                    rise, the right to get ahead in life—in short, the American Dream—was the
                    central ideal of the Republic, and it was Lincoln who made it so. No one, Boritt suggests,
                    "placed the Dream so clearly on the highest pedestal as the <hi rend="i">central idea</hi>
                    of the Republic" (p. 160); more than anyone else Lincoln "helped institutionalize
                    the American Dream—made it perhaps the most <hi rend="i">central idea</hi> of the
                    nation" (p. 161). It was Lincoln "who uplifted America's coarse
                    materialism and gave it a spiritual dimension" (p. 160). It was Lincoln who extended the
                    Jeffersonian meaning of equality to encompass equality of opportunity, which Boritt feels may be
                    "one of the most important metamorphoses of an idea in American history" (p. 158).
                    In fact, Lincoln himself was not fully aware of his "creative approach" to
                    Jefferson's dictum. To support these contentions Boritt has painstakingly combed the
                    Lincoln literature, amassing evidence from Lincoln's own words and from the words of those
                    who knew him and remembered him. The result is a truly formidable array of documentation,
                    demonstrating the central importance of economics to Lincoln's outlook from his early
                    career as an <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> legislator to the end of his presidential years.</p>
            <p>While the course of Boritt's reasoning is not always clear, it is apparent that he has both
                    his subject and his sources well in hand. There are pitfalls, however, in Boritt's
                    approach, and he does not always avoid them. To prove his case he frequently employs a type of
                    selective quotation, piling up citations without regard for their contexts. His zeal at times leads
                    him into <pb n="363" id="VAA4025-075-4-068"/> hyperbole. There are instances when his efforts to tie
                    Lincoln's thought to economic roots seem contrived and artificial (as when Boritt finds the
                    "right to rise" in the president's military policies, a discovery which
                    Boritt himself found startling). Boritt tends to view Lincoln's development in isolation
                    from the intellectual and cultural currents of early nineteenth-century America, a lack of
                    perspective that easily tempts him to exaggerate Lincoln's uniqueness. Still, this is a
                    valuable study if only because it fills out a dimension of Lincoln's thought that has
                    received little emphasis before now. Lincoln's early support of Whig economics is given
                    careful analysis; the economics that directed his stance on slavery, his concept of the Union, and
                    his view of the nature of the Civil War are revealed. Appended to Boritt's study is an
                    extended essay in which the author seeks the "historiographical ancestry" of his
                    book. Why, he asks, had not Lincoln scholars before him discovered the essential importance of
                    economics to Lincoln's thought and action? The answer, he suggests, is found in the
                    persistent and overpowering duality of the Lincoln image, Lincoln as man and Lincoln as god. His
                    book, Boritt feels, not only explodes the "myth of the noneconomic Lincoln" but
                    also provides "the sturdiest support for the bridge between man and god" (p. 304).
                    That Boritt has made a contribution to Lincoln studies is unquestioned; that he has succeeded in his
                    aim "to find a more real, more believable, Lincoln" is less certain.</p>

               <hi rend="i">R. E. Olds: Auto Industry Pioneer.</hi> By George S. May. (Grand Rapids, Mich.:
                    William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1977. Pp. viii, 458. Illustrations, appendix, bibliography,
                    notes, index. $13.95.)</head>
            <p>Ransom E. Olds has long remained an enigmatic figure in the history of American automobiles. George
                    S. May's richly detailed biography indicates that Olds shared much with Henry Ford: age and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> residency, an aversion to farm life, mechanical training, and early experience with
                    automobiles. Olds built his first car a decade before Ford and was even better equipped to dominate
                    the new industry. From the 1880s he had superintended the manufacture of nationally known steam and
                    gasoline engines in his father's firm. His experience and reputation helped him found the
                    Olds Motor Vehicle Company and capture one third of annual industry sales before Ford was firmly
                    established.</p>
            <pb n="364" id="VAA4025-075-4-069"/>
            <p>Yet his initial success marked Olds' peak influence. In 1904 he split with his backers,
                    Samuel and Fred Smith, and left the firm. And although he quickly founded another company (the REO,
                    an acronym of Olds' initials), it never ranked higher than third in the industry. After
                    1906 Olds became less active as his company fell behind the new industry leaders, Ford and General
                    Motors. May's more abbreviated coverage of Olds' later career describes only an
                    ineffectual return to active management shortly before Olds left REO in 1936.</p>
            <p>Why then did a man of such obvious capabilities and advantages fail to achieve the leadership and
                    stature of a Ford? May answers that Olds was an early leader but not the towering pioneer of legend.
                    Olds did not build the first gasoline automobile, and he produced an insignificant number of cars
                    before settling on his famous curved-dash model just prior to his disastrous factory fire in 1901.
                    That car, which made Olds' reputation, was neither the only cheap model nor the first
                    automobile produced in quantity. Olds' swift departure from the Olds Motor Vehicle Company
                    resulted not from a stubborn conviction for inexpensive, mass-produced vehicles but from a power
                    struggle with Fred Smith. And Olds' diminished role at REO was by choice. After pioneering
                    two firms he had little patience with administrative routine and less taste for such controversies
                    as the Selden patent fight.</p>
            <p>May's evidence could have carried him further. Olds was a production man of limited vision,
                    not an entrepreneur of boundless confidence. While he forecast industry sales of a quarter million,
                    Ford and William C. Durant foresaw a market twice as large. Olds was slow to improve his original
                    engine and his frail runabout. For him, producing a dependable car meant building a bigger, more
                    expensive automobile. Ironically, he began to miss the challenge of innovation just when Ford began
                    modifying technology to produce cheap, dependable vehicles.</p>
            <p>A more focused account would have sharpened May's analysis of a pioneer who stopped
                    pioneering too soon, a genial fellow who fought bitterly with close colleagues, a critic of his
                    father's docility who was prematurely content, and an independent who truckled to the
                    Selden group. Yet while Olds remains an elusive figure, May's well-written book has much to
                    offer. Unless new material is uncovered, scholars will not have a better history of Olds'
                    early career. Along with Glenn Niemeyer's 1963 study, May has filled gaps and helped
                    de-mythologize an important precursor's story. More importantly <pb n="365" id="VAA4025-075-4-070"/> the sharp contrast of Olds with Ford and Durant illuminates the role of
                    personality and individual choice in business leadership.</p>

                    Gould. (<placeName>

                    index. Clothbound, $10.95; paperbound, $6.95.)</head>
            <p>American political history, like other fields, has been influenced by historians using social science
                    methodology and emphasizing general patterns, state politics, electoral behavior, and legislative
                    roll-call voting. By this standard Lewis L. Gould's <hi rend="i">Reform and Regulation</hi>
                    is clearly a traditional work. Of course, as his bibliography and footnotes indicate, Gould is
                    familiar with much of the "new" political history, especially the literature on
                    the 1890s. Thus, he quite rightly begins in 1896 instead of 1900, the date apparently chosen by the
                    series editor. (This is one of eight projected volumes entitled <hi rend="i">Critical Episodes in
                        American Politics.</hi>) Gould's reading has failed him, however, with regard to
                    elections. While his descriptions of platforms, speeches, and party organization are insightful, he
                    appears to view election results as essentially referenda on national, and largely economic, issues.
                    Such a view neglects the role of social and moral questions evident in many states, including
                    Indiana. Moreover, Gould ignores almost entirely the importance of political socialization. He
                    mentions the decline of party loyalty and voter turnout but fails to appreciate the broader
                    significance of these developments. Finally, his suggestion that the Democratic victory in 1916 was
                    only an "interruption" (p. 178) in a Republican era ignores the pattern of
                    elections from 1908 to 1918, a pattern which Indiana well exemplifies. Despite its subtitle,
                    however, this book covers not American politics but presidential politics. Judged by this narrower
                    standard, <hi rend="i">Reform and Regulation</hi> is both useful and significant. Gould has read
                    widely in manuscript collections and periodicals. His evaluations are perceptive, and his noting of
                    long-range consequences is valuable.</p>
            <p>Gould is very critical of Theodore Roosevelt. He argues convincingly that TR's initial
                    policies, especially regarding trusts, were common Republican doctrine. Although admitting
                    Roosevelt's astute assessment of public opinion and his successful self-advertisement,
                    Gould claims that the president was <pb n="366" id="VAA4025-075-4-071"/> a poor manager of Congress
                    and the party and a bad judge of character. His actions divided the GOP, and in failing to revise
                    the tariff he set the stage for a more serious crisis.</p>
            <p>The portrait of William Howard Taft is perceptive and sympathetic. Deftly outlining the many causes
                    of animosity between Taft and the progressives, the author explains the president's view of
                    his role: administrator, quiet negotiator, and party leader. This approach, in the face of the
                    rising expectations and antipartisan sentiment of the progressives, made him appear obstructive and
                    forced him to rely on conservatives. Ultimately, Gould blames Roosevelt for the 1912 split. His
                    presidency had fostered conflict, and his subsequent activities, more for personal than policy
                    reasons, divided the party and devastated its progressive wing.</p>
            <p>Gould presents Woodrow Wilson as an effective leader and flexible thinker. During Wilson's
                    first term, according to Gould, modern politics finally emerged, as many interest groups sought
                    federal assistance. The Wilsonian coalition disintegrated, but big-government advocates remained
                    dominant among Democrats and subordinate in the GOP. Gould is here exaggerating precedent into
                    transition, but he is correct on a very important point: the nature of politics had changed.</p>

            <p>This compact monograph offers historians a fascinating "photograph" of the agency
                    and individuals who conducted American diplomacy in 1913–1914. The result is not
                    flattering to the Department of State or to the administration of President Woodrow Wilson.</p>
            <p>In 1914 the department was small. There were 213 officers, clerks, and messengers in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>; another 450 served abroad. West indicates that a traditional emphasis on Latin
                    American and Far Eastern relations led to understaffing in the bureaus responsible for European
                    affairs.</p>
            <p>Along with organizational shortcomings, there were other serious problems. "The sheer
                    amateurism of the department, the blindness of the highest officials—these stand
                    out" (p. 3). Diplomats stationed abroad corresponded with <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> on routine matters—visas and commercial listings—but hesitated to
                    communicate on more significant matters, fearing their <pb n="367" id="VAA4025-075-4-072"/> words
                    would be lost in a bureaucratic pigeonhole or even rebuked. For instance, in July, 1914, Frank
                    Mallett, vice-consul in Budapest, became the first <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

                        <region type="state" reg="au">Austria</region>
                    </placeName> and Serbia. He sent this important dispatch to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> by ordinary mail, not by cable. His warning exceeded the length expected of cables, and
                    Mallet did not want to violate a regulation.</p>
            <p>In the summer of 1914 West shows that the department was unprepared for war and unconcerned about a
                    threat to world peace. Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan talked domestic politics at work
                    and devoted weekends to earning additional income with speeches on peace, temperance, and the good
                    life. Inexperienced officials handled department business while Counselor Robert Lansing vacationed
                    in <placeName>

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> was not well staffed to protect national interests or promote peaceful solutions to
                    disputes. Major diplomatic posts went to large political contributors, and there were inexperienced
                    political appointees in all significant European capitals except <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In Berlin, Ambassador James Gerard, who gained his appointment with the backing of
                    Tammany Hall, lacked the president's confidence. Nor was he prescient. Gerard watched
                    German military maneuvers with the kaiser and in July pronounced Berlin "as quiet as a
                    grave" (p. 131). In St. Petersburg, where the Wilson administration needed an experienced
                    diplomatic hand, there was no ambassador until after the war began.</p>
            <p>This book, although narrow in scope, is thorough and professional, based as it is on extensive
                    research in primary sources and English-language materials. The conclusions reinforce earlier
                    interpretations but add significant detail that will benefit historians desiring anecdotes for
                    classroom lectures. There is a minor weakness. The index contains only proper names and is not a
                    useful guide to the volume's rich contents.</p>

            <p>Richard Lowitt can now relax. After two decades of research and writing he has finished his
                    magisterial trilogy on <pb n="368" id="VAA4025-075-4-073"/> George W. Norris. This final volume
                    covers Norris' years of triumph as a Progressive reformer during the New Deal. The
                    senator's long political labors finally bore fruit for a better America, and
                    Lowitt's productive scholarship will, likewise, nourish students for years to come.</p>
            <p>Norris' triumphs as well as his failures are chronicled in Lowitt's work, and the
                    combination guarantees the senator a large degree of immortality. Franklin D. Roosevelt correctly
                    called him "one of the major prophets of America" (p. 156). After years of
                    minority advocacy he found himself leading a majority in 1933, and his dreams became law. The <placeName>

                    would continue his work to abolish the electoral college, divorce welfare from politics, and place
                    greater controls on utility trusts and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. His career was a
                    nonpartisan crusade for good government and citizens' rights and can be summarized in the
                    words he used to describe his beloved TVA: "a shining example of efficiency and

            <p>A major strength of this book is Lowitt's ability to view federal activity from state and

                    Public Works Administration. The author also demonstrates how fickle constituents can be. Cornhusker
                    rejections of Roosevelt's candidacy in the 1940 election and Norris' bid for a
                    sixth term in 1942 are both explained convincingly as rural Republican frustration with New Deal
                    bureaucracy.</p>
            <p>The two previous volumes in this exhaustive biography set standards which are maintained in the
                    concluding work. Lowitt's mastery of source material is obvious; his footnotes are
                    impressive in their thoroughness; and his publisher is to be commended for placing them at the
                    bottom of the pages where they belong. The author, unfortunately, continues to plod chronologically
                    through massive details, many of which could be discarded with no damage to the subject. Historians
                    will need to be familiar with the earlier works to understand fully Norris the man; only the senator
                    is visible from 1933 to 1944. And it should come as no surprise that the author's favorable
                    bias grows to adulation by the final chapter.</p>
            <pb n="369" id="VAA4025-075-4-074"/>
            <p>These small caveats aside, the book is rich, comprehensive, and judicious. Other studies pale in all
                    comparisons. Nature blessed Norris with a long and successful life; Lowitt now blesses him with a
                    similar biography.</p>

            <p>All three of these books reflect the increasing interest historians are devoting to community and
                    family history in their research and in college classrooms. David J. Russo's <hi rend="i">Families and Communities</hi> is a combination of a bibliographic essay and a call for a new
                    approach to writing American history. He spends several chapters surveying the manner in which
                    historians have treated various levels of communities, such as towns, cities, states, and regions.
                    His conclusion is "that Americans have always lived simultaneously in various levels of
                    communities and that the level of most consequence has shifted from the little
                    community—the town—to the big community—the nation" (pp.
                    155–56).</p>
            <p>Russo maintains that most textbook writers have concentrated on a national frame of reference with a
                    heavy emphasis on political events. Such an emphasis, he feels, has actually distorted American
                    history. He argues that the national community did not become dominant until somewhere between 1870
                    and 1930. To emphasize the nation-state from the colonial period to the present is, therefore,
                    inaccurate. Russo calls for a new scheme that focuses on the individual, the family, and the levels
                    of community in which they have lived, with the emphasis <pb n="370" id="VAA4025-075-4-075"/>
                    gradually shifting from the town to the city to states to regions and finally to the nation. He
                    promises that this approach will reveal more about the history of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> than do our present texts.</p>
            <p>Russo acknowledges several potential problem areas for those working to develop this new scheme. One
                    of the main problems will be the creation of a proper balance between dramatic events and the normal
                    functioning of individuals, groups, and institutions. In this area he warns against giving
                    preponderance to political affairs. Russo calls on historians to be sensitive to the complex
                    interplay among political, economic, social, cultural, and intellectual forces; to ascertain the
                    direction of various influences; and to distinguish between the causes of change and the reflections
                    of change. Establishing a proper balance between elitist history and mass history is a third problem
                    to which writers of the new history should respond. A main deficiency of current texts, according to
                    Russo, is their periodization. He suggests dividing American history into four periods: colonial,
                    the Revolution to the Civil War, Civil War to World War II, and World War II to the present. These
                    longer periods would allow historians to gain a better perspective as to the ways in which major
                    changes were related to each other.</p>
            <p>David E. Kyvig and Myron A. Marty have put together a fine little book in <hi rend="i">Your Family
                        History: A Handbook for Research and Writing.</hi> This slim volume is a good handbook either
                    for a supplemental project on family history in a survey course or as part of the reading for a
                    community or oral history course. The authors blend basic, nuts-and-bolts information on family
                    research with brief introductions to historical methodology and bibliographic information on major
                    works in family and community history. The student is systematically brought through a family
                    history research project from selecting a topic to using various sources of information and
                    techniques of research. Examples of different resources such as photographs and oral interviews
                    illustrate the authors' approach. This book is a nice example of its type, easily read and
                    reasonably priced. It is strongly recommended to anyone who is contemplating involving students in a
                    family history research project.</p>
            <p>Jim Watts and Allen F. Davis have developed a larger and more comprehensive reader in <hi rend="i">Generations.</hi> This book is designed for use as a main source book or text in a family
                    history course. The authors teach at urban universities, Watts at City College of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> and Davis at Temple, and the reader <pb n="371" id="VAA4025-075-4-076"/> senses an
                    urban orientation in the construction of this volume, which deals with the problems of immigration,
                    work and unemployment, and war, as they influence the family. However, rural poverty and the rural
                    to urban migration are also illustrated. The material is organized in a circular fashion that is
                    designed to encourage the student to think about himself and his family and thus to motivate him to
                    examine the family's history. Two of the great events of the twentieth
                    century—the Great Depression and World War II—are used as examples to
                    illustrate the way in which world events affect families. After bringing the student through World
                    War II, the authors then swing back to reflecting on modern American life. Here they develop themes
                    of generational tension in manners and morals and the problems involved in adapting to a rapidly
                    changing, highly technological society. Along the margins of the various readings are questions
                    designed to prompt class discussion or student thinking. "Are trial marriages a good idea?
                    Why or why not?" (p. 232). An appendix contains materials and advice to aid students in
                    researching their own family history. The work is well-illustrated and reflects considerable
                    research in a variety of photographic archives.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Generations</hi> is a combination of a mini-history of the Depression, World War II, and
                    postwar America as seen from the perspective of the individual and the family. The problems of the
                    acculturation, racism, poverty, migration, and work are developed not as political issues but as
                    factors with which people have to deal as they "grow up" in modern America and
                    with which their parents struggled during the Depression and World War II. It is an excellent and
                    unique approach to introducing the beginning student to the concepts of family history and recent
                    American history. With a little luck the student will get interested enough in history to take
                    another course.</p>

                    By Daniel B Reibel. (<placeName>

            <p>As Reibel states in his preface, he has tried to "present the means to develop a
                    registration system that will be as good as any and up to the current state of the art" (p.
                    7). He has <pb n="372" id="VAA4025-075-4-077"/> succeeded in doing just that. He presents the
                    various steps and procedures needed to accession objects properly and provides alternative solutions
                    for each step. He correctly recognizes the fact that no museum is exactly like any other museum and
                    that as a consequence registration systems must be tailored to fit individual needs and resources.
                    He also states: "It is more important to be consistent, accurate, and complete than to
                    favor any one system over another" (p. 113).</p>
            <p>Reibel approaches his subject by taking the reader through each step in the registration process;
                    i.e., acquisition, numbering, loans, etc. He presents a variety of means by which these steps can be
                    approached and gives examples and conditions under which, in his experience, each approach works
                    best.</p>
            <p>The book reads well and is uncluttered by professional jargon. Certain terms which may cause
                    confusion, such as accession, catalog, museum, are defined in the first chapter and give the reader
                    a clear idea of how these terms are used in the museum field today. Anyone involved in either
                    starting a museum or working in an established one will find this an essential volume to add to
                    their library. The clear and concise presentation of the subject matter by someone who has had much
                    experience makes this a most useful book. Although the literature on small museums is not
                    particularly large, that which is available is of high quality, and this latest addition to the
                    field fills the long-neglected gap concerning small museum registration methods.</p>
