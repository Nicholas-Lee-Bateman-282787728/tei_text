            <p>The four years of the Civil War provided unprecedented opportunities for Indiana women to expand
                    their traditional domestic roles. As men rushed to volunteer as soldiers following the surrender of
                    Fort Sumter, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in April, 1861, women devised ways both to help the war cause and to survive
                    financially. Carrying their domestic skills into the public forum, they organized soldiers'
                    aid societies to make clothing and collect supplies that they then shipped to state supply offices
                    or took to soldiers in southern camps. They conducted bazaars and organized benefits to raise funds.
                    They helped needy families of soldiers by supplying them with food and winter fuel. Often, out of
                    financial necessity, they carried on family businesses, or they took jobs that had previously been
                    largely reserved for men.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

            <p>Confronted with reports of widespread disease in military hospitals and camps and of neglect and
                    chaos following battles, Indiana women also looked for ways to help the stricken soldiers. Many were
                    inspired by Florence Nightingale, the British woman who <list type="footnotes">

                    Crimean War only six years earlier. Some women, especially those who had worked for women's
                    rights during the previous decades, saw the Civil War as a moral crusade, at once the climax of a
                    long struggle to end slavery and a chance for women to prove themselves capable and equal in a
                    man's world. Others saw nursing opportunities as a badly needed source of income. For a
                    mixture of reasons, then, Hoosier women left their homes to try to serve in hospitals and camps.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

            <p>As hope for a quick solution to the war disappeared and as Governor Oliver P. Morton's role
                    in helping Indiana soldiers became more sharply defined, Indiana women found themselves in a unique
                    position. The Indiana governor's determination to care for his state's soldiers

                    in March, 1862. In January, 1863, Morton and his sanitary commission began to appeal to women to
                    work as nurses in military hospitals and on hospital ships sent south to care for Indiana soldiers.
                    More than any other state agency the Indiana Sanitary Commission encouraged women to take on the

            <p>Paradoxically, in spite of Indiana women nurses' experiences on the battlefield, their
                    endorsement by state authorities, and their increased public visibility, historians largely excluded
                    them from published accounts of the conflict. In the nineteenth century Catharine Merrill's

            <p>For a war that was fought by over two-and-one-half million citizen soldiers for over four years, even
                    to suggest the number of Indiana women who served as paid and volunteer nurses is folly. In his
                    final report to Morton in 1866 William Hannaman, president of the Indiana Sanitary Commission,
                    reported that his agency sent "about two hundred and fifty" women into service as
                    volunteer nurses between 1863 and 1865.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> Before and after the state's
                    efforts to recruit and assign women nurses, however, Indiana women, like thousands of other American
                    women, followed independent routes to nursing experiences. As early as the spring of 1861 when
                    regiments were first organized, women accompanied soldiers to help with practical everyday chores
                    such as laundry and supply keeping and to serve as nurses when needed. Women of all ages wanted to
                    look after "dear relations and friends" in specific regiments. Wives accompanied
                    officer husbands, surgeons, and privates alike. Women worked as nurses at Camp Morton, first a
                    training camp for Indiana volunteers and then a prison for Confederate soldiers on the site of the
                    state fairgrounds at <placeName>

            <p>While some women found it difficult to serve as nurses, women relatives of stricken soldiers were
                    readily granted passes to travel to southern hospitals and camps as temporary nurses. Morton
                    encouraged families to care for their soldier relatives and, at least in the early years of the war,
                    to bring them home to recover. The widespread chaos and medical neglect resulting from the war
                    minimized not only the social taboos that discouraged women from traveling alone but also the real
                    risks of entering a war zone. Women such as Ellen Cathcart, who was a teacher in Catharine

            </p>
            <p>Women who tried to comply with Dix's order to work as nurses only in military hospitals
                    discovered that the process of finding a position was confusing and often unproductive. While they
                    knew that staffs of efficient eastern military hospitals included women nurses, they learned that
                    nursing positions in the West were hard to come by. If they wrote to Dix in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>

                    </placeName>. Provided that the applicant met certain criteria, the sanitary commissions'
                    agents issued the woman a nursing certificate. A nursing assignment, however, was available only if
                    a hospital physician requested women nurses. If, however, potential nurses wrote to Morton to ask
                    his advice, he and his agents recommended that they apply directly to the supervising physician at
                    the desired hospital.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>

                    them letters of recommendation from their local soldiers' aid society, from their pastor,
                    and, if possible, from a physician acquainted with their skills as home nurses.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>

                    follow the military custom of using convalescent soldiers as nurses. In the hospitals that she
                    visited in the winter of 1862, Mary A. Liver-more, a leader of the <placeName>

                    </placeName>-based Northwest Sanitary Commission, found that "the greatest
                    prejudice" was "against Protestant women nurses." If medical authorities
                    allowed any women nurses at all, they preferred Catholic sisters, although the nuns, too, were
                    sometimes shunned. As historian Ann Douglas Wood has pointed out, women nurses often had to fight
                    their own war within a war with male medical and military authorities.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> Still,
                    a small number of Indiana women gained entry to military hospitals. Tested by the hardships and
                    horrors of war, they convinced medical authorities of the invaluable role that women could play.</p>

                    Colfax applied to James Yeatman, president of the Western Sanitary Commission, in October, 1861, and

                    the thousands of soldiers wounded at the battle of Fort Donelson and suffering from diseases brought
                    on from overexposure. In the spring of 1862 she went out on hospital steamships sent by the Western

            <p>Another young Indiana widow who was certified by the Western Sanitary Commission in the early months
                    of the war and who gained wide acceptance was Lois Dennett, also from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Michigan City</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In November, 1861, at the age of thirty-two she joined her friend Harriet Colfax at
                    the City Hospital in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. During that first winter she shared responsibilities with Colfax for caring for as
                    many as three hundred soldiers at a time following the battle of Fort Donelson. In the spring of
                    1862 when military hospitals were first being established in southern Indiana, she wrote Morton
                    asking his help in getting assigned to a hospital "at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> or some other place where nurses are wanted." Although it is not known if the
                    governor influenced her assignment, she was soon placed in charge of an <placeName>

                    nurse" and as a surgical assistant. In addition, she was given five other hospitals to look
                    after, no small responsibility considering the thousands of patients that were brought to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>

                    </placeName> military hospitals, which fact suggests that at least some physicians there supported
                    women nurses. In October, 1862, for example, thirty-eight women served as paid and volunteer nurses
                    in <placeName>

            <p>Although many administrators in military hospitals refused to employ women nurses, Morton in the
                    first months of the war had already begun to depend upon Indiana women to serve as volunteer nurses
                    in state hospitals and in the field. In May, 1861, for example, soon after Indiana's first
                    regiments were organized, the governor asked the Sisters of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Providence</settlement>
                    </placeName> of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">St. Mary-of-the-Woods</settlement>, <region type="county">Vigo County</region>
               </placeName>, to take charge of nursing and practical
                    operations at the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis City</settlement>
                    </placeName> Hospital. Until the last Indiana soldiers were mustered out of the army in July, 1865,
                    the Sisters of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Providence</settlement>
                    </placeName> nursed Union soldiers and Confederate prisoners alike, winning wide respect for their
                    kind, efficient care. In October, 1861, Morton appealed to the Sisters of the Holy Cross, St.
                    Mary's Academy, Notre Dame, to serve as battlefield nurses. Until the end of the war eighty
                    sisters from Notre Dame managed and served in hospitals primarily in Cairo and Mound City, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>

            <p>Although Morton was not the only western governor to establish state offices in major military and
                    hospital centers, send volunteer nurses on hospital ships, or support the services of Catholic
                    sisters in hospitals, he was certainly the most aggressive and the most independent of the war
                    governors. Early in the war frustrations over trying to equip Indiana troops had convinced him of
                    the need to supply Indiana soldiers independently. As he and his agents visited camps and hospitals,
                    impatience over medical incompetence and negligence reinforced his belief that systematically
                    organized medical care should be greatly expanded. A few days after the battle of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Shiloh</settlement>
                    </placeName> in early April, 1862, Morton urged Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton to recruit
                    additional surgeons for field duty. Impatient over Stanton's hesitation and fearing great
                    losses in renewed fighting, Morton telegraphed the secretary of war on April 21 that he intended to
                    send two additional assistant surgeons to care for the twenty-four Indiana regiments anticipating
                    battle at Corinth, <placeName>

                    supplies throughout Indiana and to make distributions to armies in the field. He appointed permanent
                    resident agents in a dozen different hospital and supply centers to look after the many needs of
                    Indiana soldiers. Less than a year later, in January, 1863, Hannaman made it known that among those
                    needs were more women nurses for hospitals swollen with thousands of soldiers from General
                    Sherman's army.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>

            <p>Numerous reports from Morton's agents who were on inspection tours in 1862 not only provided
                    bitter indictments of hospital conditions and medical care but also indicated an underlying
                    disposition toward women nurses. Agents found that both physicians and attendants often exhibited
                    "total want of feeling and sympathy for the condition of the sick." Although
                    adequate supplies had been provided to field hospitals set up after the Battle of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Shiloh</settlement>
                    </placeName>, good nurses were still needed. "Convalescent soldiers" assigned as
                    nurses were, according to the reports, "better qualified to make subjects for hospitals
                    than to nurse them." Another of Morton's agents concluded succinctly,
                    "From what I have already seen I think the sick need better attention."<hi rend="sup">28</hi>

            <p>Beginning in January, 1863, and continuing until the end of the war, the Indiana Sanitary Commission
                    recruited and supported women nurses together with surgeons and agents to look after Indiana
                    soldiers in camps, in hospital centers, and on hospital ships. Some of the volunteer

            <p>When Eliza George first asked for a nursing assignment from the Indiana Sanitary Commission in the
                    early winter of 1863, Hannaman discouraged her because of her age. She was fifty-five years old, an
                    age considered risky for the hardships of war. Besides, Hannaman told her, at the moment there were
                    no assignments available for women nurses. She might, however, apply at the offices of the Northwest
                    Sanitary Commission, in <placeName>

            <p>In February, 1863, only a few weeks after her first interview with Hannaman, George received word

                    she made frequent trips back to Indiana, traveling mountain roads made almost impassable by

            <p>Other Indiana women nurses, however, received little tangible reward for their services. Although

                    qualify for the meager twelve-dollar monthly pension. Except in military hospitals their service had
                    been voluntary. Like the unnamed wife of a 27th Indiana Infantry soldier who had tried to nurse her

                    preparing food, they established well-regulated hospital kitchens that gave soldiers alternatives to
                    the heavy unhealthy food that was standard military fare. Working side by side with physicians after
                    battles, they cleaned and bandaged wounds and challenged unnecessary amputations. <list type="footnotes">

                    1871 stories appeared. His own mother, a granddaughter of the general, had disclaimed knowledge of
                    any such family tradition; and Wilson, an amateur artist, questioned the supposed similarity of the

                            light brown hair and blue eyes, and so powerfully built that he killed several men with his

                    Hughes's point, while cogent, would be irrelevant if Thomas had been an adopted or foster
                    child rather than the natural son of Martha Posey. Neither Hughes nor Fitzpatrick considered a
                    scenario casting Elizabeth Lloyd in the mother's role; and the Huguenot widow Posey, either
                    as the natural or foster mother of Thomas, appears to have disappeared from the script by the time
                    these two eminent commentators addressed the issue in the 1920s.</p>

                    records, however, raises a serious question as to whether John and Martha were the natural parents
                    of Thomas Posey. The captain's earliest recorded presence in Fairfax County was in 1751 (a
                    year after Thomas's birth) when he received his first appointment as processioner of Truro
                    Parish. Martha was the widow of George Harrison, a substantial Fairfax landholder, who died on March
                    21, 1749. As late as June 26, 1750, just two weeks before Thomas was born, she is referred to in
                    court records as "Martha Harrison, widow and relict of George Harrison." The first
                    record confirming her marriage to John Posey is an indenture deed that she witnessed as
                    "Martha Posey" on June 17, 1752, by which instrument the dying Lawrence <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>Who, then, was Thomas Posey's mother? In the absence of any relevant birth, marriage, or
                    death records, her identity can only be surmised. Posey family researcher George Wilson was the
                    first to cast Elizabeth Lloyd in that role. Any evidence of that claim—or, indeed, of her
                    very existence—unfortunately died with Wilson. As was true of the Poseys, there were few,
                    if any, Lloyds in Virginia at this time—certainly none of the prominence stipulated in
                    the Wilson scenario.</p>
            <p>Names given by General Thomas Posey to his own children provide some interesting clues. It was an
                    almost unvarying custom of the time to pass along to newborn children the given names or surnames of
                    cherished family members. Thomas's first son was called John—the namesake, it
                    could be assumed, of Captain John Posey; his second son, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fayette</region>
                    </placeName>, honored his father's revered commander, the marquis, and was an exception to
                    the rule. Thomas and his wife, Mary Alexander Thornton Posey, called their next son
                    Lloyd—a name not previously found anywhere in the Posey/ Harrison families nor in
                    Mary's Alexander/Thornton ancestry. Their first daughter was named Eliza Maria, arguably
                    derivative tributes to Thomas's wife Mary, and his mother, Elizabeth.<hi rend="sup">42</hi>
                    Thomas Posey thus could be said to have held the name Elizabeth Lloyd in high esteem. Did he choose

                    families—as well as that of the unfortunate young mother—the embarrassment
                    arising from George's youthful indiscretion? Such a hypothesis would support either of two
                    possibilities—an arranged, prenatal Posey-Lloyd marriage or a child born out of wedlock,
                    deprived of his mother at or shortly after birth and entrusted to the care and custody of Captain
                    John Posey, possibly around the time of his approaching marriage to the well-regarded and propertied
                    widow, Martha Price Harrison. Either course would have assured the child a good name, a family, and
                    a decent and secure upbringing not far from the watchful eyes of the Washingtons. Such an
                    arrangement, not uncommon in those times, would have preserved the honor and satisfied the duty of
                    all concerned as long as it was never formally recognized or publicly acknowledged. If indeed there
                    was such a pact, it was faithfully observed in all known writings of the Washingtons and the Poseys,
                    including those of Thomas himself in his lifetime and his children thereafter.</p>

                    Yet, in the quarter century of their close relationship, the name of Thomas Posey never once appears
                    in their extended, and often agitated, correspondence. Whether this silence is attributable to some
                    blemish in Thomas's birth—possibly arising from an indiscretion on the part of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> or Captain Posey himself—merely to some random historical happenstance, or
                    to the fact that Thomas was never a member of the John Posey household can only be surmised.</p>
            <p>During Thomas Posey's later military and civilian career, his infrequent exchanges of
                    correspondence with <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> reflect only the formal, arms-length relationship of a revered commander/political
                    leader and a respectful subordinate. Thomas's only recorded visit to <placeName>

                    </placeName> was shortly after he received his commission as brigadier general in 1793, when

            <p>One further point deserves discussion. It is widely believed that <placeName>

                    most unlikely that children would result: "for whilst I retain the reasoning faculties I
                    shall never marry a girl; and it is not probable that I should have children by a woman of an age

                    "youthful indiscretions." Obviously, however, the fifty-four-year-old general, in
                    his twenty-seventh year of a childless marriage, still considered himself capable of fathering
                    children.</p>
            <p>If contemporary accounts are to be believed, there do appear to have been some similarities between

                    </placeName> and Thomas Posey aside from any real or perceived physical resemblance. The characters
                    of both were motivated by an almost obsessive sense of public duty and patriotism. Both were largely
                    self-educated, displayed personal courage and leadership in early military careers, and spent their
                    middle years, after marrying well-to-do widows, as gentlemen planters. Both crowned their
                    life's work with distinguished service in public office. Both died at age sixty-seven from
                    similar causes.</p>
            <p>If Posey really was <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s son, he probably would have known it, as surely as he knew the place and
                    exact date of his birth. Under those assumed circumstances his apparent reticence to identify or
                    otherwise refer to his family in his autobiography or other writings would have been consistent with
                    what is known of his character. Thomas Posey would have been likely to choose silence over
                    dissimulation in a situation in which he felt himself bound by honor or discretion to withhold the
                    facts as he knew them. As General Robert E. Lee later said of him, "the veracity of Posey

                    years brought great personal sadness to the family. Five of the seven Myers sons joined the 43rd

                    out of Indiana. Nelson (1838–1927), for example, was buying land in <placeName>

                    </placeName> as early as February of 1868, and he was married there during the summer of that

                    Although most land had already been cleared or broken, farm buildings and fences had been ruined,
                    and wide areas were simply depopulated. After the Civil War, <placeName>

                    (1852–1943), who married Jacob Harris in the summer of 1869 while her family was
                    preparing to depart, and Mary (1846–1932), who had married John Davis earlier. Of another
                    son, George (1834–1908), much less is known, for no letters to or from him survive
                    although he is occasionally mentioned in the correspondence.</p>
            <p>The Myers family letters were discovered in 1984 in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Newton</settlement>, <country reg="ksu">Kansas</country>
               </placeName>, in a family trunk that
                    had belonged to Mary Myers Davis. They were augmented in the spring of 1986 by copies of other
                    letters in the possession of Mrs. Clella Kelley of Ralston, <placeName>

                    </placeName>, a granddaughter of Margaret Myers Harris. The letters were written back and forth
                    between the Myers parents and their children—all of whom eventually left <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Sullivan County</region>
                    </placeName> for such destinations as <placeName>

                    among the children. The women of the extended family were especially sensitive to the loss of
                    physical proximity, and they were very concerned about staying in touch, however frustrated they
                    were about the limits of the written, as opposed to the spoken, word. Twenty-four years are covered
                    by the letters, by the end of which time the family's dispersal was complete.</p>
            <p>In addition to detailing the mundane activities of late nineteenth-century midwestern farm life, the
                    Myers correspondence records instances of rather poignant domestic drama. Almost half the letters
                    are by women and touch on such classic rural and frontier women's concerns as isolation,
                    illness, excessive work, bereavement, and exasperation with spouses. Margaret, Samuel
                    Myers's wife, was especially plagued with homesickness; a move late in life <list type="footnotes">

                    disturbing to her. Her daughter Maggie, however, spoke out even more bitterly about moving, not
                    realizing how much more of it was to come for her. Indeed, although male dominance is seldom
                    questioned by these women, Maggie in this case professed to have had enough of moving; her husband
                    would have to go by himself next time, she declared. <placeName>

                    </placeName> Myers, Samuel and Margaret's crippled youngest son, is author of a dozen of
                    the letters. Before he died at the age of nineteen, he had little to do but read and write, and he
                    sometimes was an amanuensis for his parents. Some of his letters are gems, the ruefully humorous
                    observations of a shrewd youth matured by adversity. Physically hampered as he was, his mind
                    nevertheless ranged much farther than those of his parents or siblings. Environmental and economic
                    problems impinged on these letter writers. The hard times following the Panic of 1873 and the
                    grasshopper plague the next year, both of which affected Samuel Myers, seem to have been repeated by
                    the drought, crop failure, and depression that drove Charlie Myers out of western Kansas seventeen
                    years later.</p>
            <p>A striking aspect of these letters is their reaffirmation of the tendency of westering families to
                    travel in kinship or friendship groups,<hi rend="sup">8</hi> and frontier mobility is also a general
                    and dominant theme. Jake and Maggie Harris relocated four times during the course of these letters,
                    as did Nelson and Lucy Myers. Charles and Bell Myers moved at least three times. When Samuel Myers
                    went west, he moved with two grown and able-bodied sons, and the letters also suggest that other <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Sullivan County</region>
                    </placeName> residents made the trip to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Vernon County</region>
                    </placeName> at the same time. One of Samuel's daughters and her family were to come on to
                    Missouri from Indiana after Samuel's death. John and Mary Davis migrated to Harvey County, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName>, through a connection with a brother of Jacob Harris, also from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Sullivan County</region>
                    </placeName>, and Charles and Bell Myers seem to have come to the same Kansas area soon after.
                    Indeed these second-generation families were doubly intermarried; Charles and Maggie Myers, brother
                    and sister, were married to Jacob and Isabel Harris, brother and sister. Charles Myers and his
                    family later followed a daughter and her husband to <placeName>

                    in efforts to remain in physical contact by moving together but also by rather frequent visits, much
                    exchanging of gifts—even of orchard produce—and correspondence among family
                    members even into the third generation. Though separated by great distance, Samuel Myers's
                    grandchildren were writing to one another very early.</p>

            <p>The Myers correspondence contains little in the way of speculation or self-examination on the part of
                    the writers; the letters, in fact, seldom rise above the level of narrative. Rather infrequently is
                    even an opinion ventured. Family health, making a living, and nurturing children were dominant
                    considerations in these Hoosier migrants' lives. Not even spiritual concerns seem to have
                    been terribly important to them. For instance, even as the cancer that was to kill him advanced and
                    as the pain became increasingly difficult to bear, Samuel Myers repeatedly evinced a sadly stoic
                    preoccupation with the everyday world rather than with such things as the inevitability of divine
                    rewards and punishments. Churchgoing was obviously of considerable, albeit occasional, significance,
                    especially to Maggie and Florence Harris, but there is much less evidence that religious faith
                    served as an ongoing influence on life. What is perhaps as important as the content of the
                    correspondence, however, is the distinctive and even delightful voice that is common to several of
                    the writers; their letters provide an expression of Hoosier discourse often perfectly conveyed by
                    the writers' phonetic misspellings. Furthermore, most of the letters are utterly
                    uninhibited; their writers seem to take for granted the existence of like-minded readers. A
                    frankness and directness characterize them all.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

                                 <hi rend="sup">1</hi> In order to allow the correspondents to speak for
                                            themselves, the Myers family letters that follow have been minimally edited.
                                            Spelling, grammar, and syntax have been transcribed exactly as written.
                                            Although an attempt was made to determine the punctuation intended by each
                                            writer, it was virtually impossible to distinguish among commas, periods,
                                            pen rests, and blots. In addition, various family members used seemingly
                                            indiscriminate dashes, ditto marks, and lines of dots both within and at the
                                            end of sentences. Frequently there was no punctuation at all. In order to
                                            facilitate reading and avoid confusion, double spaces have been inserted at
                                            what seemed appropriate places throughout the letters whether or not any
                                            kind of punctuation appeared, and incomprehensible commas, equal signs,
                                            ditto marks, etc., have for the most part been ignored. Decisions concerning
                                            capitalization were also at times necessarily arbitrary, as were decisions
                                            regarding "i's" and
                                            "e's," "o's,"
                                            "u's," and "a's."
                                            Spacing of headings, salutations, and closings and of paragraphs has been
                                            standardized. Obviously unintentional repetitions have been omitted. A
                                            three- or four-dot ellipsis indicates omission of a few words or sentences;
                                            a line of dots indicates omission of one or more paragraphs. What few
                                            lengthy omissions there are have been of seemingly marginal material.
                                            Information crowded in at the top or sides of the letters has usually been
                                            inserted as a postscript. Illegible words or phrases have been so indicated
                                            in brackets, and questionable transcriptions are followed by a bracketed
                                            question mark. An attempt has been made to identify all family
                                            members—and as many other individuals as possible—to
                                            whom there is reference in the letters. Birth and death dates were taken
                                            from family Bibles and cemetery records or inferred from federal census
                                            manuscript records.</item>

                                    for it has been So long. Well Mary you was right about Barney when you Said he was
                                    goin to Marry Clem, but I never bleaved it till I Saw Clem, we have a joke on him.
                                    he has been Saying that Clem, had taken him to raise, till it is reported all around
                                    that Clem is old enough to be Barney's Mother, and it plagues him like ever

                                    only because I did not wish to tell you that my lip was no better and part of the
                                    time I have been so tormented with pain both day and night that I could not write I
                                    hope and beleave you will forgive me. Your Mother has had a little Bilous spell was

                        <p>I must say somthing more inreguard to my Cancer. It is more painfull then when I was
                                    at your house the open sore is about the size of a silver dime and about half way
                                    between the Corner of my mouth and the edge of my Chin the sore is not deep but
                                    inflames the inside of my lip so that it gives me trouble about eating or talking
                                    the lump under my Jaw that has increased in size it is about as large as a hens egg
                                    is not sore to the tech but the shooting pains from my lip to my ear goes through
                                    the lump and gives me a great eal of suffering meny nights I dont sleep an hour on
                                    acount of the terable pains. I am still able to go abut and do some work. I have

                        <p>I concluded this morning that I must write you a letter and tell you my true
                                    condition of the cancer I am suffering under The famley are all injoying good helth

                                    could see one another oftener but it cant be helped now we Still have plenty of

                        <p>Now for a plain statement of the cancer. It is no better but wors I had a Dr.
                                    Edmontson from the North part of the state a reglor cancer Dr. come to see me about
                                    three weeks ago, and he gave me but little incouriagement considered it incuriable
                                    and would not take the case I then got Dr. Thornton of Texas a speshel cancer Dr.
                                    has been in the practice for 35 years he examened it very earful and pronounced it a
                                    hopless case but gave me advice to quit Doctern except simple saves and use blood
                                    purifying medison and to take good care of myself but not to spend money in trying
                                    to have it cured that only made it wors and would shorten my days. The cancer on the
                                    lip and chin he said he could cure but it would only make the case wors the tumor
                                    under my jaw was the great trouble it was so closeley attached to the large blood
                                    vessle of the neck that in attempting to take the tumor out there was great danger
                                    in opening the artre and then deth would be the consequence, both of the Drs are
                                    opposed to using the knife or costicks they use remadays that give but little pain I
                                    must stop on this subject</p>
                        <p>The Tumor on my jaw is not a runing sore as that is on my chin or lip but still it is
                                    very painful I have a hard time to git any <pb n="86" id="VAA4025-086-1-092"/> sleep

                        <p>By the request of your Father it is my painful duty to answer your letter which he
                                    received yesterday and tell you of the sad condition he is in he has been confined
                                    to his room for the last two weeks and to the bed the greater part of the time. that
                                    place that was growing on his Jaw when he was in Indiana kept growing till last week
                                    it broke. and now his neck and throat is swelled so bad and so sore that he can
                                    hardly swallow any thing at all he has two regular Cancer Doctors to visit him
                                    recently and both told him they could do nothing for him. one of them was here and
                                    staid all night with him one night this week, he wants you and Charlie to come see
                                    him if you can. he knows of course Mag cant come.<hi rend="sup">23</hi> and I think
                                    you will have to come soon if you get to see him. Charlie promised when he was there
                                    to come this fall, and since he has been so bad he talks about him all the time.
                                    tell him to come if he can by all means the rest of us are well but your Mother is
                                    nearly worn out. our baby is a big fat boy and a great deal of trouble he is not
                                    very cross but we have all talked to him so much we have spoiled him so he dont want
                                    to be alone any as I have filled my paper will have to stop writing with the hope of
                                    seeing or hearing from you soon I would like to see Mags an Sue's babies so
                                    well. if you cant come write as soon as you get this please excuse bad writing and

                        <p>Your letter of th 18 was received yesterday and we also got one from Mag Just a week
                                    before we were glad to hear from you both. and to hear you were all well. Pa is
                                    apparently about the same that he has been for some time. some days he feels better
                                    than he does others. but he is really no better at any time. he still has chills
                                    about the same way he did when Charlie was here. he had not had one for two or three
                                    days until today. he had one.<hi rend="sup">24</hi>

                                    Diptheria and Scarlet fever are raging here among the children we are keeping the

                        <p>Your Mother received your letter last friday. and wishes me to answer for her. and
                                    suppose I must try to do so. We are all as well as usual I believe and are having
                                    very warm nice weather with the exception of an (occasional rain) which makes a
                                    little mud but that soon dries up here. The Peach trees will be in bloom in a few
                                    days if it stays warm. but I think it is entirely too early and fear we will not
                                    have any peaches this year. Your Mother is getting along with the business very
                                    well. thinks she will get it settled up without any trouble. she made a sale of the
                                    property about three weeks ago. some thing brought all they were really worth while

                                    but the roads were getting better then and thought they would have no more trouble.

                                    to hear that you had joined Church. I rec'd a letter from Sue before we got
                                    yours. telling me about it. I hope you will all be benefited by it. We have had
                                    protracted meetings all us this winter but I have not attended any for I dont get
                                    out any place. I find but very little to go and if I had the time Barnes's
                                    horses are so wild that I am afraid of them. and it is too far for me to walk even
                                    to a neighbors. The Babtists are holding forth in Town now. your mother was down
                                    last week and staid three days &amp; nights attending and visiting the members.
                                    Tell Chrlie that our boy is almost as large as he is. has four teeth and is
                                    beginning to try to talk I expect he can make as much noise as he can. and sits at
                                    the table in his high chair as large as you please John if there has been any maple
                                    sugar made there this spring we would like to get 100 lbs if it can be bought
                                    reasonable. we dont want to pay more than 10 cts per pound, and if you could get for
                                    less please do so. but will pay that much. Barnes says if you havnt the money to
                                    spare just now to pay for it. to please write soon and he will send it. and if you
                                    buy and send it right away he will pay all expense when it comes. if you get it you
                                    can go to Jane's and get the trunk I left there and if it has been
                                    destroyed tell Jim he must furnish a box. Charlie promised to get it and send it.
                                    But as his Mother got a letter from him the other day and he said nothing about it
                                    we are afraid he has forgotten it. With love to all I must stop writing for this
                                    time. Excuse all mistakes and bad writing for I am entirely out of practice. Write

                                    been some time since I received it. and I have been trying to answer ever since but
                                    just as sure as I would get ready to write some one would come. or something happen
                                    to prevent me. so I think I will try it tonight by lamp light</p>

                        <p>Barnes and his Mother are neither one very well but are able to go round and I have
                                    the (blues) a little occasionally it does nothing but rain here all the time and the
                                    prospect for corn is decidedly very poor Barnes planted his first about the fist of
                                    last month and it commenced raining and did not stop more than two days at a time
                                    for four weeks the consequence was it did not come up. and as soon he could get in
                                    with the planter he planted all over. it is just now coming up. and will not be
                                    anything extra of a stand, but he is not going to plant any more think perhaps if it
                                    ever gets dry enough for him to plow it make something. some few of the farmers got
                                    planting done very early and have got it plowed over and it is looking fine. and
                                    there are others that have not planted any yet. and some have planted as often as
                                    three times before they had it to come up</p>
                        <p>the wheat is all getting ripe and they cant get in it with machines. Barnes bought a
                                    Cradle yesterday and commenced on his. and thought that he could get in by tomorrow
                                    with the harvester if it did not rain any more, but it is pouring down now. I think
                                    it has set in for a steady nights rain the crop here is generally pretty good if it
                                    can only be taken care of</p>
                        <p>We received a letter from Nels last week he says his corn looks fine and he has forty
                                    Acres of wheat that will make 25 bushels per Acre</p>
                        <p>We had a terrible wind storm here last thursday week. but it did not do any very

                                    broke down a great many trees in the yard and orchard and all the fence on the place
                                    Just the week before we had one that struck a house about a mile and a half from
                                    here and unroofed it lifted of the foundation and blew nearly every thing out of it</p>

                                    words real plain can climb up by chair and stand alone he is considered a very

                        <salute>Dear Sue</salute>
                        <p>It at last falls on me to write you and tell you of our sad loss. that we have lost
                                    our darling little treasure, our precious little boy. he died of Flux th 12 last
                                    Saturday week at Eleven Oclock went to sleep while playing on tuesday night
                                    before[,] apparently as well as he ever was. and was taken during the night we had
                                    the best Medical assistance in <placeName>
                                        <country reg="nvu">Nevada</country>
                                    </placeName> called at first. and we gave him the best attention, never left him a
                                    minute. his Grandma helped us so much she loved him so well and thought he was so
                                    smart. but it just seemed that he must go every thing worked gainst him from the
                                    first. medicine would not have any effect on him and he just grew worse all the
                                    time. The few days of his sickness poor little fellow suffered every thing and he
                                    bore it with so much patience. took his medicine just as nice as any grown person he
                                    was perfectly <pb n="93" id="VAA4025-086-1-099"/> conscious until a few minutes
                                    before he drew his last breath tried to tell me some thing but was to near gone for
                                    me to understand him. Sue I dont think I can ever get over this blow. but know you
                                    can surly sympathize with me if any one can. he was so much company for me. we miss
                                    him when we go to bed and when we get up in the morning at the table and every place
                                    he could say every thing and knew everything was always with me trying to help me
                                    work only when he was asleep I cannot Give him up yet I some times imagine he will
                                    yet come back to us again. and when I think it all over and know that he is gone
                                    from us forever I think I am the most miserable being on earth. I have good
                                    neighbors &amp; friends here that have done all the could for me but all they
                                    can do or say cannot make me feel any better</p>
                        <p>Sue I did not think when I heard of little Jennie's and Charlie's
                                    death last spring I would so soon be called upon to give up my little pet. I know I
                                    should have written to you then and thought about it a great many times, but did not
                                    think I could say anything that would be any consolation to you. but I know your
                                    fellings now. but hope you are felling a little better by this time. perhaps the
                                    little Dears are better of but I cant think so now one thing that grieves me so much
                                    is because we never had Jimmies picture taken. we spent a half day over trying to
                                    get it but we couldnt get him still long enough. and after that Barnes horses got so
                                    wild that I was afraid to ride with them and just for that reason we never got it.
                                    Mother just got a letter from Mary last friday and she wrote for his picture. but we
                                    have nothing but a little of his hair</p>
                        <p>Mary &amp; Mag will no doubt think very shortly that we have not written to them
                                    yet. but I did not feel as though I could write to any one unless it was you. and
                                    knew we ought to write to some of you we expected to send some papers to you with
                                    the Aubituary in last week it was written and taken to the Office but by some means
                                    it was misplaced and do not know whether we will get it this week or not please send
                                    word to the girls as soon as you can Mother has got the sick head ache today I was
                                    not able to be up half the time last week had to keep a girl and am not much better
                                    yet but as we have but little to do am trying to do alone it seems if I did not try
                                    to work alittle I would go crazy though it is very little that I do dont feel as
                                    though I will ever have any energy again please excuse all mistakes I do not know
                                    whether you can read it at all or not Now Sue I think you ought to be sure and
                                    answer this just as soon as you get it shall look for it at [illegible] will send
                                    you a piece of Jimmies little dress he was buried in so Florence and Hadie can see

            <p>Numerous scholarly and creative works have analyzed and celebrated the impact of America's
                    first jazz age, which began after World War I. In <hi rend="i">The Classic Hoagy Carmichael</hi>
                    John Edward Hasse, curator of American music at the Smithsonian Institution, presents a unique
                    version of that decade and its long-term influence via one musical career. A collaboration between
                    the Indiana Historical Society and the Smithsonian, this collection is an impressive tribute to
                    Hoagy Carmichael; it also makes a valuable contribution to the history of American popular music.</p>
            <p>Hoagland Howard Carmichael was born in 1899 and came of age during the important social and cultural
                    changes that shaped modern American life before and immediately after World War I. According to
                    Carmichael in his 1965 autobiography, <hi rend="i">Sometimes I Wonder,</hi> his was a time when
                    "jazz maniacs were being born and I was one of them." Carmichael's
                    earliest musical influences came from his mother's piano performances, including some at
                    Indiana University fraternity parties, and informal instruction from a black pianist, Reginald
                    Duvall, whom Carmichael met in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In the 1920s Carmichael participated as a performer and composer in the early
                    college-based jazz network that developed in Indiana and adjoining midwestern states. Cornetist Leon
                    "Bix" Biederbecke had a profound influence on Carmichael during these formative
                    years. Carmichael practiced his trade in <placeName>

                    </placeName> and, after 1936, in <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Hasse correctly describes this project as a "sonic portrait of one of America's
                    foremost creators of songs" (p. 21). The well-illustrated album set contains fifty-seven
                    musical selections and a sixty-three-page booklet that provides a chronological overview of
                    Carmichael's life and musical career including brief evaluations of his skills as a
                    composer, lyricist, and performer. Careful attention is paid to historical context.</p>
            <p>The musical selections provide the central historical record. Beginning with a 1927 version of
                    "Riverboat Shuffle" by Frankie Trumbauer and his orchestra, the albums proceed
                    through seventy years of Carmichael's music. As Hasse notes, these songs "tell a
                    tale about Carmichael's active and eclectic life and the lives his <pb n="95" id="VAA4025-086-1-101"/>

                    thirty individual singers, bands, or orchestras, listeners benefit from a versatile set of
                    interpretations that range from those of Paul Whiteman and Kate Smith to Louis Armstrong and Wynton
                    Marsalis. Carmichael himself is featured on nine cuts, which the producers use to document the
                    musician's developing vocal and compositional talents. Included are two versions each of
                    Carmichael's best-known hits, "Lazy River," "<placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName> on My Mind," "The Nearness of You,"
                    "Rockin" Chair," and "Skylark," as well as six versions
                    of his immortal "Stardust." Hasse provides an informative additional discography,
                    bibliography, and filmography as references for further study.</p>
            <pb n="96" id="VAA4025-086-1-102"/>
            <p>The Hoagy Carmichael collection is an excellent testimony to what jazz historian Ted Gioia calls the
                    "symbiotic relationship" between American popular song and jazz music. As these
                    albums demonstrate, Carmichael's most accomplished work took place at the sometimes elusive
                    boundary between these two musical areas. Interestingly, Carmichael's ear for this protean
                    material developed because of his appreciation of American vernacular music, including ragtime,
                    spirituals, and circus tunes. As Carmichael stated in his autobiography, he was pleased that he had
                    written tunes that sounded like "folksongs" because they "could be sung
                    all the way through by drunken quartets or by blondes over a piano bar." Hasse notes that
                    Carmichael demonstrated this talent for attracting a wide audience not only with nostalgic songs
                    like "Lazy River" and "<placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName> on My Mind" but also with the piano standard, "Heart and
                    Soul," which generations of children continue to play as though it had come from an
                    anonymous folk tradition (p. 15). Some American song traditions come laden with potentially
                    offensive racial and ethnic stereotypes, of course, and Carmichael found that he needed to change
                    certain "controversial" lyrics in songs like "<placeName>
                        <country reg="-hk">Hong Kong</country>
                    </placeName> Blues" (p. 37). One wishes that Hasse had commented more on what Carmichael
                    found distinctive about African-American and other musical traditions.</p>
            <p>Carmichael's career also embodied the commercial congruence between jazz influences and pop
                    music. The diversity of performers and performance styles in these recordings effectively document
                    the wide range of musical possibilities for compositions like Carmichael's. Indeed, Hasse
                    writes that Carmichael "blazed a trail as one of the first singer-songwriters in the age of
                    mass media" (p. 13). His abilities developed with the emerging phonograph recording, radio,
                    and film industries. He listened to race records as a youngster and wrote music for Hollywood films
                    as an adult. His music illustrates the important role that visual as well as aural music played in
                    the dissemination of jazz.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the most telling event from Carmichael's Hollywood tenure came when he played a
                    pianist named "Smoke" in the 1950 cinema tribute to his hero Bix Beiderbecke. The
                    film gave Carmichael an opportunity to celebrate the dawn of a new musical era and his personal role
                    in creating it. Jazz age history has frequently been distorted by nostalgic portrayals of flappers,
                    sheiks, and jazz hounds; but as <hi rend="i">The Classic Hoagy Carmichael</hi> aptly demonstrates,
                    there were thoughtful young white men and women who embraced jazz as a language for communicating
                    new values and ideas. Carmichael was one of them, and his love for early jazz launched him on a
                    career in popular music that symbolized many of the best creative possibilities of those jazz
                    influences that entered the mainstream of American popular music.</p>

            <p>Between 1836 and 1851 William A. Lindsay recorded in four journals what he described as
                    "some of the most important cases of surgery which have occurred in my practice"
                    (p. 1). Trained in medicine by apprenticeship in <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>, during the years when he made most of the journal entries. Three of his journals are
                    now preserved in the Indiana State Library, and their text forms the core of this book. Katherine
                    Mandusic McDonell has skillfully edited these casebooks to make them accessible to the reader
                    unfamiliar with nineteenth-century medicine. An introduction ably sketches the medical world in
                    which Lindsay functioned, and glossaries identify proper names and medical terms that appear in his
                    text. Over fifty figures, including illustrations of nineteenth-century surgical techniques and
                    photographs of surgical instruments, vividly convey the realities of the surgeon's craft.</p>
            <p>What emerges is a powerful depiction of surgery in nineteenth-century Indiana. In the era before
                    1846, when surgical anesthesia was first used, major surgery was a grisly affair. For example, the
                    dilemma that faced the sick—to bear the disease or submit to the sure agony of undergoing
                    surgery fully sentient—is sharply displayed by the man who suffered from hydrocele for
                    several years before seeking surgical relief from Lindsay, and then only after his scrotum had been
                    distended to twenty inches in length. Lindsay's relationship with the sufferers compelled
                    to seek his aid is one persistent motif in these case histories. Equally intriguing are
                    Lindsay's interactions with other medical practitioners: the orthodox physicians who called
                    on him to manage difficult cases, those he invited for consultation, and the unorthodox healers
                    Lindsay sometimes blamed for aggravating his patients' ills and denounced as quacks.</p>
            <p>The recent impulse to rewrite history from below has drawn the attention of medical historians to the
                    fact that while much is known about the ideas of elite physicians, little is understood about the
                    activities of ordinary practitioners. Lindsay was ordinary but recorded only extraordinary surgical
                    cases. Moreover, he recorded most of these operations years or as much as a decade after performing
                    them, which makes one wish the editor had addressed the question of why Lindsay kept the journals in
                    the first place. Lindsay's casebooks do not reveal the workaday and monotonous drudgery of
                    the nineteenth-century general practitioner; however, this welcome volume does provide a revealing
                    window into <pb n="[98]" id="VAA4025-086-1-104"/>

            <p>James Maynard Shanklin was not a typical soldier. He was the college-educated son of a wealthy <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> merchant and was connected by marriage and other ties to many of the elite families of
                    his city. Before the Civil War he was a lawyer and Democratic politician. With the firing on Fort
                    Sumter, Shanklin immediately rallied to the Union cause and became a War Democrat. He was quickly
                    given the rank of major and was assigned the task of recruiting men for the 42nd Indiana regiment.
                    After nearly two years of exemplary duty in the field, Shanklin was captured and sent to Libby
                    Prison in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
               </placeName>. In May, 1863, shortly after he was exchanged and returned to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, he died suddenly of an unexplained seizure.</p>
            <p>"<hi rend="i">Dearest Lizzie</hi>" consists mainly of letters written by Shanklin
                    and his wife, Lizzie, to each other during his absence in the service. Kenneth P. McCutchan uses
                    prewar letters, newspaper items, and other sources for a first chapter that discusses
                    Shanklin's life before the war and for a concluding chapter that describes the postwar
                    fates of Lizzie and other individuals prominent in the correspondence. McCutchan identifies in
                    footnotes the numerous individuals mentioned in the correspondence and includes in the text extracts
                    from the <hi rend="i">Official Records</hi> and other sources to explain military matters alluded to
                    in the letters. The editor chose neither to analyze the content of the letters nor to place them
                    within the context of the interpretations of Civil War soldiers' motivations and
                    experiences presented in the work of Bell I. Wiley and, more recently, Gerald F. Linderman and Reid <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mitchell</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>While much in the letters is repetitive and mundane, there are also a number of interesting items and
                    illustrations of broad cultural trends. Shanklin provides informative vignettes of the reality of
                    battle, of southern whites and blacks, and of his capture and imprisonment. His letters depict a
                    pious, lay Christian who sought to understand his and the nation's experience of war in
                    terms of civic religious concepts. They also reveal a man whose attitudes, <pb n="100" id="VAA4025-086-1-106"/> beliefs, and behavior were representative of what Daniel W. Howe has
                    defined as Victorian culture. Despite his role in the Democratic party before the war, Shanklin
                    seems to have shared few of the views of the average Hoosier Democrat. He was, culturally speaking,
                    very similar to a typical upper-middle-class Republican. Given this fact, his quick conversion to
                    the Union cause and the War Democrats is quite logical.</p>
            <p>The Shanklin family papers appear to contain correspondence from Shanklin to family members other
                    than his wife. Including some of these letters might have proved useful to historians since Civil
                    War soldiers tended to reveal and describe different things about themselves and the war when
                    writing to male rather than female relatives or even when writing to brothers rather than fathers.</p>

            <p>Joseph B. Herring's account of the unsung Indian patriot, Kenekuk, presents an unusual
                    Native American success story. From the early 1820s until 1852 the charismatic Prophet, who was
                    preserved for posterity in George Catlin's portrait, guided his Vermillion Kickapoo and
                    Potawatomi followers along a path of coexistence and cooperation. As Herring explains,
                    Kenekuk's people accepted acculturation but not assimilation: "although they lived
                    LIKE whites, they did not live AS whites" (p. 4).</p>
            <p>The details of Kenekuk's youth are unrecorded, but by the 1820s he had been converted from a
                    drunken outcast into an Indian Moses who preached a synthesis of Christianity and Indian
                    nationalism. Evidently influenced by vestiges of Roman Catholic teachings among the Kickapoo, the
                    Prophet adopted a black coat as God's holy garment, combined Christianity's most
                    useful aspects with ancient Kickapoo customs, and designed a prayer stick that his followers could
                    use as a mnemonic device in worship. Fundamental to the Prophet's demands of his followers
                    were obedience and denunciation of sin, especially the sin of alcoholism. Sinners were encouraged
                    not only to confess but also to accept corporal punishment in the form of public whippings. The
                    author proposes that the whippings were "to maintain discipline" and strengthen
                    "tribal unity." So powerful was the appeal of his disciplined religion that
                    Kenekuk's adherents held fast in the face of proselytizing attempts by white missionaries.</p>
            <pb n="101" id="VAA4025-086-1-107"/>
            <p>The tightly knit, moralistic society created by Kenekuk and his followers helped them survive
                    onslaughts by waves of white settlers. Consequently, the Vermillion Kickapoo remained in the Wabash
                    country long after most other tribes had been driven west. By stalling for time to move,
                    manipulating Superintendent of Indian Affairs William Clark, and patronizing other white officials,
                    the Prophet's band held on until Jacksonian pressure for removal and the hysteria of the
                    so-called Black Hawk War raised tempers in Illinois against all Indians. At last forced to move to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName>, Kenekuk's band continued to survive in new villages on the Missouri River.
                    Even after the Prophet's death in 1852, Kenekuk's religion lived on, practiced by
                    the Kickapoos on their small reservation.</p>
            <p>Herring's story is an important corrective to the usual accounts of Indian leaders with
                    predictably unhappy endings. Although this work is more description than analysis, it is an
                    essential contribution to the literature of Native American leadership studies. The author deserves
                    much credit for rescuing Kenekuk from the middens of abandonment and restoring him to a place of
                    honor.</p>

               <hi rend="i">A Community Transplanted</hi> transcends the traditional immigration histories of past
                    decades by offering a detailed inside view of Swedish trans-Atlantic migration and community
                    formation that captures the "totality of the immigrant experience" (p. xiii).
                    Robert C. Ostergren has followed several hundred immigrants from their parish of R$aUttvik to the
                    American frontiers of Isanti County, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>

                        <country reg="sdu">South Dakota</country>
                    </placeName>, between the 1860s and 1910s. He vividly describes conditions within the
                    "sending" and "receiving" communities previous to and
                    immediately following the migrations in order to understand the migrant experience within
                    "contexts that were meaningful to the actual participants" (p. xiii).</p>
            <p>Ostergren focuses on the "chain migration" phenomenon in which individuals seeking
                    new opportunities followed the advice <pb n="102" id="VAA4025-086-1-108"/> and examples of friends
                    and kin who had previously uprooted themselves and traveled to a new land. He specifically examines
                    the impact of "America letters," kinship networks, and economic and environmental
                    factors upon individuals' decisions to leave their homes, and he follows the
                    "migration fever" as it swept from town to town in the Swedish parish.</p>
            <p>Through his skillful mining of diverse sources, including parish registers, property tax and land
                    records, manuscript censuses, and literary accounts, Ostergren immerses the reader in the daily life
                    and culture of Swedish immigrants. His finely crafted prose describes how they attempted to rebuild
                    their traditional society, which revolved around family, village, farm, and church, as a
                    "measure of continuity with the past" (p. 9).</p>
            <p>Ostergren concludes that the migration experience was the "connecting tissue" that
                    bound both sides of the Atlantic together and that the isolation of the midwestern frontier provided
                    an environment in which "the old social fabric remained largely inviolate through at least
                    the lives of the immigrant generation" (p. 327). Yet it was only a partial transplantation
                    of culture, argues Ostergren, "a brief emergence of something that resembled …
                    the organism from which it came" (p. 328). Traditional Swedish life was slowly transformed
                    and redefined through the immigrants' encounters with vast land, growing markets, and
                    American society, an experience similar to the transplanted clusters of Germans, Norwegians, Dutch,
                    and other Europeans in the American Middle West.</p>

               <hi rend="i">A Community Transplanted</hi> is a carefully written, richly illustrated case study of
                    human migration. While depending primarily upon vast statistical data, Ostergren successfully
                    breathes life into his subjects and recaptures an immigrant culture of past times. It is a model
                    study of historical geography, immigration, and community transplantation and should quickly become
                    a standard in the field of migration studies.</p>

                        </placeName>,</hi> D. Jerome Tweton strives to provide a small-town, rural context for the
                    Depression and the New <pb n="103" id="VAA4025-086-1-109"/> Deal. The book is rooted in the devoted
                    efforts of the Otter Tail County Historical Society's "Thirties Project,"
                    which was designed to preserve the local oral history of that turbulent decade. Tweton has
                    skillfully employed these oral history materials to describe and assess the county-level and
                    personal impact of numerous New Deal programs. Most chapters include local statistics and vignettes
                    that are used to examine clusters of programs such as those involving direct relief or aiming at
                    banking reorganization and business recovery. One chapter focuses in greater personal detail on
                    workers for the county's Works Progress Administration Historical Records Survey.
                    Tweton's conclusion is that by "recognizing the legitimacy of grass roots control
                    and responsibility, the New Deal fostered a new sense of democracy and community" (p. 167).</p>
            <p>Many readers will find the book somewhat old-fashioned. Recent studies of communities (such as
                    colonial New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>) and of society "from the bottom up" have utilized theoretical models
                    to analyze the interactions of ethnicity, religion, gender, and social class in historical
                    processes. In contrast, Tweton employs no concepts (not even modernization or Robert
                    Wiebe's decline of "island-communities") to place this county's
                    experience in a larger context. The book begins with a rather prosaic survey of ethnic and religious
                    diversity in Otter Tail County but thereafter fails to use this diversity as a tool for analysis.
                    Except for noting a few rural and urban differences the author treats residents as a single
                    homogeneous mass. Furthermore, because Tweton does not establish an operational definition for
                    "grass-roots control," he has no baseline and no basis for claims that
                        "<hi rend="i">never before</hi> [reviewer's emphasis] had individuals and
                    groups made such a variety of decisions that influenced the course of their separate and collective
                    lives" (p. 167).</p>
            <p>Readers seeking the right mood for <hi rend="i">The New Deal at the Grass Roots</hi> might try a
                    musical celebration of America's democratic ethos like Aaron Copland's

                    not only to enlighten his fellow citizens about the fascinating, complex, and sometimes
                    contradictory history of their state over the last half century but also to provide scholars with a
                    pathbreaking study of an important mid-western state. His book is highly informative; it is also a
                    pleasure to read. Most Americans have some knowledge of the wars fought since 1941, of the civil
                    rights and women's movements, of the shift of population from city to suburb and from
                    downtown to shopping mall, of the change from the neighborhood theater and the radio in the living
                    room to the television in the family room, but Thompson's book provides a much more
                    detailed picture of these occurrences. Thompson notes, for example, that in 1940, 95 percent of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>'s urban homes had hot and cold running water and flush toilets, but only
                    one-fifth of the state's farmhouses had these conveniences; three-quarters of city
                    dwellings had central heating, one-quarter of farmhouses. The pattern of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>'s agricultural economy paralleled that of the
                    country's—greatly increased production from a smaller number of larger farms.
                    During the years 1940–1970 the number of dairy farms declined by half, from 123,000 to
                    64,000, but milk production increased by 46 percent. In the 1970s the average-sized Wisconsin farm
                    occupied an intermediate position, somewhat smaller than the grain farms of <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>, <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
               </placeName>, and Minnesota but somewhat larger than the diversified farms of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, and <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Like other industrial states Wisconsin saw the number of its industrial jobs decline during the years
                    that followed World War II. Thompson offers a number of reasons for this development. Some of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Milwaukee</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s major manufacturing companies built nonunion plants in the Sunbelt. Although
                    the state legislature passed laws in the early 1970s that eliminated an onerous tax on new
                    industrial equipment and plant modernization, businessmen continued to believe that Wisconsin had an
                    unfavorable business climate. Neighboring <placeName>

                    </placeName> during these years as their economy grew at a faster rate. Thompson notes that <placeName>

               <hi rend="i">Peace, Faith, Nation: Mennonites and Amish in Nineteenth-Century America.</hi> By
                    Theron F. Schlabach. (Scottsdale, Pa.: Herald Press, 1988. Pp. 415. Illustrations, notes,
                    bibliography, index. Paperbound, $19.95.)</head>
            <p>This book is the second in a projected four-volume history of the Mennonite experience in America, an
                    undertaking designed to tell the story of this significant family of religious outsiders in America
                    and to provide a subtext of faithful testimony to Mennonite values. Theron F. Schlabach's
                    particular focus is the nineteenth century, a period that witnessed geographical and numerical
                    expansion simultaneously with increasing diversity among Mennonites and Amish in America. The author
                    traces the changing fortunes of the Mennonite tradition from 1790 when its members were concentrated
                    in eastern Pennsylvania to the end of the following century, by which time they had spread across
                    the Midwest, the Great Plains, and <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>. During the generations of westward expansion the members of these churches came into
                    contact with evangelical revivalism, struggled through the Civil War, and accommodated a large
                    influx of "new immigrants." Each of these encounters was a shaping experience.
                    Evangelical Protestantism, for example, challenged patterns of community life and the "way
                    of humility" with its strident individualism and conversionist piety. The Civil War created
                    immense tensions among these peace-loving Christians, some of whom rejected pacifism and took part
                    in the conflict. The arrival of ten thousand or more Russian Mennonites late in the century taxed
                    the generosity of resident groups and contributed to further schisms.</p>
            <p>This book features Mennonite characteristics that were distinctive as well as traits the group shared
                    with the larger culture. Schlabach's discussion of the latter is especially useful because
                    of the time-honored Mennonite witness of "separation from the world." The author
                    has packed his volume with anecdotes and biography, details that might have become bewildering had
                    he not organized the study so clearly along thematic and chronological lines.</p>

            <p>No doubt some within the Mennonite tradition will find in these tales of their religious ancestors
                    confirmation of their own faith. Persons interested in the history of American religions will
                    discover in this account striking parallels to the stories of more mainline religious groups. Those
                    concerned with ethnic studies will find this volume a rich resource, too. Individuals focusing on
                    the history of the Midwest, or even more particularly, on the state of Indiana, will not be
                    disappointed either, for this study contains an extended discussion of the Indiana Mennonite
                    community including, for example, those at Yellow Creek and Berne. Scholars who might wish for a
                    more detached account will have to turn elsewhere: this work stands squarely within the Mennonite
                    historiographical tradition by combining chronicle and testimony.</p>

            <p>In this spirited study Grady McWhiney for the most part looks at non-elite white people in the
                    antebellum South. Yet the subjects of his book, which is the culmination of a project that began
                    fifteen years ago when McWhiney and Forrest McDonald suggested reevaluating the southern herdsman,
                    are not necessarily the impoverished, nonslaveholding whites one would expect to find as the focus
                    of such a study. "Cracker does not signify an economic condition," McWhiney
                    observes. "Rather, it defines a culture" (p. xiv).</p>
            <p>The culture that McWhiney describes will be familiar to students of the Old South. The
                    author's thematic chapters, based heavily on travelers' accounts and other
                    contemporary observations of antebellum social life, detail such matters as hospitality, violence,
                    morals, education, and attitudes toward self-esteem and social progress. The archetypal southerner
                    emerges: hard-drinking, scornful of hard work, partial to life in the sun, and given to expressions
                    of pride, loyalty, and intense localism. This archetype does not, however, have local origins. In
                    McWhiney's view these familiar characteristics must be appreciated—even
                    celebrated as he does in these pages—as part of a Celtic tradition given root throughout
                    the South by the Irish and Scotch-Irish immigrants who settled along the spine of the Appalachians
                    from western Virginia into <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName>. Each chapter follows a similar pattern as McWhiney describes
                    "cracker" ways and then the Celtic ways that resemble them. Like the historical
                    differences between the Celts and their tormentors the English, the differences between the Celtic
                    southerners and the Anglo Yankees "were deep cultural contrarieties between two distinct
                    peoples," who eventually fought an inevitable Civil War (p. 269).</p>
            <p>Because McWhiney sees this Anglo-Celtic conflict as continuous and hardly mediated at all by the
                    American experience, the book is substantially flawed. For all of its engaging, colorful accounts of
                    southern ways and despite the importance of understanding the impact of Irish settlement of the
                    South, McWhiney's study has no discernable interpretation of how a cultural tradition is
                    transmitted from one generation to another. Too often, it appears that McWhiney's Celts are
                    almost genetically driven to reproduce their patterns of herding and hospitality without reference
                    to—or self-consciousness about—changes in the development of a heritage. By
                    proceeding thematically McWhiney is unable to focus on change, on how <hi rend="i">southern</hi>
                    conditions made southerners; thus, he minimizes fundamental realities of southern history in this
                    era. He does not consider, to take one example, the ways in which <pb n="108" id="VAA4025-086-1-114"/> evangelical Christianity, especially among women, served to counterpoint and undercut so many of
                    the male excesses of "cracker" life. He consistently underplays race in all
                    regards, ignoring the ways in which slavery shaped work, leisure, and belief. Moreover, had McWhiney
                    explored the culture of southerners (of Irish and other descent) who settled in southern Indiana,
                    asking how their way of life resembled or departed from the one he sees, he might have been better
                    able to assess the conditions that turned a Celt into a "cracker." But he chooses
                    to stay within the borders of the Old South, carrying on the old war.</p>

                    1701–1840.</hi> By Larry E. Tise. (<placeName>

            <p>In this bold and provocative work Larry E. Tise seeks to "demythologize both popular
                    perceptions of the defense of slavery and the misconceptions innocently perpetuated by
                    historians" (p. xiv). Unlike previous scholars who understood proslavery ideology to be a
                    corpus of prejudice espoused by southern slaveholding racists, Tise interprets it as part of a
                    broader tradition of hierarchical thought, "a nationally held system of symbols and beliefs
                    that, despite all of the appearances of the mood and direction of antebellum America, seems to have
                    won the adherence and endorsement of a vast number of Americans both in the North and in the
                    South" (pp. 360–61). Tise argues that proslavery ideology stemmed from the
                    unique character of the American experience and not from any peculiar qualities of antebellum
                    southern culture. It was, he explains, a value system "that reconciled … the
                    inevitable conflict between the nation's Revolutionary ideals and the facts of
                    enslavement" and a major ideological foundation "for the renovation of American
                    society as a great conservative republic" (p. 361). Employing the methodologies of
                    narrative, quantitative, and comparative history, Tise focuses on the antebellum clergy, a group
                    that authored almost one-half of all the proslavery works that he examined.</p>
            <p>Tise locates the origins of American proslavery thought in eighteenth-century conservative New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, not in the nineteenth-century plantation South. He recognizes the rhetoric of freedom
                    and equality that temporarily swept the new American nation during and immediately following the
                    Revolution but argues persuasively that proslavery thought dominated attitudes toward <pb n="109" id="VAA4025-086-1-115"/> blacks and other alleged "inferior" peoples both
                    before and after the conflict. New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> Federalists and conservative ministers—fearful of the French Revolution and
                    slave revolts in the Caribbean—challenged the natural rights ideology of the American
                    Revolution and of the Jeffersonians. Ironically, it was not until the 1830s that proslavery doctrine
                    penetrated the South, long a stronghold of Jeffersonian ideals, as New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> clergymen transported the proslavery ideology with them below the Mason and Dixon line.
                    Not until then, argues Tise, did the South enter "America's lively conservative
                    counterrevolutionary tradition and thereby into the mainstream of American history" (p.
                    361).</p>
            <p>Tise's innovative and imaginative work revises generations of scholarship on the proslavery
                    argument, especially William S. Jenkins's standard <hi rend="i">Pro-slavery Thought in the
                        Old South</hi> (1935). In addition to illuminating proslavery doctrine in New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, Tise correctly underscores proslavery's "neglected period,"
                    1808–1832, and the proslavery heritage of late eighteenth-century Britain and the West
                    Indies. For all of his insightful analyses, however, Tise fails to explain to what extent white
                    Americans—not just an intellectual elite—shared a dedication to proslavery
                    republicanism. And regrettably, Tise's book is marred by an arrogant, self-righteous,
                    moralistic tone, one that is unsympathetic to the best efforts of previous scholars. Nevertheless,
                    historians of slavery and the South will find <hi rend="i">Proslavery</hi> an engaging and
                    challenging book, one with which they will most certainly have to reckon.</p>

            <p>It is refreshing to read a book that takes the high ground and delineates issues of large
                    significance in Civil War military history, a subfield dominated by minutia. Richard M. McMurry
                    rises above the detail and provides what he calls "a philosophical and historiographical
                    introduction" (p. xiii) to a much larger study that he plans to write about the Confederate
                    war effort in the western theater. This larger study, which will seek to explain why the
                    Confederates lost the Civil War through their magnificent defeats in the West, will cover military
                    operations and "political, economic, strategic, tactical, organizational, administrative,
                    naval, and logistical facets" (p. x).</p>
            <pb n="110" id="VAA4025-086-1-116"/>
            <p>This short work—which is an essay comparing the major rebel army of the West, the Army of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName>, with the major rebel army of the East, the Army of Northern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>—deftly sets the stage for the upcoming book. It spells out in clear
                    language, supported by convincing evidence, McMurry's thesis that the Army of Tennessee had
                    all the cards stacked against it. Geography, industry, transportation, training, administration, and
                    organization all hampered the western army while favoring Robert E. Lee's eastern force.
                    The more competent Federal generals in the West compared to those in the East further upset the
                    balance of opportunity. In McMurry's view there was little chance that the Army of
                    Tennessee could have been successful.</p>
            <p>McMurry's argument is convincing, although one could protest its deterministic tone. If more
                    imaginative and inspirational leaders could have been found for the Army of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName>, surely strategic gains could have been made in the West, as they nearly were during
                    Braxton Bragg's mishandled invasion of Kentucky in the summer of 1862. But of course
                    McMurry deals with facts, not might-have-beens. His major contribution is to show that not only poor
                    generalship but a host of social, cultural, and geographical factors as well led to Confederate
                    defeat in the West. In accurately gauging the relative effect of both theaters of operation on the
                    course of the Confederate war effort, McMurry supports the nascent argument that the West was the
                    decisive theater. It is an interpretation that may upset those whose heart is with Lee's
                    army, but it rings wonderfully true to those specialists who have been weaned on the western
                    battles.</p>

            <p>These two books, one an exhaustively detailed treatment of a single battle, the other a study of the
                    strategic, tactical, and technical influence of an entire war on the evolution of warfare, represent
                    opposite ends of the spectrum of military history. <hi rend="i">If It Takes All Summer</hi> is a
                    study of the two-week-long battle of Spotsylvania <pb n="111" id="VAA4025-086-1-117"/> that occurred
                    May 6–21, 1864. <hi rend="i">The American Civil War and the Origins of Modern
                    Warfare,</hi> on the other hand, is almost a technical manual in its painstaking description of the
                    logistical and technological aspects of the Civil War.</p>
            <p>Although intimate knowledge of each major Civil War battle is not particularly useful to any but the
                    most dedicated buff, a good grasp of the myriad activities involved in all large-scale combat,
                    beyond the fighting itself, is essential to a serious military historian. Spotsylvania lends itself
                    well to this kind of detailed treatment since the struggle encompassed fourteen days of continuous
                    fighting between the two armies. As William D. Matter ably describes, moving, maneuvering, and
                    fighting a large force is a very difficult task that is not adequately treated in more general
                    military histories. He takes the reader down to the regimental level to explore the human elements
                    of combat and to show in microcosm the "fog of battle" that exists at all levels
                    in all battles. When he must move up the chain of command, however, Matter has a tendency to move
                    too quickly from unit to unit and from Union to Confederate forces instead of letting events flow in
                    longer sequences. More and better maps would have helped although the author does have a useful
                    order of battle included as an appendix. If one has the patience and interest to follow the details
                    of the battles and maneuvers, this well-written and fast-paced book provides an excellent account of
                    the bloody affair at Spotsylvania.</p>
            <p>Few authors have probed the Civil War as deeply or as successfully as Edward Hagerman in <hi rend="i">The American Civil War and the Origins of Modern Warfare.</hi> In the area of tactics,
                    strategy, and grand strategy readers learn much about entrenching, frontal assaults versus flanking
                    movements, kinds of strategies, the high command's thinking about grand strategy, and many
                    other issues with which the decision makers groped. The author traces the evolution of weapons and
                    the organization of infantry, cavalry, artillery, and engineers as well as the relationship of these
                    elements to each other. He discusses both the limitations and opportunities presented by railroads,
                    rivers, and roads and examines other transportation factors such as the importance of wagons, mules,
                    and horses to the success of the Union armies and to the eventual breakdown of the Confederate
                    forces. Hagerman also explores topics seldom covered in military history texts. He discusses
                    communications and the struggle to establish a signal corps. He investigates the effect of Union and
                    Confederate soldiers' caloric intake on combat performance. He demonstrates that commanders
                    (or students of military history) ignore logistics at their peril. Again, as in the Spotsylvania
                    book, the reader learns how difficult and complicated it is to fight and to move an army.</p>
            <p>Occasionally, confusion results when Hagerman moves too quickly from topic to topic without

                    sometimes allows the fighting to become the main part of his story. Technological topics rather than
                    battlefield chronology should have dictated the flow of the book; subject matter is what the reader
                    needs to absorb, not the flow of events. Nevertheless, no serious Civil War scholar can do without
                    this invaluable book. Matter's work on the battle of Spotsylvania is excellent, absorbing,
                    and informative, but Hagerman's coverage of the technological aspects of the Civil War is
                    essential.</p>

            <p>Using an impressive array of sources including newspapers, census data, and city directories as well
                    as the private papers of both single and married women representing a wide variety of ages, classes,
                    and ethnic groups, Glenda Riley argues that the lives of pioneer women differed so significantly
                    from those of frontiersmen that it is possible to identify what she calls a "female
                    frontier," a frontier governed by behavior patterns, sensibilities, and a value system that
                    were distinctly feminine. According to Riley, the frontier provided men with an environment that
                    encouraged them to exploit natural resources and participate in public affairs such as military
                    expeditions or politics. The frontier experience for women, however, was dominated by conventional
                    attitudes toward gender roles and the cult of domesticity. Riley points out, for example, that
                    employment for women on the prairie and the plains was typically confined to such traditionally
                    female occupations as teaching, domestic service, needlework, medical care, farm labor, and
                    prostitution. While she admits that opportunities to step outside the bounds of acceptable female
                    behavior patterns existed on both the prairie and the plains, she argues that "pervasive
                    social controls" limited their impact (p. 196). Her evidence also indicates that while
                    conditions on the plains could be more trying to women than those on the prairie, there was little
                    else to differentiate between the lives of frontierswomen in the two regions. She argues that the
                    focus of women's lives in both areas centered around activities such as housekeeping,
                    childbearing, self-improvement, and community service.</p>
            <pb n="113" id="VAA4025-086-1-119"/>
            <p>Riley's assessment of women's experience on the frontier does not differ
                    substantially from much that has been written on the subject since John Mack Faragher's <hi rend="i">Women and Men on the Overland Trail</hi> was published in 1979. In his book Faragher
                    stressed the common culture that men and women shared with each other and carried with them into the
                    frontier. A part of that shared culture was a set of clearly defined ideas concerning
                    women's proper role in society. Riley uses her evidence to illustrate the impact that those
                    ideas had on conduct of everyday life on both the prairie and the plains and concludes that there
                    was little on either frontier to liberate women from them.</p>

            <p>This book is narrower than its title may indicate. Rather than considering nineteenth-century
                    families and farmhouses generally, it focuses on "several hundred" (p. vii) house
                    plans that northern farmers submitted to agricultural journals from 1830 to the end of the
                    nineteenth century. It stops when architects and home economists took control of advanced thinking
                    about rural houses and ended the progressive, vernacular tradition that gave concrete forms to
                    aspiring farmers' ideas about domestic life. Those ideas are the principal subjects of this
                    impressively argued and abundantly illustrated monograph.</p>
            <p>Sally McMurry demonstrates that rural ideas about domesticity differed from the urban and suburban
                    versions that are more familiar to historians. Urban domestic ideology defined homes as sanctuaries;
                    rural domesticity, at least through the mid-nineteenth century, recognized that homes were
                    productive work places. Designs made in light of that recognition put nurseries near kitchens so
                    that mothers could supervise children without much interruption of work. That focus on production
                    weakened later in the century when plans called for assortments of rooms that would satisfy family
                    members' demands for leisure and privacy, but even then rural house planners distinguished
                    themselves from their city counterparts by substituting sitting rooms for parlors. Sitting rooms
                    were supposed to foster economy and unity as opposed to the "family disintegration,
                    economic waste, and idleness" (p. 6) that parlors were thought to epitomize.</p>
            <pb n="114" id="VAA4025-086-1-120"/>
            <p>Other aspects of domesticity that are considered in relationship to house designs include
                    childrearing, the growing differentiation between women's and men's work that
                    accompanied the " `defeminization' of agriculture" (p. 95), and farm
                    women's growing perception of their work as drudgery. McMurry's discussion of
                    drudgery is particularly illuminating; it suggests that women felt increasingly burdened as they
                    withdrew from farm work, as their families prospered, and even as they acquired advanced tools such
                    as sewing machines.</p>
            <p>McMurry's argument about drudgery, like most of the book, rests on the author's
                    penetrating study of the principal nineteenth-century farm journals. As she recognizes, those
                    journals pose a problem; they provide much less information about the "progressive
                    families" (p. 26) that contributed plans and opinions than she would like to have. Apart
                    from a few well-known contributors, such as Lewis Falley Allen, her progressive house designers are
                    shadowy figures. Despite that difficulty, the journals document the ideas of a great many thoughtful
                    farm people as no other sources do. McMurry makes exemplary use of their words and pictures and also
                    draws upon an imposing mass of other primary and secondary sources. Both her analysis and her
                    bibliography will be helpful to students of nineteenth-century rural life.</p>

                    Illustrations, appendixes, select bibliography, index. $24.95.)</head>
            <p>In this volume Wayne D. Rasmussen surveys the history of the Cooperative Extension throughout the
                    entire nation. The book commemorates the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Smith Lever Act, which
                    established the Cooperative Extension Service in 1914. Approaching the subject in both a
                    chronological and topical manner, Rasmussen first presents (following an introductory chapter) four
                    chapters on the historical development of Extension, tracing the organization from the days of
                    farmers' institutes through the end of World War II. He then treats his subject in a
                    topical manner in chapters on the relationship between Extension and the farmer; the home (including
                    health and nutrition); youth and leadership; and rural and community development. He ends with a
                    chapter on the next seventy-five years, discussing problems that Extension may face and making some
                    suggestions for the future. Throughout, he has much praise for the Extension Service and its
                    accomplishments.</p>
            <pb n="115" id="VAA4025-086-1-121"/>
            <p>In his efforts to survey the entire field of Cooperative Extension in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, Rasmussen faces a formidable, perhaps even impossible, task. Although all state
                    Extension Services shared a common structure and relationship with the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Department of Agriculture, regional variations affected the thinking and procedures of
                    local Extension officials. Even the acceptance of Extension by area farmers varied from state to
                    state; in fact, it often varied from township to township within the same county. Although Rasmussen
                    does briefly note many of these differences, many regional and state variations are unavoidably
                    obscured because of his wide perspective.</p>
            <p>Even with this limitation the book manifests the vast knowledge of Extension that Rasmussen has
                    gained over a professional lifetime of working for the USDA. It provides an excellent general
                    overview of the Extension Service throughout the country and a thorough understanding of the way the
                    cooperative relationship worked between the USDA, the state land grant colleges, and the county
                    Extension organizations. The reader only wishes that the book were twice its present length so that
                    Rasmussen might have included more information on the Extension Service after 1945 and more on
                    specific state services, information that he obviously possesses. The volume is well written and
                    provides an informative and a readable account for both the professional and the lay person.</p>

            <p>Michael Bradshaw in his overview of American regionalism contends that a regional perspective would
                    enhance public policy decisions with regard to many issues; however, he believes that there is a
                    problem with identifying the most appropriate set of regions. A British geographer, he argues that
                    the confusion over contemporary regions of America results from "the fact that most
                    regional geographies assume a `snapshot' static view of regional divisions."
                    Instead, he states, "A historical input is required" (p. 27). Bradshaw, however,
                    does not seem to have considered the <pb n="116" id="VAA4025-086-1-122"/> work of two of the leading
                    American regional geographers, D. W. Meinig and Peirce Lewis; and although the name of a third major
                    regionalist, Wilbur Zelinsky, appears in the bibliography, Zelinsky's interpretation is not
                    evident in the text. For example, the mid-twentieth-century American regions depicted on page 49 are
                    urban hinterlands, a functional, not a historical, definition. Perhaps Bradshaw has given short
                    shrift to the literature in historical geography because of its primarily cultural emphasis whereas
                    Bradshaw believes mainly in economic regionalization: "the most important socio-economic
                    differences between regions are those which are based on inequalites which emerge between groups of
                    people and so between the regions in which they live" (p. 60).</p>
            <p>Bradshaw also provides case studies of regions—Frostbelt versus Sunbelt, East versus West,
                    the Tennessee Valley, and Appalachia among others—distinctive with regard to economic
                    base, degree of affluence, and economic problems. Again, cultural distinctions are not considered.
                    One wonders about the usefulness of public policy decisions made by planners with little
                    appreciation of regional culture.</p>
            <p>Michael Steiner and Clarence Mondale have written a very different and much richer book on American
                    regionalism. Their work provides an annotated bibliography of the literature on American regionalism
                    from many disciplines, including anthropology, economics, geography, history, literature, political
                    science, and sociology. The section on geography is divided into "Region as
                    Concept," "Perception Studies," "Landscape and
                    Settlement," and "Distributional Studies." The section on history
                    includes units on "Frontier and Landscape" and "Family and Community
                    Studies." This source book is an indispensable resource for anyone seriously interested in
                    the geographical complexity of American society. It is surprising, however, that Robert S. and Helen
                    M. Lynd's <hi rend="i">

            <p>Tecumseh became a magnet for younger warriors who wished to continue the fight. While the messianic
                    preaching of his brother, the Prophet—a reformed drunkard known as the Open
                    Door—produced a religious movement among the tribes, Tecumseh welded together a
                    remarkable multitribal confederation. Thorn conveys the growing tension between Indians and whites
                    by focusing on the confrontation between the protagonists, Tecumseh and his nemesis, Governor
                    William Henry Harrison of Indiana Territory. Harrison failed to break the confederacy at the Battle
                    of Tippecanoe in 1811, but Tecumseh's death at the Battle of the Thames in 1813 shattered
                    Indian hopes of halting American expansion east of the <placeName>

            <p>Historical novels with their imagined incidents, stilted dialogue, and uncomplicated characters often
                    trivialize rather than breathe life into the stories they attempt to dramatize. This is especially
                    the case when novelists try their hands at Indian subjects. <hi rend="i">Panther in the Sky</hi>
                    shares some of the shortcomings of the genre. There are occasional inaccuracies, and the rather
                    stereotypical portrayal of the Prophet as a deformed buffoon does little to explain his influence.
                    The romantic interest between Tecumseh and Rebecca Galloway is weak because it is fiction not
                    history. The narrative is strongest where the historical record is rich and the author has less need
                    to resort to invention.</p>
            <p>Thorn naturally portrays his hero as larger than life, but Tecumseh was a charismatic leader and a
                    remarkable individual who impressed even his enemies. Historians and ethnologists will find things
                    to criticize here, but this novel finally gives an Indian leader his place in popular literature as
                    a major figure in the history of Indiana and of the <placeName>

                    collection of sixty-two of those photos is true to its title. Johnson's choices exemplify

                    published from 1985 to 1990 is intended as a bibliographic contribution to Indiana's
                    history. We hope to present such a list in each March issue of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of
                        History.</hi> We recognize that the list is neither complete nor systematic in coverage, and we
                    hope that readers will help us by sending items for possible inclusion. We are especially interested
                    in listing publications that make some contribution to understanding Indiana's past but
                    that are not normally reviewed in the IMH. Generally, we will not list newspaper articles or
                    accounts of local historical society activities, but printed pamphlets as well as journal articles
                    may be listed. All such items for the March, 1991, issue must be received by December 1, 1990. Many
                    people have contributed to the present list, but major responsibility has rested with Leigh Darbee
