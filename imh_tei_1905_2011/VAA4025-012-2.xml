            <p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> Socialist Party in Indiana is not something different and apart from the
                    general Socialist movement; on the other hand it is affiliated with and subordinated to the
                    Socialist Party in America. It also cleaves closely to the principles of International Socialism as
                    outlined by the national platforms and decisions of International Congresses. This State has been
                    one of the most regular in its adherence to the national organization. The Unity Convention
                    permitted the various States and Territories much latitude in organizing to suit the needs of the
                    various sections, but there is at present a tendency to bring all the State organizations under the
                    more direct control of the national offices. Indiana will have nothing to undo, as it started right.</p>
            <p>Indiana may justly claim some prestige in the Socialist Party. <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Indiana, was the scene of the most important of the Owenite movements. While this
                    experiment did not have any direct connection with the present political party, it served to show
                    social unrest and sowed some seeds, the fruit of which was harvested by reformers in favor of the
                    emancipation of labor.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Robert Owen was called "Our Dear Social
                    Father" and it is said by Owen's associates that Owen claimed to have used the
                    word "Socialism" at least ten years before it was adopted by any other writer. If
                    he did not actually use the word it came into use as a substitute for Owenite.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

            <p>The Socialist contribution to the picture gallery of party emblems in its present form is the work of
                    James Oneal, of <placeName>

                    </placeName>. The design represents two clasped hands around the globe. Encircling the picture is
                    the famous motto of Karl Marx, "Workers of the World Unite" and the words,
                    "Socialist Party." This badge is used by the national organization and by nearly
                    all of the States.</p>
            <p>The Socialist paper, <hi rend="i">The Appeal to Reason</hi>, was started in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Greensburg</settlement>

                    The place was selected because the editor desired his paper to circulate from the center of
                    population. It was in this paper that Eugene Debs first advocated "the establishment by
                    ballot of a commonwealth based upon co-operation."</p>
            <p>Mr. Debs, the party's candidate for president in four campaigns, was born in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> and still lives in his native city. His brother Theodore was the first national
                    secretary of the Social Democratic party.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and John W. Kelly, of <placeName>

                    Party in America.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The movement was not entirely new, "The Socialist Labor party" had been organized
                    some twenty-five years before;<hi rend="sup">5</hi> and had been the main representative of the
                    Socialist movement during this period though related societies of an educational character were to
                    be found here and there. Its highly centralized form of organization and adherence to a dogmatic
                    censorship over the utterances of its members bred dissention in the early nineties. In 1896 the
                    Socialist Labor Party organized the Socialist Trades and Labor Alliance as an antagonist of the
                    trade union movement. This was an outcome of fruitless efforts to force the trade unions to accept
                    Socialist principles. These two organizations never proved' a success and the
                    dissatisfaction it caused in the ranks of the Socialist Labor Party resulted in a split in the party
                    in July, 1899. The larger part of the membership withdrew and organized with headquarters in <placeName>

                    </placeName>. There were two Socialist Labor Parties with headquarters in the same city.</p>
            <p>On January 1, 1897, Mr. Eugene Debs issued a circular to the members of American Railway Union

                    to the Associated Press announcing his conversion to socialism, saying, "I am for Socialism
                    because I am for humanity."<hi rend="sup">6</hi> It was hoped that this stand taken by
                    their leader would bring the American Railway Union into the folds of Socialism and it did so,
                    practically.</p>
            <p>The Social Democracy of America was organized in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> June 18, 1897. This party was the result of a union between members of the American
                    Railway Union numbering about 150,000, the Brotherhood of the Co-operative Commonwealth, and the
                    independent organizations of Socialists, most of whom had left the Socialist Labor Party. The
                    national executive board was composed of old American Railway Union officers, "The five
                    Woodstock prisoners."<hi rend="sup">7</hi> The organization was somewhat crude and
                    indefinite in its declarations of principles and in its working methods. It provided for a
                    colonization department with the view of capturing some western State and organizing a model
                    Socialist commonwealth as an example for the other States. Mr. Debs and others made tours of the
                    East and South in interest of the new party. The elections of 1898 show gains of this faction over
                    the Socialist Labor Party, electing two aldermen in <placeName>

            <p>The first national convention of the Social Democracy met in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> June 7, 1898. Eugene V. Debs presided. There were present 170 delegates representing 94
                    branches. The issue of political action versus colonization immediately developed. A split followed.
                    The political actionists were in the minority. The advocates of colonization established two small
                    colonies in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> State. They maintained a precarious existence for a few months when Social Democracy
                    disappeared. The thirty-seven political action delegates bolted the convention, reconvened at Hull
                    House and organized a political party, taking the name Social Democratic Party of America, with
                    headquarters in <placeName>

                    upon the membership.</p>
            <p>The convention nominated Eugene V. Debs, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>

                    </placeName> convention of the Social Democratic Party and after an earnest presentation of the need
                    of unity a committee was elected to confer with a like committee from <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The recommendations of the joint conference of three were submitted to both organizations for a
                    general vote of their members. They were rejected by a vote of 1,336 to 720, but this did not
                    prevent both factions from supporting the same presidential ticket. The Socialist Labor Party, in
                    anticipation of unity, adopted the same name as the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> organization and so there were two Social Democratic parties. However, the result of
                    the presidential campaign brought a better understanding between members of both organizations, so
                    that a union convention met in <placeName>

            <p>Besides economic conditions there were other reasons why this was an opportune time for the birth of
                    a new party.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> The Populist Party was in the West, the Greenback in the Middle
                    West and Northwest, and Union Labor in the East. These organizations were casting a quarter of a
                    million votes without electing any of their candidates. The Populist Party in its convention in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Omaha</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1892 tried to catch the votes of the labor unions by its plank which said:
                    "Wealth belongs to him who creates it and every dollar taken from industry without its
                    equivalent is robbery. The interests of rural and civic laborers are the same; their enemies are
                        identical."<hi rend="sup">12</hi> The Populists fused with the Democrats in 1896. Debs
                    supported Bryan in this campaign, but there were many who would not affiliate with the old line

            <p>The party officers and committees up to the adoption of the new constitution April 10, 1914, had been
                    named by the party in State convention and then submitted to the locals for a referendum vote. It
                    was necessary to name at least two persons for each office so there might be a choice, but by the
                    present system the State secretary-treasurer sends out a call on the first Monday in October to the
                    locals for nominations giving a limited time for nominations and acceptances:</p>
            <p>Then within ten days ballots shall be prepared and sent out for the referendum; thirty days to be
                    allowed for the vote; should there be no majority vote for any candidate on the first ballot, then
                    within ten days all names but the two highest shall be dropped; when more than two candidates remain
                    and only one to be elected, and all but three dropped when two are to be elected, and so on allowing
                    of one candidate in excess of the actual number to be elected before a second and final ballot is to
                    be taken. Thirty days shall be allowed for the second ballot.</p>
            <p>The duties of the State party officers are definitely outlined:</p>
            <p>The Chairman shall attend to all political transactions involving the signing of documents, as may be
                    prescribed by State law. He shall attend to the political affairs of the party and supply such
                    information regarding the election laws as may be required by virtue of his office. He shall be a
                    member of the Executive Committee, and he shall have been a member of the party for two consecutive
                    preceding elections.24</p>
            <p>The real business of the party is transacted by the secretary-treasurer. In the beginning of the
                    party the duties of this hyphenated officer were performed by two different members, each serving as
                    a labor of love, but the work was too much for a man to do and carry on his own business. In 1904:</p>
            <p>It was decided that the duties of secretary shall be performed by a regularly employed and paid
                    official who shall devote his entire time to the work and shall receive as compensation a minimum
                    salary of fifty dollars a month or a maximum of eighty at the discretion of the state executive
                        board.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The salary question was later placed in the hands of the State Convention. It has been gradually
                    increased from fifty dollars to sixty in 1911, sixty-five in 1912 and seventy-five since 1912. The
                    office rent and supplies are paid for by the party and the fixtures are owned by the party.</p>

            <p>The office of the secretary-treasurer is the headquarters for the State. It is open the year round
                    and is a regular beehive of activity. A fairly good-sized book store must be conducted besides
                    taking care of the party records. The room is the editorial one for publishing the <hi rend="i">Indiana Socialist Party Bulletin</hi>, copies of <hi rend="i">which are sent to</hi> the locals
                    for distribution among the members so that each one may keep in touch with every move that is made
                    and know how the money is used, for the members "pay the fiddler and call the
                    tunes."</p>
            <p>Closely connected with the work of the secretary-treasurer is that of the executive committee,
                    composed of the chairman and four other members:</p>
            <p>The state organization shall pay all necessary expenses of members of the Executive Committee and
                    allow them two dollars per day during time of actual service. They shall meet every four months or
                    oftener if necessary between meetings, the business of the party to be carried on by
                        correspondences?<hi rend="sup">27</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This committee has concurrent powers in connection with the secretary-treasurer in transacting all
                    business that is not expressly delegated to the State secretary-treasurer or the vote of the party.
                    It has original jurisdiction in the care of all legal possessions of the party in Indiana, also in
                    the hearing and revoking of any charter of any subdivision which is accused of violating party
                    principles.</p>
            <p>Another very important party officer in the State organization is the Woman's State

                    co-ordinate with State secretary but does not define the duties, while the constitutions of 1912 and
                    1913 define the duties but do not classify the position. Her duties are to keep in touch with women
                    correspondents elected by the locals and with the State secretary-treasurer, who is to co-operate

                    suffragist Socialists.</p>
            <p>The first woman correspondent, Rosa Lehnert, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> in her report to the State convention in 1912 made some unexpected recommendations for
                    the men to follow, one of which was:</p>
            <p>That the male membership of the State take particular note of the rapid growth of sentiment toward
                    granting women the rights of franchise –that when the time does arrive that they may be
                    counted on our side and not allow them to be used as a boomerang to defeat us after our years of
                    agitation in their behalf.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In another paragraph she speaks of the need of Socialism's being carried "to
                    every woman wage slave, or slave of a slave in our State. This can best be accomplished by the
                    husband and father, who are already Socialists staying at home with the children and in other ways
                    make it possible for the wife and mother to attend their meetings."</p>
            <p>Working with the woman's correspondent there are at present three hundred dues-paying
                    members standing on the same footing as the men with a voice and vote in the party management. They
                    distribute each week thousands of leaflets on Socialism and Woman's Suffrage, or any
                    literature especially for women, whether they be wage workers or wives of wage earners.</p>
            <p>Aside from party work they never let an opportunity go by to assist in any suffrage demonstration.
                    Before the meeting of the General Assembly in 1913 the State correspondent, Lilith Martin, of
                    Anderson, sent suffrage petitions to all locals in the State for their signatures and for those of
                    their friends. She secured three or four thousand signatures for equal suffrage and gathered the
                    women party leaders together in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> prepared to assist the other organizations of the State that were for equal suffrage.
                    The Equal Franchise bill did not pass the committee but the Socialist women proved their willingness
                    to help the women of the State even if they did have different political views. This co-operation
                    has resulted in placing the Socialist women in a better standing with the other suffragists of the
                    State. Miss Florence Wattles, a prominent Socialist organizer, is a favorite speaker for them. The
                    special work for the women has not been as successful as it was claimed it would be. The women
                    generally prefer to do their work in the locals co-ordinate with the men.</p>

            <p>The activities of the party are kept alive in season and out of season by the lowest unit of
                    organization, the local or branch. This is in reality a political club. "By subscribing to
                    the constitution and the platform of the Socialist party five or more persons may organize a local,
                    subject to the approval of the executive committee." This number has not been changed since
                    the beginning of the party organization.</p>
            <p>It was the intention of the party at first to make the county local the unit. In the constitution of
                    1902, little is said about organization except "Each county organization shall determine
                    its own initiation fees and dues, provided that it shall include ten cents per month for each member
                    to be paid to the State treasurer." In 1904 we again have the county emphasized:</p>
            <p>This organization shall be divided into county organizations to be known as Locals which may in turn
                    be subdivided into subordinate bodies known as branches, but all business with State offices shall
                    be transacted through county organizations. The first organization formed in any county shall be
                    granted jurisdiction in such county, but upon organization of all other branches a county
                    organization must be formed and each additional branch must be given proportional representation in
                    the management of county afrairs.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the present method of organization the local quite as often centers in a town as the county,
                    provided–</p>
            <p>Only one Local may be organized in each town or city; but in townships where no town or city is
                    located each township may contain one Local. A branch shall be a division of a Local and shall
                    constitute a component part thereof and may only be organized and granted a charter by the Local
                    Central Committee.</p>
            <p>The local receives its charter from the State signed by the State chairman and State secretary; the
                    branch from the county or oldest local in the county and it is signed by the county chairman and the
                    county secretary. The conditions are the same as those required for a State charter except they go
                    somewhat further. The local adds State to its national obligations; and the branch, county, to State
                    and national. The committee granting the charter reserves the right to revoke it for violation of
                    its obligations.</p>
            <p>"The following officers, at least, shall be elected by each local: organizer, secretary,
                    financial secretary, literature agent, a chairman and a woman correspondent." The secretary

            <p>The right of membership is inherent in the local. The applicant must present the proper credentials
                    and, if there is any objection to his becoming a member, two-thirds majority is required for
                    admission. The local may expel:</p>
            <p>Any person proved guilty of violating the laws and principles of the organization must be suspended
                    or expelled. Accused shall have written charges preferred against them, signed by the accuser, and
                    furnished a written copy of the same thirty days before trial and allowed a fair and impartial
                    trial. Members must belong to a Local at least three months before casting a vote to expell or

                    advocating any connection with any capitalist or reform party or with any religious or industrial
                    organization.</p>
            <p>The slogan of the local is "Keep Busy." Some locals have in addition to their
                    regular monthly business meeting sessions of study and of pleasure. These meetings are usually held
                    on Sunday as that is the only time the working man cares to attend. The notices of meetings appear
                    in the party papers but seldom in a local one.<hi rend="sup">30</hi> It is the intention to make the
                    coming together a means of holding Socialists together and keep up their enthusiasm and to attract
                    outsiders so as to make converts of them.</p>
            <p>Methods of propaganda are discussed and campaigns are mapped out and followed up between meetings by
                    circulating <hi rend="i">The Appeal</hi> and as they say, "If that does not bring a man in,
                    then try <hi rend="i">The Rip Saw</hi> and it will fetch him." Some get lists of
                    subscribers to their party papers and follow up those routes by a canvass to sell literature. Books
                    are borrowed from public libraries and loaned to persons whose taste prefers a bound book to a
                    pamphlet.</p>

            <p>Another feature of the local meetings is the appointment of committees to investigate the conditions
                    of the poor in their vicinity. They go from house to house and see if there are any cases of real

                    who may eventually be won to party membership.</p>

            <p>A study of Socialist methods of membership will show something distinctly original in American
                    politics.</p>
            <p>It is not necessary to be a voter in order to join the Socialist party. At first any one sixteen
                    years old, later changed to eighteen years, without question as to color, sex, creed, or previous
                    condition of political servitude unless this party service was not under civil service is eligible.</p>
            <p>In order to become a member of the party an applicant must subscribe to the following:</p>
            <p>I, the undersigned, recognizing the class struggle between the capitalist class and the working
                    class, and the necessity of the working class constituting itself into a political party distinct
                    from and opposed to all parties formed by the capitalist class, hereby declare that I have severed
                    my relations with all other parties, and I endorse the platform and constitution of the Socialist
                    Party including the principle of political action, and hereby apply for admission to said party.</p>

            <p>The original application is kept with the recording secretary of the local or branch with which the
                    application is made and a duplicate is sent to the State committee unless the county has a central
                    committee, in which case it goes through their hands to the State committee.</p>
            <p>A careful watch is kept lest some one is brought into the fold who is not orthodox. It is not numbers
                    of members but quality that is demanded. The following item shows what is liable to happen whenever
                    there are any irregularities:</p>

            </p>
            <p>Another original feature in political organization is the dues-paying system. Its financial support
                    as well as its political depends upon the working people and those in sympathy with them. They have
                    a voice and a vote in all the party affairs from the selection of the officers of the local to
                    national committeemen from their State. Through the referendum they have a voice in national affairs
                    of the party.</p>
            <p>When a member is admitted to the party membership he receives a red card which is now used as a cover
                    for the State constitution of the party. Up to 1913 the folder was separate but it was thought
                    better to make the change, "The purpose being that each applicant becoming a member of the

            <p>The face of the folding card has blanks to fill in name, address, date of admission, State and local.
                    The back of it has blanks to fill for transfer record. Inside there is placed a scheme for receipts

            <p>The due stamps are small adhesive ones not quite so large as a postage stamp. The sale of these is
                    the only sure support of the party. The national office prints them and sends them to the State
                    secretary so that the office receives five cents for each member, excluding those whose affiliation
                    is kept up by exemption stamps. The member so elected is called a "red card"
                    Socialist to distinguish him from other factions. The secretary-treasurer sells these stamps to the
                    Locals or Branches for a "sum equal to fifteen cents for each due stamp. Ten per cent of
                    the dues received by the State office each month shall be set aside as mileage fund for delegates to
                    the State Convention" and the balance, after the national office receives its pay, goes to
                    support the State offices.</p>
            <p>The monthly dues are payable on the first day of each month. Any member in arrears for three months
                    will not be deemed in good standing, and shall not be entitled to vote on referendum or in
                    convention, provided that this shall not apply to regular members who are unable to pay.</p>
            <p>The local or branch sells the due stamps for twenty-five cents and ten cents of this sum maintains
                    the Local organization. Any one living in a locality where there is no Local may apply to the
                    secretary-treasurer for admission to membership and enclose one month's dues. The dues of
                    members-at-large are twenty-five cents per month. The secretary-treasurer keeps a careful record of
                    all receipts and expenditures of dues and makes an annual report to the Locals of the State and the
                    delegates to the State convention and each month in the <hi rend="i">Socialist Party Indiana
                        Bulletin</hi> sends to the locals reports of the receipts of the previous month and the same
                    month a year before so that each one may know if the funds are increasing.</p>
            <p>The following figures show the dues paid in Indiana for the past eleven years: 1903,
                    $419.06 (8 months); 1904, $732.35; 1905, $717.25; 1906,
                    $1,135.85; 1907, $851.13; 1908, $1,886.22; 1909,
                    $1,660.39; 1910, $2,262.00; 1911, $3,742.51; 1912,
                    $4,769.15; 1913, $3,414.80.</p>
            <p>It will be observed by the above table that campaign years produce better results than off years, yet
                    the figures show a healthful growth; and that while some members take a Rip Van Winkle sleep they
                    can be revived and depended upon. The cause suffers for a short time and then recovers.</p>
            <p>There are other causes than lack of interest that may cause a retrenching in funds.</p>
            <pb n="110" id="VAA4025-012-2-016"/>
            <p>In the latter three months of the year of 1913 there has been quite a number of exempt stamps called
                    for, probably more of these stamps were used in the last three or four months in Indiana than all
                    times since the exemption stamps have been in use in the Party.<hi rend="sup">34</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is another purpose besides financing the party that the dues system serves. It keeps the party
                    organization in touch with its constituents and forbids some new advocate from stepping into places
                    of trust and taking the reins out of the hands of the "war horses."</p>
            <p>No member shall be nominated for civil office on the Socialist ticket, nor for office in the party
                    organization unless he has been a member of the party for two years preceding the nomination;
                    provided, that this shall not prevent nominations in political subdivisions where there has been no
                    organization for so long a period.</p>
            <p>The revenue of this organization shall be derived from the sale of dues, stamps, party supplies,
                    literature and from pledges and contributions from individuals and Locals.</p>
            <p>The publicity of campaign funds was fundamental with the Socialists and was done before there was a
                    law requiring it.</p>
            <p>The platform speaker of the Socialist party is not only a speaker to rally the party and get new
                    converts to it, but he is an organizer. If five members may be found where there is no organization
                    or if by reason of indifference the Local has lapsed when it once had existed, it is the duty to
                    form a local.</p>
            <p>The organizers receive a salary varying from two dollars to five per day and expenses. In the
                    beginning of the party propaganda the organizer spoke on the street because few halls would be open
                    on account of prejudice or lack of pay. Now if they speak on the street corner it is from choice.
                    The speakers take up collections and sell literature. The literature is sold to the State office
                    from the national at wholesale price. The organizers sell at retail price and the difference between
                    these two prices goes to the State organization.</p>
            <p>In 1912 there were thirteen speakers in the field with a total of 856 days out.<hi rend="sup">35</hi>
                    The amount of literature sales was $864.00 While the speakers receive a regular salary
                    and expenses, the amount they turn over to the State frequently balances their expenses. Locals
                    sometimes secure speakers independently of the State committee <list type="footnotes">

            <p>There is an enormous amount of pamphlets given away, 21,700 free ones being sent to some weak Locals
                    in one month. Tons of free literature have been sent out from the State headquarters.</p>
            <p>The lyceum department of the national office sends speakers out at their own expense. They usually
                    spend ten or twelve days in a State and speak each day. Mr. W. A. Jacobs, of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>, spoke on "Political Power" in Indiana last campaign.</p>
            <p>The function and name organizer dates back to the Social Democratic party. Messrs. Evinger,
                    Thorndyke, Oneal, Greuling and Thornton were in the field for the Social Democratic Party. Messrs.
                    J. W. Kelly and A. S. Edwards made tours of the state in October following the unity convention.</p>
            <p>The party is by no means nailed down on the question of organizers. Each convention sees some change
                    made. They have had county organizers, district and State, elected by Locals, in the case of the
                    county and district and State by the convention, but in reality any sanctioned speaker is an
                    organizer.</p>

            <p>One of the most interesting ways that the party manifests itself is through its State convention. Up
                    to 1914 the party held a convention each year, usually in February, for the purpose of naming
                    candidates for party officers who serve one year and civil offices on election years but by a recent
                    decision, "A State Convention shall be held bi-annually in the month of May during the
                    years when civil officers are to be elected. Special conventions may be held at any time if decided
                    upon by a general vote of party membership."</p>
            <p>The exact time and the place of the convention is decided by the State committee. <placeName>

            <p>The announcement for the call for the convention is sent by the State chairman to each Local about
                    sixty days before the time of meeting. The call for February 14, 1914, read as follows:</p>

                                    State convention to start in the campaign of 1914. Capitalism is still here and
                                    there is nothing left for the Socialist party but continue its work till this

            <p>The convention meets in some obscure place where a hall may be had for a small sum. The newspapers
                    give little or no publicity to the meeting. The city where it meets does not take on convention
                    aspect, and decorate with flags, bunting and pictures of favorite sons. There are no crowded hotels
                    with their all-night before caucuses and bosses dropping in now and then just for friendship sake.</p>
            <p>The convention hall and the delegates present just as much contrast as may be seen in the convention
                    city. The hall is not decorated; its doors are wide open to the public. The delegates are not
                    politicians with special interests who come to represent a constituency that have not awakened to
                    the fact that there is to be a convention until it is all over and all settled. Our forefathers were
                    not more serious in their conventions.</p>
            <p>The Locals are thoroughly alive from the time of the call for the convention; in fact their interest
                    is aroused three months before the meeting, for at this time they are called upon to nominate a
                    committee of five on the State constitution which must be elected in the manner provided for taking
                    referendum. Each Local is allowed to send one delegate and one additional one for each twenty-five
                    members. The members-at-large are represented in the same <list type="footnotes">

                    constitution receive in addition car fare and two dollars per day. Their time begins the day before
                    the convention and ends as soon as the constitution is adopted by the convention.</p>
            <p>The convention is called to order by the State chairman. The delegates name by ballot the temporary
                    chairman so that it is not safe for any man to come to the convention with a ready prepared speech
                    in his pocket, for no one can foresee who will receive the honor. His presence is not heralded by
                    the usual scream and shout. He does not rattle the dry bones of party leaders for several reasons,
                    His party is new and it is a party that exists upon principles and not upon leaders.</p>
            <p>Even the credentials committee is elected so that there is no possible chance for wire pulling. The
                    only permanent offices that hold through the convention, and these are not necessarily so, are the
                    secretary, two tellers, and a sergeant-at-arms, but even these must be named and elected at each
                    session by the delegates. The committees are elected in the same way as the officers. The most
                    important committees are as follows: credentials, rules and order, platform and resolutions,
                    grievances, auditing. The constitution committee is one of the important ones but it is now chosen
                    by referendum.</p>
            <p>A new chairman is elected for each session and no man need flatter himself that he is in such demand
                    that he may be chairman for more than one session. It is a matter of education for chairman and
                    delegate. They have made the rules so they ought to know them and if they should forget they have
                    copies of the State constitution in their hands. Time is of no consequence, to be right is
                    everything. The stake for which they play is not to be measured in dollars and cents in the way of
                    patronage but it must stand the scrutiny of the party members for all time to come.</p>
            <p>Each delegate who wants the floor rises and shouts, "Comrade Chairman!"
                    until some one is recognized by the chair then the one recognized must preface his remarks by
                    announcing his name and the name of his Local. He is allowed but five minutes in which to speak and
                    no delegate is permitted to speak twice upon the same subject until all have spoken unless the
                    convention grants him this privilege. Frequently there are a dozen on the floor shouting for a
                    hearing and will not be pacified until the chairman assures them that he will hear each one of them
                    if they stay there until midnight. <pb n="114" id="VAA4025-012-2-020"/> The State committee has a
                    voice but no vote in the convention. The constitution committee have a voice when the constitution
                    is discussed but they have no vote unless they are delegates.</p>
            <p>Instead of visits from detached missionaries who go around to tighten the wires there are calls from
                    the members of the various committees who are obliged to sit in another room but who pull themselves
                    away long enough to look in and see what is going on.</p>
            <p>There is little emotionalism, almost no cheering, but a grim, deep-set determination pervading the
                    atmosphere. When the time comes for nominating party and civil officers there is no lack of names
                    presented. Each delegate is bent on having some one from his Local named. As many as six persons
                    were named for some of the offices in 1914. The delegates to the State convention occupied seats in

                    </placeName> Locals outnumbered the rest. The rank and file sat back of the delegates. When a vote
                    was taken <hi rend="i">viva voce</hi> there was much consternation lest the persons without
                    authority to do so were voting. They were so democratic that they allowed themselves to be voted out
                    of the right to smoke in the convention hall. They are ever mindful of their mission in behalf of
                    their comrades.</p>
            <p>The Locals have a right to send recommendations that they want to have considered in the convention.
                    These are referred to the proper committees and are reported when the regular report is made. In
                    subject-matter the convention resembles the <placeName>

                    private matters such as an attack on the character of some member. There is now and then a fling at
                    the capitalist class and the capitalist laws but there lies under all a desire to better present
                    conditions and make their work constructive rather than destructive. Collections are taken for the
                    families of any organization known to be in want either from strikes or lack of work.<hi rend="sup">8T</hi> AW sorts oi petitions ate sent to the Federal and State authorities. Their manner of

            <p>The personnel of the convention is not as might be expected, a gathering of working people. In the
                    convention of 1914 there might be seen the lawyer, the student, the society lady, the working man
                    and woman. The race variations were equally noticeable, white, <list type="footnotes">

                        <settlement type="city">Valparaiso</settlement>
                    </placeName>. All seemed to discuss questions of State with equal ease and interest. There were a
                    few women delegates and while the party is fundamentally pledged to equal rights their years of
                    heredity in which men have dominated in political matters manifested itself quite frequently and the
                    women seemingly were forgotten.</p>
            <p>The convention sessions are long, with intermissions at lunch time when people go to some nearby
                    lunch room and hasten back. No one thinks of leaving the room but for a short time even when the
                    sessions run through the night. At least two full days are given to a convention, closing on Sunday.</p>
            <p>The final close of the convention is one rousing union of voices in singing the Marseillaise by
                    substituting "Ye Sons of Toil" for "Ye Sons of <placeName>

            <p>The State convention is followed up by the referendums on the civil and party officers and on the
                    constitution. The referendum for selecting nominees for State and party offices is arranged like the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> ballot, all nominees are given in parallel columns with a square at the left side of
                    the name in which to check the preferred name.</p>
            <p>The referendum on the constitution gives the proposed constitution in full and leaves a space on each
                    side of each section. The space on the left hand side is for yes and the right for no.</p>
            <p>Enough referendums are sent to each local so that a copy may be in the hands of each member. The
                    local tabulates the votes and sends the report to the State headquarters. It sometimes happens that
                    there is no choice so another referendum is sent out. A limited time, usually about thirty days, is
                    set to close all referendums.</p>
            <p>The campaign methods are much the same as those used by any other political party. More organizers
                    are sent into the field than at other times. A preference is shown to districts that have nominated
                    full tickets. The national office sends out speakers to the places where they are most needed.

            <p>They follow the regular campaign style of putting in the windows the pictures of favorite candidates.
                    Pictures are worn on neckties, flaunted from pennants or they may be used on buttons. Party emblems
                    are used on buttons and pennants, also tie clips, and cuff buttons. The red flag badge may be the
                    favorite of some of the adherents. Probably no larger percentage of Socialists take part in these
                    demonstrations than in the old line parties.</p>
            <p>The real work of the party goes on all the time and few votes are gained by the red fire method. It
                    requires the educational one to win converts. When a Socialist is once enrolled he is not liable to
                    compromise his vote. The results of the elections show the abiding character of the voters: <list type="footnotes">

                    the State. The year 1912 showed the greatest gains. All counties except <placeName>

            <p>A comparison of election returns shows that the party must be gaining by drawing from other political
                    parties. More votes were cast for Mr. Bryan in 1908 than were cast for Mr. Wilson and more votes
                    were cast for Mr. Taft than were cast in 1912 for Messrs. Taft and Roosevelt together.<hi rend="sup">41</hi>

                    message "No Compromise, No Political Trading!" The statement issued by

                        State.<hi rend="sup">43</hi> The party must win on its principles.</p>
            <p>The victories in the State are accompanied by its responsibilities.</p>
            <p>These victories indicate that the Socialists of Indiana are now approaching a period of
                    responsibility, a period when we will find ourselves carried into public office by a revolutionary
                    working class. It is all the more necessary, therefore, that our electoral campaigns shall be waged
                    on the clearest presentation of the issue between the working class and its exploiters, and that
                    extra precaution should be taken in nominating our candidates.<hi rend="sup">44</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The party is gaining ground in converting the union men to party principles. Forty per cent, of the
                    union men of the State have endorsed the Socialist principles, according to the report of the State
                    secretary, William Henry.</p>

            <p>Socialists are well united and grounded on the fundamental principles but they find enough difference
                    in methods of work to form controversies that appear to be a serious menace to the ultimate aim of
                    the party. Foremost in the conflict may be found The Industrial Workers of the World, who were
                    organized in 1905 with a constitution and a division into units called locals but they differ from
                    the Socialists in the collective ownership, management and distribution of the means of life, but
                    they do not believe in political action but direct. By direct action they do not mean violence but
                    they will achieve their purpose by simply refusing to deliver coal, bread, clothing, etc.</p>

                    button in these words: "We want the earth now." The regular campaign speakers used
                    the old platform as a basis for their remarks and ignored the "direct actionists"

            <p>A controversy which seems likely to divide the party has arisen in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Anderson</settlement>
                    </placeName>. One faction known as the Critchley-McDonald-Hunter, organized as Socialists, renounced
                    the dues-paying system of the party as a violation of the Corrupt Practices Act, held a convention
                    for the nomination of municipal offices to which all persons in sympathy with reform in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Anderson</settlement>
                    </placeName> were invited to take part, claiming that the "dues-paying" party is
                    in the minority and does not represent the Socialist vote. They nominated Mr. Critchley for Mayor.
                    He had never belonged to the Red-card Socialist party. This faction captured the Anderson <hi rend="i">Critic</hi>, a supposed Socialist paper. <hi rend="sup">47</hi> They had the support of
                    some of the ministers. They also succeeded in securing the recognition of the election commissioners
                    of the city so that the local had to go on the ballot in the city election under another party name
                    and party emblem. <hi rend="sup">48</hi> The local protested for the rights and secured an attorney
                    to represent them in the court but they were not sustained. The national office sent Mr. Carl D.
                    Thompson to the scene of conflict, October 13, 1913. He spent nearly a week in hearing the testimony
                    on both sides and after going over the evidence submitted vindicated the local. The State convention
                    sustained the local and refused to seat any delegate from the faction.</p>
            <p>The Grievance Committee reported at the State convention February 14, 15, 1914, that Ira Tilton of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Valparaiso</settlement>
                    </placeName> Local was guilty of charges of slander and anarchy against a member of the party. The
                    convention sustained the committee after hearing the evidence on both sides and recommended that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Valparaiso</settlement>
                    </placeName> Local expel said member. The local refused to do this and he has since been nominated
                    for Congress from his district. The State organization can not expel an individual but it can expel
                    a local or a district, so the district is now under the ban.</p>
            <p>Mr. Debs thinks that these differences of opinion are disciplinary and tests of mettle and will
                    eventually result in good for the strength of the party.</p>
            <p>When Indiana came into the Union it was preeminently an agricultural State. When its present

            <p>The coal fields are centers for workingmen grouped either in the county seats or in villages made up
                    of miners. The Socialist party finds this region its most fertile soil. The miners are almost all
                    foreigners, among which Germans and Jews predominate.</p>

            <p>Socialism does not appeal to the prosperous farmer living in river bottoms or near the great
                    manufacturing centers where he finds a ready market but in the southern part of the State where the
                    soil is naturally not very fertile and conditions in general not favorable there is much discontent
                    with existing affairs and this finds a chance for expression in the Socialist party. Propaganda
                    first and organization afterward has always been the plan of the Socialists.</p>
            <p>Before the battles of freedom there have always appeared the writers, the orators, the artists, and
                    the singers. Rousseau defying "Logic of Liberty," Tom Paine, calling for freedom
                    from the king; and Patrick Henry, as large as his times, fearlessly announcing new doctrines to take
                    the place of decadent ideals; Lincoln and others pleading for the chattel slave, and in our time,
                    multiplying voices crying aloud for complete freedom from wage slavery, subtlest and meanest of all
                    forms of human slavery.</p>
            <p>Chief among the editors stands Julius A. Wayland, born in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Versailles</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, in 1854. His father died when he was three months old. He was intimately
                    acquainted with poverty but he gradually rose from "devil" to editor, removed to <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="cou">Colorado</region>
                    </placeName>, where he prospered and through investments in real estate he found himself a rich man.</p>
            <p>The tide turned in 1890, as he says:</p>
            <p>I accidentally fell into a conversation about some strike on a railroad with Mr. Bradfield, an
                    English shoemaker, who had a little shop on Union Avenue, and he gave me a pamphlet to read on the
                    subject of the economic or Socialist view point. To be brief, he landed me good and hard. I saw a
                    new light and found what I never before knew existed. I went into the financial study so thoroughly
                    that the result was, 1 closed up my real <pb n="123" id="VAA4025-012-2-029"/> estate business and
                    devoted my whole energies to the work of trying to get my neighbors to see truths as I ha dlearned
                        them.<hi rend="sup">49</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This conviction led him to return to newspaper business and he removed to his native State and
                    selected <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Greensburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, for his enterprise because of its being near the center of population in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. He had plenty of money to run a paper for several years even if the subscribers were
                    not forthcoming. His paper called the <hi rend="i">Coming Nation</hi> was the first propaganda
                    Socialist paper to be published wholly in the interests of the party. The subscription list ran up
                    to 65,000, but the unexpected happened. His paper circulated chiefly in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> and among the Populists of the West and his being near the center of population was of
                    no avail. The proceeds of the paper were to be used for founding a colony, which purpose was carried
                    out in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Ruskin</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tenn.</region>
               </placeName>, but unsuccessfully, so he removed to Girard and started the <hi rend="i">Appeal to Reason</hi>, which he successfully edited until his death, November 10, 1912.
                    After nearly two years it seems that the vow that was made by the acting editor–namely:
                        <hi rend="i">"The Appeal</hi> will continue its work until the dreams of our departed
                    comrade have been realized"– may come true, for it is still the widest
                    circulated of any Socialist paper.<hi rend="sup">50</hi> Mr. Wayland said, "Our lives are
                    but atoms–remember millions are to follow us. What we now enjoy others gave their lives
                    for. They did not shirk because they did not realize results." <hi rend="sup">51</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The newspaper as a means of State-party influence has not met with much success. Efforts were made
                    when the party was organized to publish a State paper but did not receive sufficient approval to
                    warrant its publication.<hi rend="sup">52</hi> Some fear that if there, is a recognized official

            <p>A new enterprise in the newspaper business started in the summer of 1910. A Socialist toured western <placeName>

                    </placeName> and eastern Indiana in the interest of the Finley Publishing Company of Finley, O. The
                    Socialists in that city had purchased a complete printing outfit and were endeavoring to establish a
                    chain of Socialist newspapers in the above mentioned district. Each Socialist Local was solicited to
                    take twenty shares at $10 per share. This entitled them to a paper. The whole chain of
                    papers was printed alike, leaving from two to four columns for Local's news, which was to
                    be filled in by the organization supporting it. The papers were to be locally named. Many Locals
                    took stock in the concern which seemed in a fair way to solve the problem when the flood washed away
                    the printing establishment in Finley.</p>

               <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion</region>
                    </placeName> has been the most active town in the State in late years in trying to run a paper. It
                    was in the Finley affair and called the local paper <hi rend="i">Freedom's Banner</hi>,
                    but the proposition was soon abandoned. Their next attempt was <hi rend="i">The <placeName>
                            <region type="county">Marion</region>
                        </placeName> Socialist</hi>, which was printed occasionally when the Socialists felt that they
                    had something to say of more than ordinary importance. The Socialists pledged to distribute 5,000
                    copies and on the strength of this pledge sufficient money was received from advertisements to pay
                    the printer. About eight copies of the paper were published.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="i">Economic Intelligencer</hi> sprang up as a result of the tremendous vote cast by the
                    party in 1912 in Grant county. After the election a temporary organization was formed looking
                    towards the establishment of a company for the publishing of a Socialist and Trade Union paper in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion</region>
                    </placeName>. The company was incorporated under the laws of the State with an authorized capital
                    stock of $10,000. The paper lasted from May 8, 1913, to December of the same year, when
                    it went into the hands of a receiver. All the <pb n="125" id="VAA4025-012-2-031"/> affairs were
                    adjusted satisfactorily by April of 1914 and the company again came into the control of the paper.
                    The management was changed when the receiver was released and a new management was appointed and is
                    now publishing the same paper under a new name, the <hi rend="i">Labor Sentinel</hi>, with Wilbur
                    Sheron as editor and publisher.</p>

                        <region type="county">Marion</region>
                    </placeName> is typical of what is going on in all the largest towns in the State. Anderson has had
                    at three different times small papers in the field, but hardly dignified enough to be called
                    newspapers. One of these papers was called <hi rend="i">The Issue</hi> and its circulation was about
                    four thousand per week, by free distribution. It was used in campaigns, mostly, but was kept going
                    through the winter of 1910-11. "The devotion of our members who voluntarily tramped through
                    the snows of an unusually severe winter to deliver the paper from house to house was merely another
                    instance of the indomitable spirit which has kept the working class press alive in the face of
                    almost insurmountable obstacles."</p>
            <p>There is a plan to revive <hi rend="i">The Issue</hi> and make it a permanent paper. They have a
                    society called "The Workers' Publishing Society," which is engaged at
                    present in collecting the necessary funds to enable them to purchase the equipment. The paper will
                    be owned by the society, and the work of editing, printing, etc., will be performed entirely by
                    volunteer labor at first. They hope to have the paper ready for propaganda in the fall elections.</p>

            <p>The newspaper work of the party is a reminder of that of the Abolitionists in methods and crudeness
                    of machinery. An editor and one helper running a hand printing press often constitute the office
                    force. The papers are distributed by members of the party after their day's work is done,
                    often tramping through snow to perform this labor of love but thoroughly intelligent on the subjects
                    of the struggles of the working class and not loath to stop and discuss them when an interested

            <p>It is estimated that sixty per cent, of the converts to Socialism have been won by the printed word.
                    The National Office maintains a literature department and publishes books that will have a

                    that all books must be published by this office, for an author is at liberty to have his work done

                    </placeName>, November 5, 1855. James Whitcomb Riley said, "God was feeling mighty good
                    when he created 'Gene Debs and he didn't have anything else to do all
                    day." Mr. Debs was a member of a large family. He quit school and went to work at the age
                    of fifteen and became a locomotive engineer. He says of this period, "I mastered the
                    curriculum and graduated with the degree D. D., not as the lexicons interpret the letters, Doctor of
                    Divinity, but the better signification, Do and Dare." <hi rend="sup">58</hi> It was in the
                    capacity of a railroader that Mr. Debs became interested in the problem of the working people.
                    "Separate him from the revolutionary working class movement and you lose Eugene V. Debs. He
                    is bone of its bone, flesh of its flesh. His very life, his hopes and aims, are interwoven into the
                    very mesh of the labor movement." <hi rend="sup">59</hi> He joined the Brotherhood of
                    Locomotive Firemen and became the secretary and treasurer. He organized the American Railway Union
                    in 1894. This was the first organization which took in all laborers. He arbitrated the Great
                    Northern strike and received this commendation from President Hill, "You have fought a good

                    given away, and that he resigned from a position that was paying him four thousand a year and that
                    he has paid the last bit of a debt of forty thousand dollars deficit left when the A. R. U.
                    disbanded. The debt was simply a moral obligation. He has written scores of pamphlets, some have

            <p>In propriety nobody could be called Sieur de Vincennes except a holder of this fief, for there was no

                    title. That he was still Sieur de Vincennes on July 9, 1717, has been conclusively demonstrated by
                    Mr. Edmond Mallet, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>

                    Vol. 3, No. 2.) It is therefore practically certain that he was the man of whom De Vaudreuil wrote,
                    on Oct. 28, 1719: "I learn from the last letters that have arrived from the Miamis, that
                    Sieur de Vincennes having died in their village, these Indians had resolved not to move to the
                        <geogName>River St. Joseph</geogName>." (N. Y. Col. Docs. Vol. 9, p. 894.) That this
                    village was Kikakon (later corrupted to Ke-ki-un-gi–site of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Ft. Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>) is established by the fact that in 1749, Captain Celeron appealed to La

                    to 1736, when he was killed in battle with the Chickasaws, there was a man in the French service
                    universally known, in all official and other correspondence, as Sieur de Vincennes, and this man was
                    the founder of our Indiana post. The local clues to his identity were practically exhausted by Judge

                    Oua-bache;" the same deed expressing that Madame Vinsenne was absent at the Post. Her
                    signature being necessary to the deed, she sent her mark, or cross, wh'ich is testified
                    to as hers, "X the mark of Madame Vinsenne," and showing that the good lady was
                    not very far advanced in the rudiments, though her husband was commandant, and her father the
                    wealthiest citizen of <placeName>

                    </placeName>. The will of Monsieur Longprie, his father-in-law, dated the 10th of March, 1735, gives
                    to him, among other things, 408 lbs. of pork, which he wishes "kept safe until the arrival
                    of Mons. Vinsenne,' who was then at the Post. There are other documents there signed by
                    him as a witness, in 1733-4; among them one of a receipt for 100 pistoles, received from his
                    father-in-law, on his marriage. From all these proofs, I think it evident that he was here previous
                    to 1733, and left with his command, on an expedition against the Chickasaws, in 1736, by orders from
                    his superior officer at <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, its present appellation, was made as early as 1749. Why or wherefore I do not know. I
                    wish the original orthography had been observed, and the name spelled after its founder, with the
                    "s" instead of the "c," as it should be.</p>

                        burned with Father Senat on the day of the fight, from 3 o'clock in the afternoon to
                        midnight. The other officers who were burned were officers and militiamen. Sieur Courselas, or
                        Coustillas, officer, was burned three days later at the large village, with an Iroquois from the
                        Sault St. Louis; Sieur Courselas had been detailed with 35 men to guard the ammunition. Being
                        misled he came to the village of the Chickasaws without knowing where he was going. He was not
                        able to learn what became of the 35 Frenchmen who were with Courselas. He was conducted to the
                        cabin of the chief of the village of Joutalla, where he was guarded for six months by the young
                        men, after which he was given full liberty, and hunted with the Chickasaws."</item>

            <p>1746–On the 24th of January, 1656, the vestry-board of the parish of Notre Dame de Quebec
                    conceded to Frangois Bissot, Sieur de la Riviere, a pew of six feet in length by three and one-half
                    feet in depth in the <pb n="138" id="VAA4025-012-2-044"/> said church, to possess for himself and
                    his heirs in perpetuity, in consideration of one hundred livres once paid, and the ordinary dues of
                    said parish at each replacing. Originally this pew was below the railing and seats of the
                    choristers; in 1729 it was the second in the middle row on the left-hand side of the altar.</p>
            <p>At the death of Bissot. in 1678, his son-in-law, Louis Jolliet, on account of his wife, Claire
                    Franchise Bissot, and also, it is alleged, on account of services rendered as organist of the parish
                    of Quebec, had the possession of this pew until his decease, in 1700 and thereafter his wife Claire,
                    Bissot, also to her decease in 1710.</p>
            <p>Then succeeded to the wife of Jolliet, as occupant of the pew of Bissot, her daughter Claire Jolliet,
                    who had married Joseph de Fleury, Sieur de la Gorgendiere, Seigneur D'Eschambault. The
                    13th of March, 1720, the vestry-board of Quebec accorded regularly the possession of the pew of
                    Bissot to Sieur de la Gorgendiere, aforesaid.</p>
            <p>On the 8th of April, 1729, Francois Bissot, the son, citizen of Quebec, by the agency of Jacques
                    Delafontaine Balcour, his son-in-law, brought action against the vestry-board of Quebec to compel it
                    to put him In possession of the pew of his father, occupied by the Sieur de la Gorgendiere, offering
                    to pay all the expense of the replacement.</p>
            <p>The vestry-board answered that it was not able to avoid conceding the pew in question to Sieur La
                    Gorgendiere, as having married Claire Jolliet, grand-daughter of Bissot, there being then present no
                    other persons claiming as heirs of the late Sieur Bissot.</p>
            <p>Francois Bissot, who never took the title "De Vincennes" in this procedure, replied
                    that if he had not previously claimed the possession of his father's pew, it was because
                    he came to this city only once a year, and that he had not been called to the hearing of the
                    vestry-board because he would have opposed it; but that it had never taken away from him the right
                    which accrued to him by the title of concession to the said deceased Sieur Bissot, his father. The
                    vestry-board contested this action before the Provost, and on May 3 following judgment was rendered
                    in favor of Francois Bissot, who possessed it until his death; likewise his wife also until her
                    death in 1745.</p>
            <p>In 1746 still another contest arose concerning the possession of this pew. Nicolas Boisseau,
                    Secretary Judge of the King, and Chief Clerk of the Council, in his capacity of husband of Louise
                    Bissot, and of representative of Marguerite Forestier, widow of Jean Bissot de Vincennes, his
                    mother-in-law, claimed possession of the said pew against Jacques de la Fontaine, counsellor, who
                    had married Charlotte Bissot, daughter and heiress of Francois Bissot, the son, who had continued to
                    possess this pew since the death of his mother-in-law.</p>
            <p>The heirs of Francois Bissot represented, among other things, that Sieur Francois Bissot, the son,
                    was put in possession of the pew of his father only in 1729, that is to say after the death of his
                    elder brother, the Sieur de Vincennes; and that if there was any right of primogeniture in this
                    matter, it did not belong to the Sieur de Vincennes, who had never taken possession; moreover the
                    wife of Sieur Boisseau well knew that the <pb n="139" id="VAA4025-012-2-045"/> ancestors who would
                    have been able to contest this were dead, and that she ought not to ignore that she had a brother
                    married with all the ceremonies of the church to an <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> or Miami woman, who had left male children to whom the right of primogeniture belonged
                    in preference to her.</p>
            <p>The brief of Boisseau representing the widow Bissot de Vincennes is not present in the package of
                    papers which has come to our hands; but one can see, from the reply of the adverse party, that the
                    chief argument of his brief was the right which Jean-Baptiste Bissot de Vincennes had, as eldest
                    son, to succeed to his father in the possession of the pew. One sees that, in response to the brief
                    of Delafontaine, Boisseau declares: "That it is unquestionable that the late Sieur de
                    Vincennes, the son, of whom the said Delafontaine speaks in his writing, did not leave any male
                    heir." It was finally ordered that the widow of the late Sieur de Vincennes, as well as the
                    Sieurs Delafontaine and Boisseau, in their names, possess in common, each one-third of the pew in
                    question; and that after the death of the widow <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boisseau</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Delafontaine</settlement>
                    </placeName> both possess in equal parts. On the occasion of this procedure, I note that the wife of
                    the late Jean Bissot de Vincennes signed her name as follows: "Marguerite Forrestier, veuve
                    Vencene."</p>
            <p>From all this it follows that Jean Baptiste Bissot de Vincennes, who gave his name to the capital of
                    Indiana, had for godfather the celebrated Intenant Talon; that in 1687 he was about to depart to <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>; and that finally, in 1694, he signed, "Bissot Vensenne."</p>
            <p>It appears also clearly established that Jean Bissot de Vincennes was dead in 1729, and in
                    consequence it was his son who was burned by the Chlckasaws in 1736; that this son was married to an
                    Indian woman, that he had no male child, and that he was dead in 1746 at the time of the last
                    contest for the pew of his ancestor.</p>
            <p>The letter of Toussaint Loizel appears to contradict the writers who have spoken of this famous
                    battle with the Chickasaws in 1736, when they claim that it occured in May, whereas it could not
                    have taken place after the 14th of April, the date on which Loizel wrote, who furnished a
                    description with such detail that it cannot be mistaken.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> of Quebec before us, Frederic Haldimand, captain-general and governor-in-chief of the
                    Province of Quebec and territories and dependencies in America, vice-admiral and keeper of the great
                    seal of the same, general and commandant-in-chief of the troops of His Majesty in the said province
                    and frontiers, etc, Sieur Joseph Roy, seigneur and proprietor of the fief and seignory of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, situate in the district of Quebec, which applicant has said to us that he comes before
                    us to render and bring to the Castle of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> of Quebec the liege fealty and homage which he is held to render and bring to his Very
                    Excellent Majesty George III on account of said fief and seignory as hereunder set forth and has
                    shewn us as titles of his ownership: First, an authentic copy of a concession given and accorded by
                    M. Talon, former Intendant in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New France</settlement>
                    </placeName>, November 3, 1672, to Sieur Bissot of seventy arpents of land front by a league in
                    depth to be taken on the River St. Lawrence from the lands belonging to Sieur de la CitiSre to the
                    lands not conceded, for him, his heirs and assigns to enjoy the said land in fief and seignory,
                    irrevocably, charged with rendering faith and homage at the Castle of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> of Quebec, by which he will discharge the accustomed dues and rents according to
                    custom, to keep or cause to be kept domicile and residence on the said seignory, to conserve or
                    cause to be conserved the oak trees suitable for the construction of vessels; to inform the King of
                    any mines, minerals or ores, if any are found within the said fief, and to permit all necessary
                    roads and ways. Second, writ of adjudication by decree given in the office of the Provost <pb n="142" id="VAA4025-012-2-048"/> of Quebec, August 10, 1749, to Sieur Joseph lioy, the father of
                    said applicant, of said fief and seignory of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> and dependencies, on paying the sum of 5,600 livres, on the back of which writ is the
                    receipt of 11. Master Francois Etienne Cugnet, Director of the Domains of the King, to the said
                    Sieur Joseph lioy, for the sums of S40 livres for the right to a fifth part, one fourth being
                    deducted from the principal of the said adjudication, dated August 21, 1749. Third, a deed passed
                    before Panet and his associate notaries at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quebec</settlement>
                    </placeName> March 25, 1759, making partition between Jean Corpron and Marie lioy, his wife, both in
                    said name and as guardian of the minor children of the late Pierre Eeval and Charlotte Roy, his
                    wife, the plaintiff and Marie Gabriel Sarranlt, his wife and Charles Lecours and Marguerite lioy,
                    his wife, of the estate of the late Joseph Roy and Marie Jeanne Couture; by which it appears that
                    the said Corpron and Lecours have ceded to the said plaintiff and his wife the said fief and
                    seignory of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> in entirety for the compensation of a life-rent of 525 livres to the widow of the late
                    Joseph Roy, their father and father-in-law, and in addition the sum of 3,000 livres, balance in
                    partition: Which are all the titles the said plaintiff has stated he had to present to us, asking
                    that it may please us to receive the fealty and liege homage which he is bound to render for the
                    said fief and seignory of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, renewing in full fief of His Majesty; and at the time, putting himself in the attitude
                    of a vassal, with uncovered head, without sword or spurs, and with one knee on the ground he
                    declared in a loud and intelligible voice that he rendered and 'brought to our hands the
                    fealty and homage which he is bound to render and bring to the King at the Castle of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> of Quebec, on account of said fief and seignory; the which fealty and homage we have
                    received, and do receive by these presents, saving the rights of the King in one thing and another
                    in all respects; and the said plaintiff has made and subscribed the oath at our hands to well and
                    faithfully serve His Majesty, and to inform us and our successors if he apprehends that anything
                    works against his service, and he is obliged to furnish his acknowledgement and enumeration in the
                    time prescribed by the laws and customs and usages of this province. Of which and of all he has
                    prayed of us a deed, which we have accorded, and he has signed with us.</p>

                    delayed, after the orders for it in 1726. But probably the greatest interest will be found in the

            <p>P<hi rend="sc">ARKE</hi> county, possibly because its history possesses no intensely dramatic phases,
                    has never figured prominently in the writing of Indiana history. Its settlers were attracted
                    principally by the opportunity to be found in territory newly opened to settlers, and somewhat by
                    the facilities for trade and communication offered by the <geogName>Wabash river</geogName>, Sugar
                    and Caccoon creeks. Its history is simply that of the transition of a mighty forest into a
                    prosperous agricultural region, full of interest, but almost entirely devoid of thrills or
                    sensation. Only one complete history of the county has been written, that of the late John H.
                    Beadle, published in 1880. It is a scholarly, well-written book, though now somewhat out of date.
                    Gen. W. H. H. Beadle and Capt. John T. Campbell, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, have contributed to newspapers many valuable articles dealing with various subjects of
                    Parke county history; and the writer has drawn frequently from material used in articles he himself
                    has written, published in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockville</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Tribune.</hi> This material was gathered almost exclusively from interviews with old
                    settlers. Some of the material which they furnished him is here used for the first time.</p>
            <p>Parke county is primarily an agricultural county. The broad <geogName>Wabash valley</geogName> and
                    the valleys of Sugar creek, Big Raccoon and their tributaries contain land of great fertility, and
                    splendid grazing facilities are offered by the parts of the county still timbered. Coal is the only
                    mineral resource of the county. Its Indian inhabitants were the Wea, Miami and Piankeshaw tribes,
                    while some French pioneers, principally coureurs de bois, settled along the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> and along Sugar creek. In the <hi rend="i">Jesuit Relations</hi> for 1718 appears an
                    account of the visit of a young Frenchman to a village on Pun-ge-se-co-ne, (Sugar creek, literally
                    translated Water-of-many-sugar-trees.) These early French settlers acquired a prosperous trade from
                    the abundance of fur-bearing animals in the county, and many of them married squaws. The
                    "ten o'clock line" south of which, according to treaty, the whites
                    should be allowed to <pb n="145" id="VAA4025-012-2-051"/> settle, ran from the mouth of Big Raccoon,
                    along the line of the ten o'clock sun, to the corner of the old reservation on
                        <geogName>White river</geogName>. More Indian troubles followed, and the battle of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName> followed, November 5, 1811.</p>
            <p>Harrison's army marched through what is now Parke county. It crossed Big Raccoon where the
                    town of Armiesburg now stands, and the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> at the present site of Montezuma. No settlements were made in the county until about
                    1817, and none that resulted in the formation of a town until the settlement of Roseville in 1819.
                    Chauncey Rose was the most prominent citizen of this town. Its industries were three–a
                    store, a grist-mill, and a distillery. Within six years, four other towns had been established,
                    Armiesburg (1820), Portland Mills (1825), both on Big Raccoon, Montezuma (1823), on the
                        <geogName>Wabash river</geogName>, and <placeName>

                    and the Carolinas about 1820-30, forced many of the smaller planters and non-slaveholding whites to
                    seek new homes, the majority of the Parke county pioneers can thus be accounted for. However, many
                    came from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> along with the westward movement of population. Most of the southerners came by way of
                    the <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Charlestown</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Greencastle</settlement>
                    </placeName> trail. The settlers from the east came later by the National Road, and through the
                    woods to their new homes. Parke county was incorporated as a county in 1824, being named after
                    Benjamin Parke.</p>
            <p>The early settlers entered large claims at the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crawfordsville</settlement>
                    </placeName> land office. Settlement at first followed the streams, and practically the whole county
                    was settled by 1845. John H. Beadle records that the last time an Indian was ever seen wild in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Parke county</region>
                    </placeName> was in 1856'.</p>
            <p>Though they naturally suffered hardships, the Parke county pioneers never suffered from cold or
                    hunger. Game abounded in the county and the abundance of fur-bearing animals and wood
                    made' any suffering from the cold unnecessary. The pioneers raised chiefly corn, and this
                    they took on horseback, in ox carts or row boats to the most convenient grist-mill. They lived far
                    apart, but came together at social or religious meetings.</p>
            <p>Rattlesnakes and sickness were the chief woes in early times. The former were exterminated when the
                    thickets were cleared, but the latter continued till recent years. Parke county is very rough <pb n="146" id="VAA4025-012-2-052"/> and broken, and in pioneer times contained many stagnant ponds
                    and swamps. "By following the windings of the low-land in some seasons," says John
                    H. Beadle, "a goose could swim across a township." Malaria, chills and fever were
                    common, and six doctors were kept busy during the malaria season in one small community. Travelers
                    of eighty years ago tell of going along Big Raccoon for miles, and not; finding a family free from
                    sickness. Dr. B. E. Hudson, of Montezuma, who has been practicing medicine there for fifty-seven
                    years, recalls very vividly his experiences. "A man was not a good citizen in those
                    days," he says, "who did not have the chills and fever. I have come home from a
                    hard day's work among people afflicted with it only to find my wife and daughter
                    affllicted with it also."</p>
            <p>The old theory was that a kind of poisonous gas was exhaled from the first turning up of the virgin
                    soil, which contaminated the air. Not until about forty years ago was the trouble located in the
                    swamps and ponds, and when these were drained, the annual epidemics almost entirely disappeared.</p>
            <p>The <geogName>Wabash river</geogName> and its tributaries were the earliest means of communication
                    and commercial intercourse between Parke county and other sections. Pioneers hauled wheat to
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
               </placeName> or <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, sold it for 60 cents a bushel, and hauled back merchandise. Flatboats were sent to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> loaded with farm products. Pork packing was probably the chief industry of the pioneer
                    river towns, and later of the canal towns. Prices were quite different eighty years ago from now.
                    "About 1830, Patterson, Silliman and Company established a store at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Armiesburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and on the original price list we find salt $7 per barrel and calico 35 to
                    40 cents per yard. But pork was sold for $1.50 a hundred, and two sleek, appetizing
                    200-pound porkers might be purchased for $6."</p>
            <p>With the building of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> and Erie canal, 1844-47, and the building of the old east and west plank road about the
                    same time, business in the county took a boom. The canal went through Lodi (Waterman), Montezuma and
                    Armiesburg, and Howard, West Union and Clinton Lock (Lyford) grew up on its banks. All did a
                    thriving business in packing, shipping and importing. Most of the goods for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Putnam</settlement>
                    </placeName>, as well as Parke county, came to these towns. Passenger boats, as well as freight
                    boats, were run on the canal, and much traveling was done in this way. Various social <pb n="147" id="VAA4025-012-2-053"/> gatherings, especially dances, were given on canal boats, as they went
                    up and down the canal. It began to decline about 1855, when it failed to meet the competition of the
                    railroads. Most of the canal bed and the remains of the aqueducts across Big Raccoon and Sugar creek
                    are still visible, and a section of the old tow path forms part of the gravel road between Montezuma
                    and West Union.</p>
            <p>The first railroad ever built through Parke county was the old <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
               </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in 1856. The line was built to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crawfordsville</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1873, and later to <placeName>

                    </placeName>, and is now a part of the Vandalia system. The <placeName>

                    Southwestern was surveyed through the county in 1853, though when the road was built, in 1873, a
                    different route was followed.</p>
            <p>About forty years ago coal companies were organized and the industry was well on its feet in a few
                    years. The town of Nyes-ville, northeast of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, has grown up entirely through coal mining, though it was formerly much larger than
                    now. This is also true of the once flourishing town of Minshall, in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Raccoon</settlement>
                    </placeName> township. Among active mining towns of the county are Rosedale, Roseville and Lyford,

                        <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>

                        <settlement type="city">Raccoon</settlement>
                    </placeName> township. The <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Parke County</region>
                    </placeName> Coal Company was incorporated at Rosedale about twenty years ago, and has developed the

                        <settlement type="city">Otter Creek</settlement>
                    </placeName> township, Vigo county. This company has operated twelve mines in all, and the man to
                    whom chief credit for its success is due is the late Joseph Martin, of Rosedale, for years its
                    president and largest stockholder.</p>
            <p>Factories in the county have never been numerous, and such as have existed have not been of gigantic
                    proportions. A woolen mill was run from 1864 to 1875 in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockville</settlement>
                    </placeName> by J. M. Nichols and W-M. Thompson, a stave factory from 1870 to 1872 by William Ten
                    Brook, and a carding mill in the days before the war. A series of disastrous fires consumed the
                    stave factory and most of the business houses of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockville</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the years 1870-74, but the town long ago recovered from the loss. However, the
                    financial stringency following these fires had much to do with keeping away factories. The abundance
                    of wheat and timber in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Parke county</region>
                    </placeName> support a large number of flouring and saw mills, and several grain elevators. A large
                    factory for the manufacture of pottery, established at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Annapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> more than forty years ago, is run today by R. G. Atcheson, <pb n="148" id="VAA4025-012-2-054"/> son of its founder. McCune and Batman had a woolen mill at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mecca</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the ante-bellum days, and at one time paid 90 cents a pound for wool. Among later
                    industries are the Marion Brick and Tile works, near Montezuma, the Dee clay works at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mecca</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the glass factory near Roseville, the canning factory at <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Catholic missionaries visited Parke county in the days of the French regime. The first Protestant
                    preacher was Rev. Isaac McCoy, who founded an Indian school, but met strong opposition from the
                    Catholic half-breeds of the county. The first organized church in the county was old <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Shiloh</settlement>
                    </placeName> (Presbyterian) about four miles northeast of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. This church was founded in 1822 by Rev. Charles Beatty, and grew so rapidly that in
                    1832 there were enough members living in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockville</settlement>
                    </placeName> to form a church, so they withdrew in that year. The church they founded at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockville</settlement>
                    </placeName> still exists, though separated into two congregations from 1839 to 1869 on account of
                    doctrinal differences. Revs. William Cravens and William Smith preached Methodism in the county from
                    the earliest times, and a church was organized at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockville</settlement>
                    </placeName> about 1826. The Indiana conference met in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockville</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1838, presided over by Bishop Soule. Over one hundred preachers came, by river,
                    stage or on horseback, ministers and horses being cared for free of charge during their stay.
                    Lorenzo Dow and Robert R. Roberts were among the eminent Methodist preachers who visited pioneer <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In later years, Dr. Lyman Abbott, then a pastor at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>, frequently preached at the Presbyterian church.</p>
            <p>The Friends settled in the northwestern part of the county and established a church at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomingdale</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1826. The Baptists also appeared at an early day and built a brick church in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Some smaller sects took root in the county, such as Associate Presbyterians
                    (Seceders), Christians, United Brethren, Cumberland Presbyterians and Lutherans. Among pioneer
                    preachers of these sects, Doctor Dixon, of the Seceders, and Doctor Rudisill, of the Lutherans, were
                    noted over Indiana for their learning. The Roman Catholics founded a church at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockville</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1854, where Bishop H. J. Alerding, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>, was one-time parish priest.</p>
            <p>The Parke county pioneers were usually religious, and revivals, camp meetings, and meetings for
                    doctrinal debates were very common. In spite of the high degree of fervor aroused, these services
                    seldom witnessed any abnormal religious manifestations.</p>
            <pb n="149" id="VAA4025-012-2-055"/>
            <p>Log schools were established in the county in the earliest times, and a brick school house was built
                    in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockville</settlement>
                    </placeName> about 1830. The teachers knew the rudiments of the three R's and nothing
                    more. School government was an athletocracy. The school code was as complex as the law of contracts
                    and as rigid as that of Draco. An unsuccessful effort was made to get Asbury College (now DePauw
                    University) located at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockville</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1837. Though this resulted in failure it caused an educational awakening in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. For the next twenty years many select schools and a female seminary flourished. The
                    Parke county seminary was founded in 1839. This became <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockville</settlement>
                    </placeName> high school in 1872 and was commissioned a few years ago. The Friends were zealous for
                    education, and founded the Western Manual Labor Institute at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomingdale</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1846; it soon became Bloomingdale academy and still exists in a prosperous
                    condition. It was famous under the superintendency of the late Barnabas C. Hobbs, who also did much
                    to develop the common schools of the county by his normal training classes.</p>
            <p>Few counties in Indiana experienced more stormy times during the Civil War than did Parke. The Peace
                    Democrats were very strong and at times menacing. They were led by Hon. John C. Davis and other men
                    of marked ability. Many trivial events gave rise to shooting affrays, and in the northern part of
                    the county, civil war was threatened. Even today we hear of the "Battle of
                    McCoy's Bluffs," or the "charge on Thompson's
                    hen-roosts." One company from Parke county, was sent out under the first call for troops,
                    serving in the 11th Indiana. Parke county furnished the first company to the first three year
                    regiments sent out from the state–Company A, 14th Indiana. The county also furnished
                    companies to the 31st, 21st, 43rd and 85th Infantry, the 6th and 11th Cavalry and the 9th Battery,
                    of the three year service; and to five short term regiments, the 78th, 115th, 133rd, 137th, and
                    149th. The county sent out about 2,000 soldiers in all–about one-eighth of the entire
                    population of a county in which a large portion of the inhabitants were actively or passively
                    opposed to the subjugation of the South. Ladies' Aid societies existed in every township,
                    and regularly furnished their contributions to the soldiers.</p>
            <p>Parke county has produced a number of noted people, among them Gen. Tilghman A. Howard, congressman

            <p>Parke county was created by act of the legislature, approved January 9, 1821, and the governor
                    appointed the following officers to serve until an election could be held: Captain Andrew Brooks,
                    sheriff; James Blair, coroner; Wallace Rea, clerk and recorder; Dempsey Seybold and Joseph Ralston,
                    justices, and Stephen Collett, surveyor. The election was held the first Monday in August, 1821, the
                    poll being at the home of Richard Henry, just north of the Vigo county line. The Jackson men cast a
                    majority of the votes, of which there were seventy; drinking and a fight between two of the election
                    officials followed. It was then considered dishonorable to complain of a man and have him fined for
                    fighting on election day or muster day; so all the accumulated quarrels of a year or two were then
                    and there settled, and the books squared.</p>
            <p>In its early period, Parke county, like most frontier localities of that day, was strong for Andrew
                    Jackson and his faction. Most of the few <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> men in the county were settlers from <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">New England</settlement>
                    </placeName>. However, about 1826-'30 came a great migration of Quakers and small
                    plantation owners from the Carolinas, most of whom were Whigs. This addition to the Whig vote gave
                    them a fair majority over the Democrats, and Parke county most of the time since has returned Whig
                    or Republican majorities. The strength of parties in various localities of the county is very much
                    as it was in pioneer days. Liberty and Penn townships have always returned great Whig and Republican
                    majorities. Only once, in 1906, did a Democrat carry Penn township. Reserve and Jackson townships,
                    largely settled by Kentuckians and Virginians, who favored low tariff and opposed the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> bank, have been strongly Democratic from earliest times. The early Whig and Republican
                    domination was so strong that no Democratic newspaper ever succeeded in the county until after the
                    Civil War, though the <placeName>

                    1854, but its name was changed shortly to Penn township. Sugar Creek township was divided in 1855,
                    and the eastern portion was called Howard township. These thirteen townships compose the county as
                    it is at present.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Rockville</settlement>

                    </placeName>. The regular circuit judge usually presided part of the time at court and the rest of
                    the time court was in charge of associate judges, who generally were respected men of the community,
                    but who usually knew little of the law. Few of the county officials prior to 1850 were men of
                    education. For years it was the custom to elect a coroner from among the stalwart blacksmiths of the
                    county, and Randall H. Burks, Solomon Pinegar and Johnson S. White were among the pioneer
                    blacksmiths to hold this office. The office of sheriff was considered very desirable, and among
                    antebellum political leaders and men of ability who served as sheriff we find William T. Noel,
                    Austin M. (<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mtu">Montana</region>
                    </placeName>) Puett, James W. Beadle, and David Kirkpatrick. The first cases tried in the county
                    were for petit larceny, gambling and selling liquor without a license. No famous trial occurred
                    until that of Noah Beauchamp for murder in 1841. Beauchamp was a blacksmith of Vigo county, a good
                    citizen, but a man of hot temper and a family pride that was almost a mania. As a result of a charge
                    that his daughter had stolen some goods from a neighbor's family, Beauchamp became almost
                    insanely angry, and the result was a quarrel and a murder. The case was venued to Parke county, and
                    a memorable trial followed, in which "Ned" McGaughey prosecuted and Tilghman A.
                    Howard represented Beauchamp, and the result was conviction with a death penalty. An appeal to the
                    supreme court and even to the governor failed, and Beauchamp was hanged in November, 1841, on a
                    hill-side about a mile east of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Only one other man has ever been hanged in the county, "Buck" Stout,
                    who committed a murder in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Montgomery county</region>
                    </placeName> in 1884, and whose case was venued to Parke county.</p>

            <p>Parke was originally paired with Vigo county in the election of a representative, but in 1826 was
                    created an independent district. This continued until this present year, when Parke and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fountain</region>
                    </placeName> counties were paired. The county early was joined with <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Vermillion</region>
                    </placeName> as a member of the 47th judicial circuit of Indiana, and this continued until the
                    present year, when, by act of legislature, the counties were given separate circuits.</p>
            <p>From 1825-50 was an age of extensive internal improvements all over the county, and Parke county
                    became involved in the general plan. When the national road was surveyed in 1827, one set of
                    surveyors reported a route across Parke county, crossing the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>

                        <settlement type="city">Clinton</settlement>
                    </placeName>. However, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> had a representative in Congress, and he succeeded in having the route built through
                    the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Prairie City</settlement>
                    </placeName>. As early as 1825 the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> and Erie canal was a local issue in the county, and in that year Joseph M. Hayes, of
                    Montezuma, announced himself for the legislature, making the canal his chief issue. It continued a
                    vital issue in the county until it was finally built. The county was well enough settled to feel the
                    effects of the panic of 1837, and from thenceforward national issues are most prominent in campaigns
                    of the county. The Whigs used their "log cabin and hard cider" propaganda with
                    complete success, so far as Parke county was concerned, in the campaign of 1840.</p>
            <p>The campaign of 1844 was one of the most bitter and strenuous ever waged in the county. Political
                    activity began in 1843 with the gubernatorial and senatorial elections. E. W. McGaughey, Whig, and
                    Joseph A. Wright, Democrat, both of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, were the opposing candidates for congress, and both made stump speeches at almost
                    every town, cross roads and school house in the county. The <hi rend="i">Olive Branch,</hi> the Whig
                    organ, was a typical pioneer political "sheet," more noted for calumny and rabid
                    partisanship than for news sense and correct use of the King's English. During the
                    campaign it abounded in such expressions as these: "Infidel dog, who thus dares to open his
                    God-defying lips," "locofoco," "sneak," "wily
                    Joe (Joseph A. Wright)" and "tricky Austin (Austin M. Puett)". The Whigs
                    carried Parke county, but the State went Democratic, and Wright carried the district by just three
                    votes–this was especially humiliating to the Parke county Whigs, as "Little
                    Ned" ran far below his ticket in the county. (He was elected two years later.) The editor
                    of the <hi rend="i">Olive Branch</hi> offered excuses, and announced: "No paper will be
                    issued from this office <pb n="153" id="VAA4025-012-2-059"/> for three or four weeks, as the editor
                    must go out and collect what is due him." <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> clubs sprang up all over the county early in 1844, the Democrats soon manifested
                    similar activity, and by fall politics had transcended business in importance. Citizens of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockville</settlement>
                    </placeName> remember a wagon and team of oxen coming to town from the northern part of the county,
                    the wagon and horns of the oxen being adorned with polk berries. Polk-stalks and roosters were
                    Democratic, and 'coon skins and poplar boughs Republican emblems. "Argument was
                    completely abandoned. In its stead was abuse of the opposing party, vile caricatures of its
                    candidates, obscene and foolish song, with sarcasm, clamor and confusion."</p>
            <p>Campaigns continued to be heated, but the issue gradually changed from "finance" to
                    "slavery," and on this issue the Whigs maintained a strong plurality in the
                    county. The "underground railroad" ran through Parke county, and a
                    "station" was established in a barn about a mile east of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Annapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Many of the Carolina settlers of Parke county were Democrats and many of them carried the southern
                    viewpoint with them to the north. Other Democrats believed that the war was wrong on principle, and
                    that it was wrong to subdue the South. These two refractory elements of population, quite numerous
                    for a county the size of Parke, were always threatening and at times turbulent, until the end of the
                    war. The bitter feeling engendered by this conflict figured strongly in the political campaigns of
                    the next twenty-five years, and has not died out entirely even today. The Knights of the Golden
                    Circle, later called the Sons of Liberty, had a very large organization in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, at the head of which were Hon. John G. Davis and Dr. H. J. Rice. Both were speakers of
                    ability, and made many speeches denouncing this "unholy, fratricidal strife." Mr.
                    Davis spoke in all parts of the county in behalf of the Peace Democracy. The <hi rend="i">
                  <placeName>
                            <region type="county">Parke County</region>
                        </placeName> Republican</hi> viciously attacked him; its editor, Madison Keeney, was a man of
                    undoubted courage, much ability and zealous patriotism, but his attacks were as vicious as they were
                    fearless. His aptitude for strong language and acrid repartee especially angered the Peace
                    Democracy. Mr. Davis called the <hi rend="i">Republican</hi> a "smut machine," and
                    Mr. Keeney replied: "Smut machines has two definitions—agricultural, a machine
                    for separating the grains of wheat from the dirt, the chaff and the cheat; political, a paper for
                    separating the good and true men from ditto. We accept the designation." The
                    editor's life and property were threatened, <pb n="154" id="VAA4025-012-2-060"/> but he
                    refused to retract anything he had said, "even though all the people of Parke county were
                    against him." Local speakers, notably Thomas N. Rice, a prominent attorney, spoke
                    vigorously against the Peace Democracy upon various occasions, and in August, 1861, Governor Morton
                    spoke in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Contemporary estimates of the crowd that heard him, doubtless greatly exaggerated,
                    place it at 5,000 people. He discussed the issues of the war and then turned to the
                    "Copperheads":</p>
            <p>"Let them beware, vigilant men watch them, and the moment they transgress the limits of the
                    law, they will be summarily punished." This warning became perverted, as was to be expected
                    in such strenuous times, and John G. Davis, in subsequent speeches, spoke of the "sneaking
                    administration that sets a vigilance committee secretly to watch men who merely express their honest
                    convictions."</p>
            <p>John G. Davis, once one of the most popular and esteemed men in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, became the most hated, at least so far as the Union people were concerned. Things
                    continued in this state for many months, and a Union mass meeting was called. The meeting
                    unanimously decided that John G. Davis should be killed, but one man, a little more far-sighted than
                    the others, asked, "Whom shall we appoint to kill him?" Thereupon the meeting got
                    "cold feet." No one wanted the task, and Mr. Davis continued to live and make
                    speeches. Daniel W. Voorhees spoke several times in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockville</settlement>
                    </placeName> during the war; the Peace Democracy considered his speeches examples of almost
                    infallible logic, while the succeeding issues of the <hi rend="i">Republican</hi> gave him a severe
                    grilling.</p>
            <p>The smoldering hatred of the two factions resulted in a shooting affray in <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName>, and an apparently harmless remark made by one of them about Marshal James K. Meacham,
                    a loyal Union man, was enlarged upon and carried to Mr. Meacham in the form of a challenge. The
                    result was that the marshal and his supposed challenger started a fight with pistols on the public
                    square of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and were joined by others, so that the affair became a miniature battle. However, the
                    heat of the conflict was in inverse proportion to the accuracy of the firing, for no one was killed
                    or seriously wounded.</p>
            <p>The anti-war party was successful in the elections of 1862, but was defeated in those of 1863.
                    Accordingly, while affairs were comparatively <pb n="155" id="VAA4025-012-2-061"/> quiet during
                    1863, trouble was started again in 1864. The Butternut building, referred to elsewhere, became an
                    object of strong suspicion, and it was said with more or less truth that the Peace Democrats were
                    drilling in this building. All kinds of insurrection rumors were afloat, and some Union men even
                    went so far as to threaten Dr. Rice's life and property in case of open violence. The <hi rend="i">Republican</hi> became full of talk about "traitors,"
                    "suspicious looking characters," "secret drillings,"
                    "hundreds of desperate, villainous looking strangers" and the like. "It
                    were a wearisome task," says John H. Beadle, "to recount all the rumors of
                    trouble, the neighborhood quarrels, the fist fights, threats and recriminations." Only in
                    Sugar Creek and Howard townships, however, was there any organized attempt at violence. These
                    townships contain many hills and hollows and were still in the rude, pioneer state at the outbreak
                    of the war. Sentiment was about evenly divided on the question of the Union.</p>
            <p>A general raid was made, late in 1864, on the Union men of Howard township, with the intention of
                    disarming them. George Lay, an aged engineer who had served on the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                    </placeName> &amp; <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> thirty years before and who later settled on a farm in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Howard</settlement>
                    </placeName> township, proved the La Tour d'Auvergne of the locality. When about thirty
                    anti-war men raided his home at night, he rose and met them undauntedly with a corn cutter. He
                    wounded two of them, one mortally, and his wife blew a blast on the dinner horn to arouse the
                    neighbors, and the raiders fled, one accidently shooting himself fatally while climbing a fence in
                    haste. Mr. Lay himself was wounded, but not seriously. The home guards, consisting of a company from
                    nearly every township in the county, all under the command of Col. Caspar Budd, of Howard, was
                    called out, and the hills and vales of Sugar Creek and Howard townships were raided. Much excitement
                    was aroused, but the Peace Democracy had subsided, and no fighting occurred.</p>
            <p>A great sensation was aroused in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockville</settlement>
                    </placeName> the same summer by what may be called the Beaubien incident. Rev. J. C. B. Beaubien was
                    pastor of the First, or Old School, Presbyterian church of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, at the time, and made an apparently professional visit to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. After his return a letter was found, purporting to be from prominent Knights of the
                    Golden Circle in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockville</settlement>
                    </placeName> to their brethren in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The missive gave instructions for the sending of arms and ammunition to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockville</settlement>
                    </placeName> branch of the <pb n="156" id="VAA4025-012-2-062"/> order, in care of Mr. Beaubien. The
                    letter was printed in the <hi rend="i">

                        </placeName> Republican,</hi> and made the subject of long and venomous editorial comment in
                    several issues. Whether or not the letter was authentic, it was taken at full value in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockville</settlement>
                    </placeName>; Mr. Beaubien, though known previously as a man of high character and considerable
                    ability, found himself deserted in wrath by most of his congregation, and publicly denounced by men
                    who had been his most active members. He professed no connection with the K. G. C, and avowed his
                    loyalty to the Union, but the people refused to believe in his sincerity, and he finally resigned in
                    November, 1864.</p>
            <p>By the campaign of 1864, the Republicans and War Democrats had been fused into the Union party, and
                    carried Parke county that year by a large majority. Candidates for theiUnion nomination for office
                    were numerous, and there were no less than nine for sheriff. The convention nominated principally
                    ex-Union soldiers, and the War Democrats were greatly peeved over the nomination of a young Union
                    soldier for commissioner, over Judge Walter Danaldson, one of the most prominent citizens of
                    Montezuma. They had the following notice published in the <hi rend="i">Republican,</hi> and carried
                    it out, though without success and against the protest of Judge Danaldson himself: "We, the
                    War Democrats of Parke county, intend to run Judge Danaldson as our candidate for county
                    commissioner, whether he is willing or not."</p>
            <p>One unfortunate class living in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockville</settlement>
                    </placeName> during the Civil War was the class of people who came from the South, and who, although
                    they believed in the righteousness of the Union cause, were too devoted "to the home of
                    their childhood and the traditions of their people" to support it actively. Their practical
                    neutrality was regarded as an evidence of treason, and they were called "traitors"
                    and "Copperheads" by the radical Unionists, and socially ostracised. Notable among
                    these people was the Rev. Samuel H. McNutt, a Presbyterian minister of talent and most lovable
                    character. Some <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> and Carolina families were looked upon with suspicion because of their Southern origin,
                    even though their sons fought with gallantry in the Union army.</p>
            <p>The antipathy for the men who opposed the war or actually sympathised with the South remained very
                    bitter for years after the war, and has not yet completely subsided. "Copperhead,"
                    "traitor," "rebel," "Knight of the Golden
                    Circle," were employed for years by the Republicans in campaigns. This was especially true
                    in the bitter <pb n="157" id="VAA4025-012-2-063"/> campaign of 1876. As a typical incident, a highly
                    respected Reserve township Democrat had been selected as the party's choice for
                    representative, and his prospects were seriously hurt by a communication to the <hi rend="i">Republican</hi> to the effect that during the war he had refused a Union soldier refreshment.
                    According to the communication, he said that he cared nothing for the soldiers or the cause for
                    which they were fighting. He replied with a communication, professing esteem for the soldiers of the
                    Union, and speaking of various relatives who had served in the Civil War. However, as he and several
                    brothers were of military age during the war, and none served in the army, the first communication
                    was generally believed, and the candidate failed of election. In the deadlock following the election
                    of 1876, feeling was exceedingly tense. Democratic meetings denounced in severest terms Senator
                    Morton, as well as "Republican treachery," and "narrow, unreasonable war
                    prejudices."</p>

                    twelve north and range nine west, with eleven other parcels of land in what afterward became Vigo

                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and was formally opened to entry and settlement by the proclamation of President

                    </placeName> on the second Monday in September following and for three succeeding weeks.</p>
            <p>Another proclamation of the same date allowed entries by the Canadian Volunteers, under the Act of

                    </placeName>, who entered into an agreement dated September 19, 1816, whereby the thirteen tracts
                    were apportioned into twelve equal and undivided shares of which the Bullitts were the owners of
                    two, Lindley four, Markle three and Laselle three. Further, in order that the payments for the land
                    might be regularly made, they agreed that immediately on the execution of the agreement they would
                    pay one-fourth of the purchase money, to wit: the sum of $7,594.07 into the office of the
                    receiver of public monies at <placeName>

                    $1,898.85 by Markle and $1,898.85 by Laselle. A like amount was to be paid on
                    or before the first of August in 1818, 1819 and 1820, and a default by any of the parties should
                    forfeit his interest in the venture. They further agreed to make such disposition of <pb n="159" id="VAA4025-012-2-065"/> the lands as they might deem most advisable as soon as they
                    conveniently could, arranged for a division of the profits on the first of June, 1818, and on the
                    first of October of each year thereafter, and that any remaining unsold lands should be advertised
                    July 1, 1821, and sold on the first of the following October with a final settlement of the proceeds
                    in money, notes, bonds, dues and demands following such sale.</p>
            <p>On this same date a power of attorney was given "our trusty friend, Joseph Kitchell,
                    authorizing him to take possession of the lands and to lay out in town lots, in and out, such part
                    thereof" as they or any three of them might direct. In accord with this plan Kitchell filed
                    for record at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> October 25, 1816, the plan of the future town, comprising 268 lots, a public square and
                    two double-sized lots which were reserved for a church and school.</p>
            <p>On the day following this agreement Major Markle sold to Eliakim Crosby, Eleazar Aspinwall and Harlow
                    &amp; Trimble three-quarters of his interest; September 25, Lindley sold seven-eighths of his
                    interest to Joseph Kitchell, David Raymond, Henry Speed, William Hoggatt, Jonathan Lyons, John
                    DePauw, and John Owens, while three days later, September 28, Laselle partitioned his three shares
                    into twenty parts and sold portions to Truman Blackman, John Goodwin, Joseph Warner, Caleb Crawford,
                    Andrew Himrod, M. and H. Recherville, Michel Broulliette, Pierre Broulliette, Modeset &amp;
                    Shields, John Dunn, Robert Harrison, John Carr, John R. Holloway, Charles Thompson, John Andrews,
                    Pierre Laplante and John Long. Here we have within ten days of the agreement of the five men, and
                    before a stake had been driven on the plat, thirty-five part owners.</p>
            <p>The first sale of lots took place October 31, 1816, and the <hi rend="i">Western Sun,</hi> of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, said, November 9, that upwards of twenty-one thousand dollars worth were sold the
                    first day. Many of these sales, if not all of them, were on credit, the larger part of them did not
                    stay sold and for some time to come the stakes of the surveyor were the only evidences of the town
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>. It is true that six houses were built that fall and winter but at the time of the
                    location of the county seat, in the spring of 1818, the owners were still able to donate forty-eight
                    of the lots to the county as part payment for the location. We may be sure, too, that they did not
                    give away all the lots that they owned at this time.</p>
            <p>B. Johnson, sheriff of Sullivan county, advertised to be sold for <pb n="160" id="VAA4025-012-2-066"/> taxes sixty lots that were not highly valued, in the <hi rend="i">Western Sun</hi> of November
                    22, 1817, which would look like quick action on his part, for the patent was not yet issued for the
                    land.</p>
            <p>Within the company, many sales took place, for on April 16, 1817, John Holloway sold to Wilson and
                    Pocock, Wilson assigning his interest to Pocock but acquiring, May 23, the interest of John Long;
                    Eliakim Crosby sold to William Harlow, October 31; Henry Speed sold to the Bullitts, July 3, 1818;
                    July 13, John Carr sold to Charles Smith; the next day Smith bought of John Dunn; October 3, Abraham
                    Markle sold his remaining interest to Eleazar Aspin-wall, this sale later confusing affairs for the
                    company; October 15, John Owens sold to the Bullitts; June 28, 1819, Joseph Kitchell sold to
                    Jonathan Lindley; October 23, Harlow sold his half interest in Harlow &amp; Trimble's
                    purchase to John Sheets. December 22, Thomas Bullitt sold to his brother Cuthbert the portion they
                    had bought of Henry Speed and John Owens. June 6, 1820, Harlow sold his interest as the surviving
                    partner of Harlow &amp; Trimble to Gorham A. Worth of the Bank of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, this being a deed of trust to secure the payment of a noifi for $6,300.00,
                    which was evidently paid, for he again sold this shaft to John Sheets, January 30, 1821.</p>
            <p>Meantime John Badollet, register of the land office at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, issued October 17, 1820, his certificate showing payment in full to have been made for
                    the land on which the town was located.</p>
            <p>Eleazar Aspinwall, who had bought out Abraham Markle, died in November of 1820, and, as his estate
                    was believed to be insolvent and the company was in doubt to whom his interest was payable, his
                    heirs gave a power of attorney to William C. Linton, August 31, 1821, under which he made a trust
                    deed April 16, 1822, to Moses Hoggatt and Robert Sturgus, trustees under a deed of September 29,
                    1821, whereupon the trustees proceeded to execute deeds to the purchasers, many of whom had long
                    before paid for their lots and had erected thereon houses, shops and stores in which the social and
                    business life of the future city was beginning to be manifest.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

                    </placeName> having been consummated and certain disputes relative to horse-stealing and other
                    depredations having been arranged between the two races, the governor, on the fourth of October,
                    1809, set out on his return to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He traveled on horse-back, accompanied by his secretary and interpreter, passing
                    through the Indian villages at the forks of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> and striking the towns of the Miamis at the mouth of the Mississinewa. Here dwelt John
                    B. Richardville, or Peshewah, a celebrated chief of that tribe, who was later chosen as principal
                    sachem on the death of Little Turtle. Richardville had not been personally present at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but he now received the governor cordially, and gave his unqualified approval to the
                    previous proceedings.</p>
            <p>The day before his arrival at Peshewah's town, the governor met with a singular
                    experience, which not only served to illustrate the advancing ravages of liquor among the tribes,
                    but Harrison's intimate knowledge of Indian laws, customs and usages. On coming into the
                    camp of Pucan, a Mississinewa chieftain, he discovered that one of the warriors had received a
                    mortal wound during a "drunken frolic" of the preceding evening. The chiefs
                    informed him that the slayer had not been apprehended, whereupon the governor recommended that if
                    the act "should appear to have proceeded from previous malice," that the offender
                    should be punished, "but if it should appear to be altogether accident to let him know it
                    and he would assist to make up the matter with the friends of the deceased."<hi rend="sup">1</hi> This payment of wergild or "blood-money" among the Indian tribes in
                    compensation of the loss of life or limb, is strongly in accord with the ancient Saxon law, yet it
                    seems to have prevailed as far back at least as the time of William Penn, for in one of his letters

                    </placeName>, the governor had another and similar experience which affords additional proof that
                    the custom above mentioned was still prevalent. A Pottawattomie chieftain from the prairies came in
                    attended by some young men. He found there about one hundred and fifty of the Kickapoos, who were
                    receiving their annuity, and he immediately made complaint to the governor as follows: "My
                    father," said he, "it is now twelve moons since these people, the Kickapoos,
                    killed my brother; I have never revenged it, but they have promised to cover up his blood, but they
                    have not done it. I wish you to tell them, my father, to pay me for my brother, or some of them will
                    lose their hair before they go from this." The governor accordingly advised the chief of
                    the Kickapoos to satisfy the Pottawattomie. On the following day the latter again called upon the
                    governor, and said: "See there, my father," showing three blankets and some other
                    articles, "see what these people have offered me for my brother, but my brother was not a
                    hog that I should take three blankets for him," and he declared his intention of killing
                    some of them unless they would satisfy him in the way he proposed. The governor, upon inquiry,
                    finding that the goods of the Kickapoos were all distributed, directed, on account of

            <p>At the villages on <geogName>Eel river</geogName> the governor met with certain of the Weas of the

                    been absent for a period of about six weeks, and found that the complete success of his mission had
                    restored in large measure that popularity which he had beforetime lost on account of his advocacy of
                    slavery. The acquisition was heralded far and wide as a measure calculated in all respects to
                    forward the interests of the Territory. Not only was the total domain acquired, vast in extent and
                    acreage, (being computed at about 2,600,000 acres), but it was considered extremely <list type="footnotes">

                    proximity to the settlements, it was confidently expected that the old clashes would cease and that
                    the new territory would be speedily surveyed and opened up for entry and purchase to within twelve
                    miles of the mouth of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Vermillion</region>
                    </placeName>. The Indians also, seemed well satisfied. The Pottawattomie had been urgent;
                    Richardville, Little Turtle and all the Miamis had given their consent; the Weas and Kickapoos were
                    about to ratify. Nothing was then heard of the pretensions of the Shawnee Prophet or his abler
                    brother. In a message to the territorial legislature in 1810, reviewing the events of this period,
                    Harrison said:</p>
            <p>It was not until eight months after the conclusion of the treaty, and after his design of forming a
                    combination against the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> had been discovered and defeated, that the pretensions of the Prophet, in regard to the
                    land in question, were made known. A furious clamor was then raised by the foreign agents among us,
                    and other disaffected persons, against the policy which had excluded from the treaty this great and
                    influential character, as he is termed, and the doing so expressly attributed to the personal
                    ill-will on the part of the negotiator. No such ill-will did in fact exist. I accuse myself, indeed,
                    of an error in the patronage and support which I afforded him on his arrival on the <placeName>

                    </placeName> had been developed. But on no principle of propriety or policy could he have been made
                    a party to the treaty. The personage, called the Prophet, is not a chief of the tribe to which he
                    belongs, but an outcast from it, rejected and hated by the real chiefs, the principal of whom was
                    present at the treaty, and not only disclaimed on the part of his tribe any title to the lands
                    ceded, but used his personal influence with the chiefs of other tribes to affect the cession.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The "principal chief" of the Shawnees above alluded to was undoubtedly Black Hoof,

                    and tradition says that like Moses, "his eye was not dim; nor his natural force
                    abated." The fact that Black Hoof, who was of great fame among his tribe, as both orator
                    and statesman, made no claim to any of the lands sold below the <placeName>

            <p>The personal admirers and intimate associates of Harrison, were, of course, overjoyed. They were no
                    doubt influenced to some extent by the fact that another long lease of power was in sight. Their
                    leader's victory would inure to their own benefit. Still, there were no cravens among
                    them. A banquet followed, participated in by a number of the leading citizens of the town and
                    adjacent country. Judge Henry Vanderburgh, of the Territorial Court, presided, and toasts were drunk
                    to the treaty, Governor Harrison, his secretary Peter Jones, and "the honest
                    interpreter," Joseph Barron. Of those present on that occasion, some were afterwards

            </p>
            <p>There were those, however, who were not to be silenced by the governor's triumph. The
                    political battles of that time were extremely vitriolic, and the fights over territorial politics
                    had been filled with hate. Certain foes of the governor not only appeared in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox county</region>
                    </placeName>, but eventually in the halls of the National Congress, and there were those who did not
                    hesitate to question the governor's integrity. Among those who bitterly opposed Harrison
                    was one William McIntosh, " a Scotchman of large property at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, who had been for many years hostile to the governor, and who was not believed to be

                    the year 1805, McIntosh had been upon good terms with Harrison, but that Harrison's
                    advocacy of a representative government for the Territory, or its advancement to the second grade,
                    had turned him into an enemy. However this may be, Harrison and his friends, in order to vindicate

                    </placeName>." The suit being brought to issue, it was found that of the territorial judges
                    then on the bench, one, probably Judge Vanderburgh, was a personal friend of the
                    governor's, and one a personal friend of McIntosh. These gentlemen, therefore, both
                    retired, and the Honorable Waller Taylor, who had recently come into the territory, assumed the
                    ermine. A jury was selected by the court naming two elisors, who in turn selected a panel of
                    forty-eight persons, from which the plaintiff and defendant each struck twelve, and from the
                    remaining twenty-four the jury was drawn by lot. With this "struck jury" the cause
                    proceeded to a hearing. The following account, given in <hi rend="i">Dawson's

            <p>Before a crowded audience, this interesting trial was continued from 10 a. m. till one
                    o'clock at night. Every person concerned in the Indian Department, or who could know

                    the examination permitted. Finding that the testimony of all the witnesses went to prove the justice
                    and integrity of the governor's conduct in relation to everything connected with the
                    Indian Department, the defendant began to ask questions relating to some points of his civil
                    administration. To this the jury as well as the court objected, the latter observing that It was
                    necessary that the examination should be confined to the matter at issue. But at the earnest request
                    of the governor the defendant was permitted to pursue his own course and examine the witnesses upon
                    every point which he might think proper. The defendant's counsel abandoning all idea of
                    justification, pleaded only for a mitigation of damages. After a retirement of one hour the jury
                    returned a verdict of $4,000 damages. To pay this sum, a large amount of the
                    defendant's lands were exposed for sale, and in the governor's absence in the
                    command of the army the ensuing year, was bought in by his agent. Two-thirds of his property has
                    since been returned to McIntosh and the remaining part given to some of of the orphan children of

                    disobeyed. He was glad to find, however, that they were sober, and expressed a wish that they would
                    not drink any more while the deliberations were in progress. On the twenty-fifth he explained fully

                    might be a friend instead of a foe.</p>
            <p>The account related by Simon Kenton, and vouched for by John Johnston and Anthony Shane, is that
                    Tecumseh, Laulewasikaw, the Prophet, and a third brother, Kumskaukau, were triplets; that Tecumseh
                    was the youngest or last born of the three; that "this event so extraordinary among the
                    Indian tribes with whom a double birth is quite uncommon, struck the mind of the people as
                    supernatural, and marked him and his brothers with the prestige of future greatness–that
                    the Great Spirit would direct them to the achievement of something great." The date of this
                    extraordinary event is given by most authors as 1768, making Tecumseh and the Prophet some five
                    years the seniors of General Harrison. "They were born in a cabin or hut, constructed of
                    round saplings chinked with sticks and clay, near the mouth of Stillwater, on the upper part of its
                    junction with the Great Miami, then a pleasant plateau of land, with a field of corn not subject to
                        overflow."<hi rend="sup">10</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of the early life of the Prophet not much is known. "According to one account he was noted
                    in his earlier years for stupidity and intoxication; but one day, while lighting his pipe in his
                    cabin, he fell back apparently lifeless and remained in that condition until his friends had
                    assembled for the funeral, when he revived from his trance, quieted their alarm, and announced that
                    he had been conducted to the spirit world."<hi rend="sup">11</hi> As an orator, he is said
                    to have been even more powerful than Tecumseh himself, and his great influence in after years among
                    the various tribes would seem to bear that statement out. However, he was boastful, arrogant, at
                    times cruel, and never enjoyed the reputation for honesty and integrity that his more distinguished
                    brother did. In personal appearance he was not prepossessing. He had lost one eye, "which
                    defect he concealed by wearing a dark veil or handkerchief over the disfigured organ." It
                    has been related that he was dominated to some extent by his wife, who was regarded by the Squaws at
                    the Prophet's Town as a queen.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>

                    mode of obtaining fire by percussion. He denounced the woolen stuffs as not equal to skins for
                    clothing; he commended the use of the bow and arrow. As to intermarriage between the races, all this
                    was prohibited. The two races were distinct and must remain so. Neither could there be any separate
                    or individual ownership of any of the Indian lands; these were the common heritage of all. The weak,
                    aged and infirm were to be cherished and protected; parental authority was to be obeyed. In
                    conclusion, he never failed to proclaim that the Great Spirit had gifted him with the divine power
                    to "cure all diseases and to arrest the hand of death, in sickness, or on the
                    battlefield."</p>
            <p>The fame of the Prophet soon aroused the jealousy of many of the neighboring chiefs and medicine men.
                    They saw their power dwindling away and their authority diminishing. They took steps to check the
                    advancing tide of fanaticism, but were at once adroitly met by the introduction of an inquisition
                    into witchcraft, which had been almost universally believed in by the tribes, but against which, the
                    Prophet now hurled the most direful anathemas. He declared that any one who dealt in magic or
                    "medicine juggleries" should never taste of future happiness, and must be
                    instantly put to death. His deluded and awe-struck followers promptly began a systematic searching
                    out and persecution of "witches," and all under his personal direction. The finger
                    of the seer often pointed at a prominent warrior or chieftain, or some member of their household.
                    The Prophet's mere denunciation was proof enough. The victim went to the torture of death
                    by fire, or some other fate equally revolting. Among the Delawares, especially, the most shocking
                    cruelty ensued, and finally these things came to the ears of the governor at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He immediately sent a "speech" by special messenger to the headsmen

                    and to drive him out of their midst. In the course of this "speech" he said:
                    "Demand of him some proofs at least of his being the messenger of the Deity. If God has
                    really employed him, He has doubtless authorized him to perform miracles that he may be known and
                    received as a prophet. <pb n="170" id="VAA4025-012-2-076"/> If he is really a prophet, ask of him to

            <p>The language of the Governor proved to be unfortunate. On June 16, 1806, there was a total eclipse of
                    the sun in northern latitudes for a period of about five minutes, at about a half an hour before
                    midday, and this event had long been heralded by the astronomers of that time, and had come to the
                    ears of the Prophet through intercourse with some white friends. The crafty savage was not slow to
                    act. He told his followers that on a certain fixed day, and at a time when the sun was at the height
                    of its power, he would place the same under his feet, and cause darkness to come over the face of
                    the earth. On the day announced the Prophet stood among his fearful band awaiting the hour. The day
                    was wholly clear and without clouds, but at the appointed time the terrified savages saw a disc of
                    blackness gradually pass over the face of the sun; the birds became agitated and flew to cover; the
                    skulking dogs drew near their masters; almost absolute darkness fell on all about; the stars of
                    heaven appeared in the zenith, and in the midst of it all, the Prophet exclaimed: "Did I
                    not testify truly? Behold! Darkness has shrouded the sun."<hi rend="sup">18</hi>
                    The account of that day, faithfully set forth by J. Fenni-more Cooper, then a youth, is filled with
                    strange relations of the unnatural appearance of all earthly things; of the sudden awe and fear that
                    came into the minds of all; how women stood near their husbands in silence and children clung to
                    their mothers in terror, and if these were the emotions experienced in a civilized community, made
                    fully aware of the coming event, what must have been the impression produced on the superstitious
                    mind of the savage, wholly unenlightened in the ways of science? From that day, the power of the
                    savage Prophet was secure until the spell of his magic was forever broken by Harrison's
                    soldiers at <placeName>

            <p>It is not certain at what period in his career the Prophet was tempted by British gold and British
                    overtures. President Jefferson once wrote to John Adams as follows: "I thought there was
                    little danger in his making proselytes from the habits and comforts they had learned from the
                    whites, to the hardships and privations of savagism, and no great harm if he did. But his followers
                    increased until the British thought him worth corrupting, and found him corruptible."<hi rend="sup">17</hi>

                    brother-priest behind him and assumed the lead. That he had cunningly pretended to have great
                    respect and reverence while the Prophet was practicing on the superstition of the tribes; that he
                    took no steps to stop the inquisitions which were destroying the influence of the chiefs and
                    medicine men; that he stood ready at the opportune moment to push the brother-priest into the
                    back-ground and form a confederacy with himself as the recognized head, will not now admit of
                    controversy.</p>
            <p>In 1806 Tecumseh was about thirty-eight years of age, a finished athlete, a renowned hunter, and of
                    great reputation as a bold and fearless orator. Probably no red man ever born had a better knowledge
                    of the various treaties that had been consummated between the races. "For all those
                    qualities which elevate man far above his race; for talent, tact, skill, bravery as a warrior; for
                    high-minded, honorable and chivalrous bearing as a man; in fine, for all those elements of greatness
                    which place him: a long way above his fellows in savage life, the name and fame of Tecumseh will go
                    down to posterity in the West, as one of the most celebrated of the aborigines of this
                    continent." This is the estimate of Judge Law.<hi rend="sup">18</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In his youth he had been under the tutelage of his elder brother Cheeseekau, who taught him
                    "a love for the truth, a contempt of everything mean and sordid and the practice of those
                    cardinal Indian virtues, courage in battle and fortitude in suffering." In one of the early

                    to him that he made his associates promise never to torture another prisoner. The spoils of the hunt
                    he divided with the aged and unfortunate. At the time of the Prophet's rise he had
                    already matched his prowess in battle against such men as Simon Kenton and his associates and had
                    proven both his skill as a tactician and his courage as a fighter.</p>

                    that these gentlemen arrived at the village one evening and were received in an apparently friendly
                    manner by the Prophet and assigned a tent for the night with an agreed appointment for a council the
                    next morning. It is said the Prophet's wife was considered a queen among the Indian
                    women, as well as by her husband. Before retiring for the night the interpreter observed an unusual
                    stir among the squaws, and motions made toward their tent, and caught menacing glances and gestures
                    toward them, and so told the ambassador, but he made light of the matter and the
                    interpreter's suspicions that treachery was intended, and when night came on he was soon
                    asleep in peace and quiet. But not so with the vigilant interpreter who kept awake and had his guns
                    near at hand. About midnight a tap was heard at the door and his name, in a Shawnee language, was
                    called. He found Tecumseh at the door. He had called to warn him of impending assassination by the
                    Queen and squaws, who had held a council and determined on their death in spite of the protests of
                    himself and others who told them it would be base treachery to kill messengers of peace who were
                    their visitors. He told the visitors to rise and go with him. They went silently through the village
                    and down into a wooded ravine near the river, where a noise was made as if to call wild turkeys,
                    sounds well recognized by all hunters in early days; an answer was returned, and soon two men
                    appeared with the ambassador's horses which they speedily mounted and rode swiftly away,
                    accompanied by the two guides furnished by Tecumseh, and were soon well on their return trip to <placeName>

                    however, is given by Stanley Hatch, who had a personal acquaintance with him in times of peace:</p>
            <p>The general appearance of this remarkable man was uncommonly fine. His height was about five feet
                    nine inches, judging him by my own height when standing close to him, and corroborated by the late
                    Col. John Johnston, for many years Indian agent at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Piqua</settlement>
                    </placeName>. His face oval rather than angular; his nose handsome and straight; his mouth
                    beautifully formed, like that of Napoleon I, as represented in his portraits; his eyes clear,
                    transparent hazel, with a mild, pleasant expression when in repose, or in conversation; but when
                    excited in his orations or by the enthusiasm of a conflict, or when in anger, they appeared like
                    balls of fire; his teeth beautifully white, and his complexion more of a light brown or tan than
                    red; his whole tribe as well as their kindred the Ottawaws had light complexions; his arms and hands
                    were finely formed; his limbs straight; he always stood very erect and walked with a brisk, elastic,
                    vigorous step; invariably dressed in Indian tanned buckskin; a perfectly well fitting hunting frock
                    descending to the knee, and over his under clothes of the same material; the usual cape and finish
                    of yellow fringe about the neck; cape, edges 01 the front opening and bottom of the frock; a belt of

                    his left shoulder, used as a blanket in camp and as a protection in storms. Such was his dress when
                    I last saw him, on the 17th of August, 1812, on the streets of <placeName>

                    with his white allies in regard to the next movement of the now really commenced War of 1812. He was
                    then in the prime of life, and presented in his appearance and noble bearing one of the finest
                    looking men I have ever seen.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The striking circumstances of his birth, the ascendency of his brother, the Prophet; his burning
                    hatred of the white race; his skill as a hunter and valor as a warrior; above all his wonderful
                    eloquence and thorough knowledge of all the Indian treaties of the past, gave Teumseh an influence
                    and authority among the tribes far beyond that of any of the braves or sachems of that day. If at
                    the first his imagination had not dared to scale the heights of power, he later boldly threw aside
                    all disguise, and by his powerful advocacy of a communistic ownership of all the Indian lands by the
                    tribes in common, he aimed a blow both at the ancient authority claimed by the Indian chieftains,
                    and at the validity of every treaty ever negotiated between the two races of men. The sum and
                    substance of Tecumseh's doctrine is thus succinctly stated by Judge Law:</p>
            <p>That the Great Spirit had given the Indians all their lands in common to be held by them as such and
                    not by the various tribes who had settled on portions of it–claiming it as their own.
                    That they were mere squatters having no ''pre-emption right," but
                    holding even that on which they lived as mere ''tenants in common"
                    with all the other tribes. That this mere possession gave them no title to convey the land without
                    the consent of all. That no single tribe had the right to sell, that the power to sell was not
                    vested in their chief, but must be the act of the warriors in council assem of all the tribes, as
                    the land belonged to all–no portion of it to any single tribe.<hi rend="sup">21</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If these tenets were to hold, it was clear that any authority claimed by the chiefs to represent
                    their respective tribes in the sale or barter of any of the Indian domain was without foundation;
                    that any treaty not negotiated and ratified by a common council of all the warriors of all the
                    tribes, was null and void; that <placeName>

                    beginning. The doctrine thus enunciated was not entirely new. Tarhe, or the Crane, Chief of the
                    Wyandots, had announced at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Greenville</settlement>
                    </placeName>: "I now tell you, that no one in particular can justly claim this ground; it
                    belongs, in common, to us all; no earthly being has an exclusive right to it."<hi rend="sup">22</hi> But the plausible eloquence of Tecumseh, coming at a time when the star of
                    the red man was setting; when every passing day witnessed the encroachment of the white settlers,
                    gave a new ray of hope to the fainting tribes. The warriors, carried away by the dreams and
                    incantations of the Prophet, and sustained by the burning words of a new leader, who promised them a
                    restoration of their former glory, cast aside with contempt all the articles and solemn agreements
                    of the past, and were ready to take up the tomahawk in patriotic defense of their lands and homes.
                    Thus did Tecumseh look forward to the establishment of "a great and permanent
                    confederation–an empire of red men, of which he should be the leader and
                    emperor."</p>

            <p>I<hi rend="sc">N</hi> this single volume Professor Ford gives a good estimate and summary account of
                    that racial strain in the American population known as the "Scotch-Irish." It is
                    the stock that has produced in the South such men as the Calhouns, the Houstons, the Jacksons, and
                    Johnstons, and the Clarks, and in the North and West such men as the McKinleys, the Logans, the
                    McClellans, the Kirkwoods, and the McDonalds and a host of others whose ancestors, through their
                    fighting and pioneer spirit, helped to win the frontier for civilization. The story of the life of
                    these people is told from the time of the Scotch plantation in Ulster in 1609 to the influences they
                    are now exerting on current American life.</p>
            <p>It is only toward the end of his volume that the author notices the controversy over the definition
                    of the term "Scotch-Irish." He quotes the distinctions of John Fiske and Henry
                    Cabot Lodge between the Scotch-Irish and the Irish pure and simple; and he makes his text refer to
                    that "indisputable breed of people in the north of <placeName>
                        <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>
                    </placeName> introduced there by the Ulster Plantation." They were of the Scottish people
                    who had been living in <placeName>
                        <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>
                    </placeName>. When they came to America they were called "Irish," but they claimed
                    to be Scotch. While the Ulster Plantation was designed for an English settlement, the English
                    settlers there were soon absorbed by the Scottish element. So the author holds the use of the term
                    "Scotch-Irish" to be not only justifiable but required by accuracy as a
                    description of a distinct race stock.<hi rend="sup">*</hi> The English and Scotch

                    Indians. They felt that they had to "defend the borders and fortresses and suppress the

                    of their conflicts and customs in Ulster. He then proceeds to discuss in interesting and effective
                    pages the religious and moral customs of the Scotch-Irish; their relations to the English
                    government, the causes of their migration to America; the centers where they settled <pb n="176" id="VAA4025-012-2-082"/> their relation to the Indians, their influence on American independence
                    and American education and of their importance as a factor in American history. They were the first
                    to stand up in the cause of American independence, as shown in their Mecklenburg resolutions in <placeName>

                    </placeName>; and their ministry and people were always foremost and active in promoting the cause
                    of education. The volume shows the Scotch-Irish to be largely the source of American
                    Presbyterianism; among the boldest in extending the western confines of civilization; among the
                    bravest and most effective fighters in the Indian wars; and among the militant patriots in the
                    building of the nation and in the Revolutionary and other wars of the Republic. <placeName>

                    </placeName>. The work deals chiefly with the work of Presbyterian ministers and the planting of
                    Presbyterian churches and schools, and the descriptive accounts relate largely to persons and
                    localities as types of character and influence. The Reformed and Seceding Presbyterian bodies appear
                    to go unnoticed and the great part played by Scotch-Irish influences and settlements in the Piedmont
                    and up-land regions of the Carolinas and their migrations and settlements beyond the Alleghanies by
                    neighborhoods and congregations are almost entirely neglected. So noticeable is this that the work
                    might not unfairly be entitled "The Scotch-Irish in America on the Middle and North
                    Atlantic Sea Board."</p>
            <p>The subject of the volume is not easy for comprehensive treatment. Within its scope it is a valuable
                    and desirable study, of interest to all who care for American history and especially to all
                    Americans of Scotch-Irish stock. The Appendix of the volume contains a full list of authorities, a
                    list of the "Scottish Undertakers" in Ulster, the "Mecklenburg
                    Resolves" and other material of value. The author has placed thousands of Americans under
                    obligations to him for this work.</p>

            <p>S<hi rend="sc">OME</hi> years ago Dr. Sweet came into possession of the official records of the old
                    Indiana Conference. The first session of this conference met at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>, October 17, 1832, with eighteen circuit riders present and Bishop Joshua Soule in the
                    chair. The last session was held at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crawfordsville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, October 18, 1843, with Bishop James O. Andrew presiding and Matthew Simpson secretary.
                    There were ninety-three preachers ready to answer the first roll call. The minutes published by Dr.
                    Sweet thus cover a period of eleven years. The great problem of the church during this period was
                    organization. As the settlements spread to the north the church had to gather its adherents into
                    classes, circuits, and districts. In the first conference there were five districts, one being
                    missionary. Eleven years later there were sixteen districts. This period of remarkable growth is
                    covered by the book under review. Besides the ordinary work of the church its principal activities
                    during the period were the organization of Sunday schools, furnishing Bibles to the settlers,
                    publishing tracts and newspapers and missionary work. It was an endless task to finance the work.
                    Not only must the working circuit riders be supplied but money had to be raised for missions,
                    suppression of vice, negro colonization, aid of superannuated preachers and widows, and various
                    other purposes, not the least of which was education. Covering this period as it does, these minutes
                    furnish one of the best sources for early Indiana history. In publishing them Dr. Sweet has put all
                    the people of Indiana in his debt and especially is this true of the Methodists.</p>
            <p>The first ninety pages of the book are occupied with a historical introduction in which the history
                    of the church is brought down to 1832. In the preparation of this Dr. Sweet has had the advantage of
                    the large collection of material in Depauw University Library including a complete file of the <hi rend="i">Western Christian Advocate.</hi> The history of the pioneer Methodist church in Indiana
                    is the story of a valiant struggle. Preparing this has been a labor of love for Dr. Sweet. He has
                    done it well.</p>

            <p>Dr. Brownson has divided his thesis into six chapters. The first deals with "<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> in 1850" in which he gives an economic review of the State; the second chapter
                    deals with "The Land Grant and the Charter." The State was confronted at the time
                    with a peculiar situation. It had wasted considerable resources in attempting to carry out a system
                    of Internal Improvements by the State. There was a strong party demanding that the State also use
                    this land grant itself in building a State road, but it was decided to turn the grant over to a
                    private corporation which successfully built the road. The third chapter describes the building of
                    the charter lines; the fourth chapter deals with the "Development of the System;"
                    the fifth chapter takes up the question of "Traffic, 1857-1870." This chapter
                    forms an excellent economic history of the period. When the road was projected most of the produce
                    was marketed at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Cairo</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The road soon had to face about and prepare to carry its freight to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The last chapter deals with the "Finances and Financing of the
                    Road." The subject is thus far more than merely local. The author has used the official
                    reports and other contemporary sources. It is a very valuable and readable contribution.</p>

                    faces." The twelve chapter headings are as follows: Physical Basis; Trees; Agriculture;
                    Manufactures; Transportation; Labor; Labor Legislation; Government; Finances; Constitution;
                    Charities and Correction; Education. These topics are treated from the standpoint of the economist
                    and not from that of history or literature. The authors tell their story pointedly and without
                    praise or blame. Enough of the history of each subject is given to show the attitude of the people
                    and the present situation. The authors have depended for their data almost exclusively on official

                    subject into six parts or, as he calls them, periods. These are the "Aboriginal,"
                    "French Colonial," "British Colonial,"
                    "Revolutionary," "Territorial," and
                    "Statehood" periods. These periods are not considered as of equal importance. The
                    last one occupies one third of the book. The book opens with the poem, "Song of the Old Sac
                    Trail," by the author, and closes with a "School Song of Indiana," by the
                    author. The volume is necessarily a brief summary of the main features of our State history. Too
                    large a portion, sixty-three out of one hundred pages, is devoted to the period before 1816. The
                    last half century is disposed of in six <pb n="180" id="VAA4025-012-2-086"/> pages. Aside from the
                    inclusion of several questionable incidents, such as the bravado of Captain Helm at <placeName>

                    deceived Colonel Hamilton, a careful critical treatment has been preserved. The general tone of the
                    book is, as it should be, one of praise for the men and women who have made our State. It is a
                    readable book and should meet with a hearty reception by Indianians.</p>

            <p>I<hi rend="sc">N</hi> volume III Dr. Aurner takes up the secondary schools. In this field there was a
                    noticeable lack of unity or system. This fact <pb n="181" id="VAA4025-012-2-087"/> makes it
                    impossible to unify the volume as was done in the preceding and succeeding volumes. The author was
                    fortunate in having practically all the source material for his work in the library of the State
                    Historical Society. A glance at the chapter headings will give one the best idea of the scope of the
                    volume. Part I deals with the incorporated academies. The earliest of these was at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Dubuque</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1838. These were separately incorporated and each pursued its independent course.
                    The author singles out as the best example of these the "<placeName>
                        <country reg="dk">Denmark</country>
                    </placeName> Academy." Part II deals with the unincorporated academies. These were
                    generally private ventures. There were separate schools for boys and girls. In the later period of
                    the unincorporated academies, towns and other communities organized public schools similar to the
                    private ones. Part III deals with the special schools, the private normals and business colleges.
                    These seem to have been the forerunners of the professional schools. Part IV deals with secondary
                    schools under sectarian domination. Part V is devoted to the public high school. The different
                    phases of this movement are discussed under the county high school, the township high school, and
                    the district high school. There are eight chapters to this part and it is perhaps the most
                    satisfactory division of the volume. Part VI is devoted entirely to a historical discussion of the
                    courses of study.</p>
            <p>Volume IV takes up the history of the three State institutions for higher learning; the State
                    University at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Iowa City</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the State College of Agriculture and Mechanical Arts at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Ames</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the State Teachers College at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cedar Falls</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The volume contains a brief history of each of these institutions and offers little
                    ground for comment by the reviewer. The problems of the schools are indicated but for the most part
                    the author has been content to trace the growth of the institutions entirely from the historical
                    standpoint. The State is to be congratulated on the character of the work so far published.</p>

            <p>T<hi rend="sc">HIS</hi> is a companion volume to the <hi rend="i">Critical Period</hi> which appeared
                    last year. The present volume contains documents covering the period from February, 1765, to July,
                    1767. The same general plan of the series has been preserved. A twenty-eight page Introduction gives
                    the historical setting after which follow without individual introduction the various papers. Ample
                    footnotes explain the text. The papers are divided into ten chapters as follows: "George
                    Croghan's Journal, Feb. 28-Oct. 8, 1865;" "Occupation of Fort de
                    Chartres, July 24-Nov. 16, 1765;" "The Completion of the Occupation, Dec. 13,
                    1765-April 6, 1766;" "Plans for a Colony, March 9-May 10, 1766;"
                    "Conflicting Plans, May 10-June 15, 1766;" "The Rendezvous at the <placeName>

                    </placeName>, June 18-July 18, 1766;" "The Trade and Colonial Plans Progress, July
                    30-Oct. 11, 1766;" "The Value of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Illinois Country</region>
                    </placeName>, Nov. 21, 1766-Feb. 24, 1767;" "Discussion of the Indian Trade, March
                    1-July 15, 1767." The documents relate principally to the transfer of government at Fort
                    Chartres, the projected colony at the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, and the trade of the country. They include journals of such men as George Croghan,
                    correspondence of Sir William Johnson, William Franklin, Gage, Shelburne, Haldi-mand, Conway, and
                    the traders Baynton, Wharton and Morgan, official proclamations and instructions, plans for a
                    colony, petitions for land grants, and official records. As with the other volumes the work seems to
                    be carefully and accurately done, though, of course, the reviewer has not the means at hand to test
                    their accuracy.</p>

                    collecting material <pb n="183" id="VAA4025-012-2-089"/> on the county history. During those years
                    many stories and much biographical data were published in his paper. He also got together one of the
                    best collections of pioneer relics in the State. Mr. Stevens is a graduate of Indiana University,
                    class of 1867, a pioneer by instinct, and in sympathy with pioneer customs and characteristics. All
                    these qualities have enabled him to prepare a good history. This is especially true of those parts
                    of the book which treat of the lives of the early settlers. This part of his work and that which
                    deals with pioneer biography are better than those which deal with institutional development.
                    Whatever may be its historical value, the traditional or personal side of history will doubtless
                    always remain most interesting and in this field Mr. Stevens is best. Altogether it is a good resume
                    of the county history.</p>

            <p>T<hi rend="sc">HIS</hi> is not an ordinary county history, prepared by a publishing house and sold on
                    subscription. It has no subscribers and consequently no formal biographies. The author's
                    father, mother, and his maternal grandparents were for-two-thirds of a century in the front rank of
                    Perry county citizens. Perhaps no one in his day had a wider circle of friends and acquaintances
                    than the author's grandfather, Joshua Huckaby. Mr. De la Hunt, the author, is a graduate
                    of the University of the South, a man of wide culture and fine literary ability. Writing this
                    history has been a pleasant pastime with him for perhaps a score of years. He is acquainted with the
                    old folks and the young folks; every old house, old farm, and old church in the county, especially
                    in the southern half, has a personal relation. Mr. De la Hunt has not stopped with the artistic side
                    of his work, nor yet with the personal. Both these have been held firlmy in hand by the demands of
                    history. No clue has been too difficult nor too slight to prevent his making an effort to reach the
                    truth at the end, and when he fails, as all investigators must at times, he frankly says so. The
                    traditions of our people have been handled in a friendly way, but when historical proof failed we
                    are told so and exactly at what point. The story of Robert Fulton's residence in the
                    county, the shipwreck of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the Lincoln tradition, are all treated satisfactorily. The author had collected a
                    large amount of historical material relating to his county, among <pb n="184" id="VAA4025-012-2-090"/> this being a file of newspapers reaching back to the middle of the last century. Perry county
                    offered an attractive field for the historian. Its early settlers along the river from Rono to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Troy</settlement>
                    </placeName> were of the picturesque squatter type from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> interspersed with frequent scions of the good old <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> families. Among these came adventurers from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New England</settlement>
                    </placeName> interested in the natural resources, coal, clay, etc., and bringing with them the
                    thrift and genius of the Yankees; then came capitalists with visions of wealth through a union of
                    the cotton of the south and the fuel and labor of the north by means of the noble river as the
                    highway between. Later, just in time to feel the shock of the Civil War, came the Swiss and
                    established <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tell City</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The French located at Leopold in the heart of the county. In the north central part
                    was a colony straight from Erin, all good honest folk. The county sent men to the War of 1812, the
                    Mexican War and the Civil War. During the latter war armed enemies were not unknown in its border.
                    All these incidents have given the author an opportunity to write an interesting volume. No one who
                    reads all or any chapter of Mr. De la Hunt's book will fail to realize that he has done
                    his work satisfactorily.</p>

                                    lain for 150 years only imperfectly examined. The pioneer examiner stated that they
                                    were only notarial records; the next examiner found some family documents, but said
                                    they were not of much account any way. They were in such disorder that it was not

                        <p>About 18 months ago there came to the city a Mr. Price, a man whose education had
                                    fitted him marvelously to calendar these documents. He had been engaged with

                                    assistance of some wealthy friends to scrape up $50.00 a month which,
                                    while not adequate remuneration for such exceptional work, was at all events far
                                    more than Mr. Price had been earning for some time. Unfortunately the society was
                                    unable to increase the remuneration, and Mr. Price, considering it undignified to do
                                    the work for the sum available, gave it up and left the city. He had fortunately
                                    thoroughly examined at least 20 of the boxes at an average cost, I think, of
                                    $70.00 a box, and there are about 100. The resources of the society
                                    unassisted would provide a maximum of $400 a year for the purpose, so it
                                    is evident that the work had to come to a standstill. These twenty boxes may be seen
                                    through his calendaring to consist largely of papers used before the Conseil General
                                    as a judicial body. They run from about 1702 before its creation to 1780 after its
                                    development in the Cabildo.</p>

                    Indiana.–Ed.]</p>
            <p>A<hi rend="sc">MONG</hi> the amusements in which our ancestors of a hundred years or more ago
                    indulged occasionally was one called "Gander Pulling," which, though it may be
                    called cruel, was not such as involved human beings, as only a poor gander lost his life. The game
                    consisted in the effort to pull off the gander's head, the winner to get a small sum of
                    money, put up for the occasion. The gander's neck was stripped of feathers and thoroughly
                    greased. Then the poor bird was tied by his feet to the lower limb of a tree, just high enough to be
                    reached by a man on horseback. The judges, or umpires, were selected from among the bystanders, to
                    make the award, and to see that the game was played fairly. The branch to which the bird was hung
                    had to be as long, strong and springy as possible, and every contestant had to ride without a
                    saddle, with his horse at a gallop. Some twenty or thirty feet from the bird, a man was stationed on
                    each side of the track, armed with a long switch, whose business it was to see that no rider should
                    check the speed of his horse as he came near the bird. Imagine the frightened gander swinging
                    wildly, and fanning his wings in mid-air in his efforts to escape, and one can easily see that a
                    rider would have quite as many chances to miss the bird's neck entirely, as to grasp it.
                    Every such failure, of course, provoked the merriment of the bystanders. Sometimes, too, a rider
                    would lose his balance and fall from his horse because he hung to the gander too long, and thus in
                    addition to some bruises, he lost his place in the game, which was mirth provoking, also for the
                    crowd. Finally some tall fellow with one hand holding to the horse's mane and leaning
                    forward as far as possible, would seize <pb n="190" id="VAA4025-012-2-096"/> the poor
                    bird's head, giving it a sudden twist would break its neck, and then probably the man who
                    followed would be able to take off the bird's head. It was not so much a contest for the
                    purse, as for the rollicking fun that resulted, and as to cruelty, it was innocence itself, compared
                    to a modern game of football.</p>
