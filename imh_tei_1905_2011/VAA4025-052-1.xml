            <p>"What will History say?" asked Major Swindon of General Burgoyne, just before they
                    surrendered to the despised colonials at Saratoga.</p>
            <p>"History, sir, will tell lies, as usual," replied Burgoyne. That, at any rate, is
                    what George Bernard Shaw, in <hi rend="i">The Devil's Disciple</hi>, thinks he said. Now
                    Shaw, who did as much violence to history as any man who ever wrote a play, probably had his own
                    tongue in his cheek as was his custom when he put these words into General Burgoyne's
                    mouth. Unfortunately, there is a great deal of truth in them. Especially when it comes to wars, what
                    is accepted by the average man as history is likely to be a thick accretion of legends and
                    stereotypes. These are usually more comfortable and more flattering than the truth—and it
                    is certainly much easier to invent them than it is to dig out the disillusioning facts, especially
                    when no records can be found in which to do the digging. So, sometimes by default, history becomes a
                    weapon for the propagandist, a coat of whitewash for the blunderer, or a lovely fairy tale for the
                    children rather than the uncompromising, bitter-sweet, let-the-chips-fall-where-they-may presentment
                    of evidence which it ought to be.</p>
            <p>The basic reason for the organization of the Indiana War History Commission in 1942 was to guarantee,
                    so far as humanly possible, that history would tell no lies in recounting Indiana's part an
                    World War II.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Its immediate concern during the war years was the preservation
                    of records—a task which it <list type="footnotes">

                    open invitations for the myth-makers. The end of the war brought the collecting phase of the
                    commission's work to a virtual close. It then turned to the other indispensable part of its
                    mission, embodied in the 1947 act of the general assembly which made it an independent state agency
                    to "write, publish and sell a comprehensive history of the state's war
                        activities."<hi rend="sup">2</hi> The commission subsequently decided that the
                    execution of this mandate required the production of a ten-volume series to which was given the
                    general title <hi rend="i">Indiana in World War II.</hi> Three of these proposed
                    volumes—a gold star honor roll, a book of letters from Hoosiers in the armed services,
                    and a history of military installations within the state—were to cover the purely
                    military side of Indiana's war effort. A fourth was to be a general survey and personnel
                    directory of civilian war service in federal and state agencies and private organizations. Four of
                    the remaining volumes were to deal respectively with the industrial, agricultural, financial, and
                    social history of Indiana during the war years. Another book was to cover the story of civilian
                    defense in all of its ramifications, and the final volume was planned as a popular summary of the
                    entire series. Of these ten projected volumes, three have been published and are on the market, two
                    are now ready for publication, and three more are in various stages of advanced preparation.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Thus it is apparent that the research has been finished for eight of the ten
                    volumes and the entire project is rapidly nearing its original goal. The work is far enough advanced
                    that its final impact can be estimated: the rough outlines of the picture are clearly visible and
                    the details have been filled in for a great portion of the canvas. To some degree this paper may
                    serve as the forerunner of that last volume—the summary of the series—by
                    attempting to evaluate the results of more than a decade of research.</p>
            <p>The services of a special commission were not required to measure Indiana's participation in
                    the war effort statistically. It is well known that the state furnished approximately 363,000 men
                    and women to the armed forces of the nation and that more than 10,000 of these gave their lives in

                    statisticians declare that Indiana's manufacturers produced $3,200,000,000 worth
                    of war goods and that new war factories, costing more than a billion dollars, were erected within
                    her boundaries.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> Agricultural production in Indiana increased by 49 per cent
                    during the war years,<hi rend="sup">6</hi> the annual production of the coal mines almost

                    same time, paying nearly two and three-quarter billion dollars in taxes.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> These
                    figures are imposing but their significance is clarified only by comparisons with national totals or
                    with the accomplishments of neighboring states. It is instructive, for example, to learn that while
                    Indiana contained 2.6 per cent of the male population of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in 1940, she contributed only 2.5 per cent of the men in the armed forces and only 2.2
                    per cent of those who enlisted voluntarily, while Californians, who made up 5.3 per cent of the
                    population, comprised 5.9 per cent of the armed forces and 7.4 per cent of the volunteers.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> A more flattering comparison is that Indiana, which ranks twelfth among her
                    sister states in population, raised herself during the war from ninth place to seventh in the total
                    value of industrial products and that she ranked no less than third in the nation in her ratio of
                    war production to population.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What conclusions may be drawn from these facts? It is dangerous enough even for experts to venture
                    interpretations of contemporary history, but what this paper attempts is doubly perilous, since it
                    proposes to generalize upon others' interpretations. Doubly distilled deductions usually
                    either lose the original qualities of the brew entirely, or emerge as concentrations too potent to
                    be exposed to the public. Whichever <list type="footnotes">

                    may have been discovered through the commission's studies of Indiana's
                    participation in World War II.</p>
            <p>First of all, the war offered some proof that the proud boast "INDIANA—The Center
                    of Almost Everything" is not simply Chamber of Commerce propaganda but reasonably
                    demonstrable fact. Whether because of her geographical location at the center of population, her
                    unique combination of distance from the coasts but proximity to markets, her natural resources, her
                    transportation network, her skilled labor, her diversified industry, her educational system, the
                    skill of her politicians, or a judicious mixture of all these factors, it is certainly apparent that
                    Indiana was attractive both to military officers planning the location of key installations and to
                    governmental officials searching for the placement of war contracts. "They like us down in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>," Governor M. Clifford Townsend reported after a visit to the capital as early
                    as December, 1940.<hi rend="sup">12</hi> Nor was this just a politician's statement for
                    home consumption. Already by that time Du Pont had nearly finished construction of the gigantic
                    Hoosier Ordnance Plant at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Charlestown</settlement>

                    </placeName> Ordnance Plant at the other end of the state, the Navy had taken over half of Martin
                    County for the development of a billion dollar ammunition storage depot, and the Army had announced
                    plans for developing a fifty-six thousand acre proving ground in the hills behind <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> When World War II began there were only two major military
                    installations in Indiana—Fort Benjamin Harrison and the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                    </placeName> Quartermaster Depot. Before it ended there were thirty-one—ten ordnance
                    plants, seven air bases, six storage depots, five training camps, two great general hospitals, and
                    the Army's largest proving ground. The military contribution made by these installations
                    was considerable, but the economic and social consequences of their presence in Indiana were even
                    more significant.</p>
            <p>The story of the role which Indiana industry and labor played in the war is fundamentally the same

                    getting into defense production during 1940 and 1941. To some extent this was a matter of deliberate
                    choice, reflecting an isolationist attitude toward world affairs and a Republican distrust of New
                    Deal politicians. But it soon became a cause for alarm—the major contracts were going to
                    the great metropolitan centers and Indiana was not getting her share. Curtailment of purely civilian
                    goods such as automobiles and washing machines by government fiat, shrinking stockpiles of strategic
                    materials, and "priorities unemployment" actually brought a serious threat of

                    entry into the war and a vigorous campaign of protest in which Hoosier congressmen and

            <p>One of the finished manuscripts in the possession of the War History Commission is a history of
                    Indiana's war production record by George M. Blackburn, a former research assistant. Much
                    of this five-hundred-page manuscript is devoted to a recital of simple but incredible facts. There
                    is the story of Kaufman T. Keller, president of Chrysler Corporation, who was asked by Army Ordnance
                    if his <placeName>

                    </placeName> could produce .45 caliber cartridges by the billion. His answer was simply,
                    "Yes," and when the startled Army officer asked if decisions of this magnitude
                    were always so readily made, Keller replied, "Not always, Colonel, but we have been hearing
                    more and more about billions in recent years. I still can't imagine what a billion is like,
                    so I'd like to make billions of something and find out." The <placeName>

                    hoarded, or defrauded the government. It is safe to say, however, that there was much less of this
                    kind of thing than in any previous war in our history. The major fiascos—an unfinished
                    synthetic rubber plant at Gary, for example, upon which five million dollars were wasted without an
                    ounce of rubber being produced,<hi rend="sup">23</hi> or the ghost city at Kingsford Heights, where
                    fewer than one-sixth of the 3,000 new dwellings erected by the National Housing Agency were ever
                        occupied<hi rend="sup">24</hi>—could be blamed either upon unforeseeable developments
                    in a rapidly changing war, or upon poor planning by federal bureaucrats. The granting of Army-Navy
                    "E" awards to 174 Indiana factories affords some evidence that Hoosier management
                    and labor alike regarded their daily work in the light of patriotic duty during the war years.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A second generalization which emerges very clearly from each of the commission's studies is
                    that the war effort in Indiana had a pungent grass-roots flavor. So much emphasis has been placed by
                    both friend and foe upon the federal bureaucracy in recent years that one gets an impression of
                    monolithic government at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> crushing out all local initiative and self-direction. This was certainly not true in
                    Indiana. The record, in fact, shows that to a surprising degree, Indiana civilians fought the war in
                    their own way, sometimes with better and sometimes with worse results than when it was entirely
                    directed by national officials.</p>
            <p>Civilian defense is an excellent illustration of this point. Indiana did not wait for directives from
                    the federal government to begin organizing in this field: in fact, Hoosiers were somewhat overeager
                    in their formation of early vigilante groups without legal authority. It was partly to channel this
                    enthusiasm that Governor Townsend created an Emergency Defense Council on May 30, 1940, fully a year

                    The general assembly replaced this rudimentary committee on March 10, 1941, with a combination of
                    advisory and administrative councils which worked so smoothly that it became a model for many other
                    state defense organizations. Under the energetic leadership of Clarence A. Jackson, the Indiana
                    State Defense Council posted a brilliant record of accomplishment in coordinating the myriad facets
                    of civilian defense and civilian services. Many of its activities were unique, an excellent example
                    being the Indiana Plan of Bi-Racial Cooperation which attracted nationwide attention and received a
                    special citation of merit from the national Office of Civilian Defense.<hi rend="sup">27</hi> The
                    plan was itself a testimony to the state's sturdy independence, for it was conceived as a
                    means of warding off compulsory fair employment decrees in Indiana by accomplishing the same
                    objective through voluntary agreements. Headed by Theodore Cable of <placeName>

                    Activities Coordinator in the State Defense Council, the plan set up a number of biracial committees
                    throughout the state. Their chief function was to bring management, labor, and Negro representatives
                    together to plan for the equitable integration of the Negro labor potential into war industry and to
                    mitigate racial discrimination in employment, housing, schools, and recreation. Success in the first
                    of these objectives, at any rate, was indicated by a rise of 82 per cent in the number of Negroes
                    employed by Indiana industries within a year.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>

                    of a national guinea pig for all the social experiments that were devised to meet the staggering
                    problems of such overnight growth. With "powder workers" jammed into every garage
                    and chicken coop, stacked four deep in the town's two restaurants and ten deep in its

                    sanitation, garbage disposal, schooling, and recreation became nightmares to the harried local
                        officials.<hi rend="sup">30</hi> Neither the Du Pont Company nor the War Department assumed
                    responsibility for anything beyond the plant's gates, and it was still too early in the
                    defense program for any of the federal agencies which later multiplied like rabbits to offer advice.
                    The state government came to the rescue by sending a defense co-ordinator to the aid of the
                    bewildered town fathers. According to one of the priceless definitions that emerged from the war
                    "A coordinator is a man who brings organized chaos out of regimented

                    attitude toward the war—his tendency to be suspicious and perhaps hypercritical of

                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Much of this jaundice was undoubtedly justified but some of it was simply
                    pig-headed—unfortunately it is not always possible to classify the reaction. Even those
                    Hoosiers who willingly gave hours of voluntary time to selective service boards, war price and
                    rationing panels, or war finance committees were not loath to criticise what they considered to be
                    the bungling of their superiors. During the early months of the war, the Department of the Treasury
                    had developed two bond-selling organizations, one organized by internal revenue collector's
                    districts for day-by-day sales, another based on federal reserve districts for the First War Loan
                    Drive. Hoosier bond salesmen regarded this double-headed hydra as a wasteful duplication of overhead
                    and effort. During the Second War Loan, the Victory Fund Committee and the War Savings Staff in
                    Indiana combined their organizations so successfully that the Treasury Department adopted the scheme
                    on a national scale and finished the war with a single War Finance Division. Under the leadership of
                    Eugene C. Pulliam, more than eighty thousand volunteer workers in Indiana did an outstanding job of
                    persuading their fellow Hoosiers to invest in their national government.<hi rend="sup">34</hi>

                    tendency to ignore the states as "archaic" entities and to deal directly with the
                    cities. He reckoned without Jackson, who carried on an epistolary feud with the Little Flower which
                    made it crystal clear that civilian defense matters in Indiana would go through the state
                    office—and so they did. "Please advise somebody," Jackson wrote on one

                    jurisdiction. The same thing can be said for James D. Strickland, who administered the terrifyingly
                    complicated OPA system in Indiana from the day in 1941 when it consisted of himself and a secretary
                    planning a tire rationing program until its demise six years later. More than 77,000 people, in a
                    gigantic state office and 139 local boards, helped Strickland dole out the twenty rationed items and
                    regulate the prices of every commodity purchased by the hapless civilian. This was the most
                    unpopular of all the forms of regimentation endured by Hoosiers for the sake of victory, and it is a
                    tribute to the patriotism of Strickland and at least thirty-one local board chairmen that they

                    Nevertheless, a paper of this kind may be forgiven for venturing a few deductions on the basis of
                    plain evidence. Census figures show that Indiana's population increased by half a million
                    between 1940 and 1950, and that at least one-fifth of this increase came at the expense of other
                    states: in other words, many migrant workers and many soldiers who trained in Indiana camps became
                    permanent residents. Indiana's percentage gain was 14.8, slightly higher than the nation as
                    a whole.<hi rend="sup">44</hi> Thus it is clear that Indiana's attractiveness as a place to
                    live increased relatively as a result of the war. However, the change was slight, and except for
                    such spectacular developments as the overnight transformation of <placeName>

                    agricultural and coalmining regions continued to lose population as they had before the
                    war—in fact, one of the great disappointments of the war boom was that neither the <placeName>

                    majority of Indiana's war industries converted to peacetime production after 1945, but
                    Allison continues to manufacture jet engines, Eli Lilly is still growing penicillin in the tanks

                    of Hoosier scientists are engaged in research for the armed forces. Aided by the experience and
                    additional capacity gained through war production, Indiana has risen to a foremost rank among her
                    sister states in the manufacture of more than sixty products. She stands first in the making of
                    power transmission and engine electrical equipment, second in aircraft engines and farm machinery,
                    third in steel mills and motor vehicles, and fourth in the electronics industry.<hi rend="sup">46</hi> The war unquestionably increased the prosperity and physical comfort (and taxes!) of
                    virtually every resident of Indiana.</p>
            <p>The question that inevitably arises in the minds of thoughtful Hoosiers is whether these gains were
                    purchased at too high a price in the immediate losses of the war or in that spiritual demoralization
                    which we have learned to expect in the train of Mars. While the commission does not have categorical
                    answers to this question, it has collected data of the sort not ordinarily found even in the
                    newspapers, which may help ultimately to arrive at the answer. One of the best jobs of research done
                    for the War History Commission was carried on by Max Cavnes, in the field of social changes in the
                    Indiana community during the war years. Cavnes not only examined the supply of materials on this
                    all-embracing topic in the commission files and in the Indiana newspapers, but he searched the
                    National Archives in <placeName>

                    agencies, information which serves to balance the somewhat overly optimistic view which Hoosiers are
                    likely to take of their own accomplishments. The reports of Fair Employment Practices Committee
                    investigators show that despite all the vigorous efforts of the biracial committees, <list type="footnotes">

                    but there were still many places in Indiana at war's end where he could not be employed as
                    a skilled laborer, get a technical education, live in a modern house, or buy a meal in a

            <p>Indiana's children may be thought of as another minority group victimized by the war. At
                    school they suffered from overcrowded, underheated, obsolete classrooms, forced upon them by the
                    necessary cessation of the normal school-building program, and from too few and too poorly trained
                    teachers. This was the result, not only of the war, which drafted great numbers of teachers into the
                    armed services, but of years of pinch-penny policy which drove good teachers with inadequate
                    salaries into more highly paid war jobs.<hi rend="sup">48</hi> At home the children suffered from
                    the neglect of parents, especially when mothers as well as fathers accepted full time employment in
                    war plants. State and federal agencies did something for the babies by encouraging the establishment
                    of day nurseries,<hi rend="sup">49</hi> but the rise in juvenile delinquency among the
                    "latchkey children" was probably beyond the wit of man to counteract. The
                    establishment of boys clubs and teen-age recreation centers by many communities was a worthy
                    gesture, but it did not strike at the root of the problem—nothing short of the revival of
                    the American home could do that.<hi rend="sup">50</hi>

            <p>The most pitiful victims of the war, because the most helpless, were the inmates of
                    Indiana's institutions for the paupers, the aged, the physical and mental defectives, and
                    the lawbreakers. From county home and city jail to state asylum and penitentiary, these institutions
                    were, almost without exception, a disgrace to a civilized people. The evidence for this statement
                    lies, not in the exposures of sensation-seeking journalists, but in the annual reports of the

                    it to say that the war simply aggravated almost beyond endurance the evils which had long haunted
                    these places of misery—totally inadequate budgets, grossly underpaid and consequently
                    incompetent personnel, and obsolete equipment. In 1942, Indiana ranked thirty-ninth among the

                    war may be said to have brought was a renewed consciousness of duty on the part of the people, and a

            <p>To turn from a subject on which there is no excuse for ignorance to one in which the truth is usually
                    concealed from the public, Cavnes's research in the records of the Social Protection
                    Division of the Federal Security Agency, headed by Indiana's own Paul V. McNutt, revealed
                    the sorry fact that the director's home state gave his agents less than half-hearted
                    support in their efforts to suppress wartime prostitution. This program of suppression was not
                    undertaken as a moral crusade but as the only effective way to control venereal disease which had
                    incapacitated the equivalent of twenty-three divisions in the army during World War I. That Indiana,
                    swarming as it was with men in uniform during the early months of the war, needed a program of
                    venereal control was made abundantly clear by selective service doctors who discovered syphilis
                    infection in thirty-four out of every thousand Hoosiers they examined—the highest rate in

                    within the constitutional powers of the federal government—it depended entirely upon
                    local law and law enforcement. The agents of the Social Protection Division could only advise,
                    plead, and exhort. This they did with good effect in many Indiana towns, but in others they found
                    that the ancient alliance between prostitution and politics still prevailed—there were
                    too many mayors, police chiefs, or district attorneys who were indifferent or openly hostile to a

            <p>To end this survey upon a more cheerful note it might be well to examine briefly the effect of the
                    war upon higher learning in Indiana. It is a matter for astonishment and pride that all but one of
                    Indiana's forty-three colleges and universities survived the harrowing problems of the war
                    years when male students virtually disappeared from the campuses, faculty members were drafted into
                    government service, and incomes from endowment as well as from tuition dwindled to a tiny trickle. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> College, with a normal average enrollment of about 450, was down to ten civilian
                    students in 1945, and even Indiana University, supported by the state treasury, had incurred a
                    deficit of $264,000 by the middle of the war.<hi rend="sup">54</hi> The means by which
                    college administrators and professors solved these problems were no less ingenious than the devices
                    by which Indiana business men overcame their production snafus. Accelerated programs, budget-paring,
                    eloquent appeals to alumni and church constituencies, curriculum changes, faculty overloading,
                    campaigns for more coed and 4-F students, research contracts, and—of
                    course—major assistance from the federal government in the form of army and navy training
                    programs saved the day. It should be noted, however, that twenty-four of the state's
                    colleges managed to survive without federal assistance of any kind, and that, contrary to outside
                    impressions, those which undertook the training of soldiers or sailors reaped no golden harvests
                    from Uncle Sam's treasury—the contracts were carefully devised to meet expenses
                    and nothing more.<hi rend="sup">55</hi> Most interesting of all was the adaptation which college

                    dissected internal combustion engines, and at least one history professor became a so-called expert
                    in Morse code. Whether this versatility carried over into the postwar period is another question
                    which the War History Commission has not asked itself.</p>
            <p>The War History Commission was not told to write a history of Indiana's intellectual
                    response to the war: perhaps that cannot be done. Did World War II engender the same kind of
                    hysteria in Hoosiers which led them to prohibit the teaching of German in the schools in 1917? Did
                    Indiana succumb to the kind of postwar depravity which had fostered the Ku Klux Klan in the
                    twenties? Did Hoosiers, on the other hand, achieve a new sense of world responsibility and a new
                    understanding of world problems from their participation in the war? Perhaps they did. But the
                    evidence is not yet complete and irrefutable. Only time, and future historians, will tell.</p>

                    </placeName> history was still a matter for dispute in the 1880's. Henry Irving, after his

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1884, told a <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> reporter that he was not impressed by the culture of the city. He thought the theater
                    there might some day become a " 'very good place of amusement,'
                    " but at the moment <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> was not a congenial home for high forms of art. Many persons would rather pay ten cents
                    for an afternoon in a side show. The local press, he thought, was far ahead of the people. The
                    editor of the <hi rend="i">News</hi> countered that in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Irving had enjoyed larger audiences in proportion to its population than anywhere else
                    in the country except on one occasion in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and that the general reaction was excellent, for the audience was responsive in a high
                    degree to every action in his performance. Previously Irving had actually commended <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> audiences for their preference for Shakespeare over melodrama. Furthermore, the editor
                    pointed out, to know people, one must meet them in their homes, and that privilege had been denied
                        Irving.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another criticism levelled at the theater came from the pulpit, which attacked the ballet as a device
                    of the devil; therefore it was the duty of Christians to discountenance it. The editor of the <hi rend="i">Sentinel</hi> defended the ballet by declaring that it was as permanently fixed as the
                    drama or the opera, and that it was picturesque and pretty. Though the nudity of ballet was its
                    chief attraction, fashion had approved this nudity on the stage, and there it would stay regardless
                    of the opinions of pulpit or press.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

                    two principal theaters were active rivals. This cutthroat policy ended when all theaters in the city

            <p>In 1881 theater managers estimated the theater-going public of the city at about ten thousand. On
                    this basis, it was felt that a paying patronage could not possibly be furnished for three
                    first-class theaters because there simply were not enough people.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> During fair
                    week, of course, business always boomed, and larger audiences could be expected. In 1887 record
                    attendance at all theaters was observed. All seats were filled and hundreds were unable to gain
                    admittance. But among those who usually attended were some crude and uncouth persons who disturbed
                    and annoyed others in the audience. The editor threatened to publish his list of names of such
                    persons, whom he branded as "gadwumps," if their conduct did not improve. Manager
                    George Dickson thought some of this poor attitude was probably a result of the actions of management
                    itself, for during the period of competition when business was divided the managers could not fill
                    their houses by showing only first-class productions at good prices; they therefore resorted to
                    lower type shows at cheaper prices. Since people had lost confidence and were not attracted by the
                    better shows, the whole business deteriorated, giving <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> a poor reputation as a show town. By 1888 Dickson asserted that this period had passed
                    and that he intended to build up the business and improve the city's reputation<hi rend="sup">5</hi>—good advertisement, of course, for all theaters in <placeName>

            <p>The types of shows presented in the 1880's varied all the way from Shakespeare to variety,
                    with the latter definitely on the increase. Burlesque was extremely popular, but since there were
                    not enough of these shows to fill the season, variety bills were assembled with the assistance of <placeName>

            <p>George Dickson's opinion notwithstanding, the legitimate theater itself was felt to be in a
                    decline. The change from the old system of local stock to the itinerant combination meant that the
                    entire cast with scenery, costumes, and properties travelled from town to town. Thus the local
                    theater was reduced to nothing but a shell of what it had formerly been. At one time a complete
                    organization of artists and actors with a talented and capable manager could be found in every town;
                    only the star traveled and found his support and all the mechanism of the play ready in each theater
                    to perform with him. An aura of dignity surrounded the star, who strongly favored only high-class
                    plays. Now the combination system changed all that. The tremendous expense involved in transporting
                    scenery and costumes as well as large companies of actors caused actors' salaries to
                    suffer. The only solution was to make more money. Since an increase in box office receipts required
                    larger audiences, managers sought cheaper shows to attract more classes of people, for only lower
                    prices would permit them to attend. This theater for revenue only brought about its own
                    deterioration as well as that of public taste; the decline was felt somewhat in tragedy, more in
                    drama, but most in comedy. The best patrons of the theater were thus being driven from it, were
                    losing the habit of going to the theater, and would not attend even the better shows which were

            <p>On September 27, 1880, the new English's Opera House was formally opened to the public with
                    a performance of <hi rend="i">Hamlet</hi>, starring Lawrence Barrett. Some had attempted to dissuade
                    William H. English when he had announced his intentions in March, 1880, but he planned to erect a
                    building that would serve both the state and the nation, for he hoped to complete his theater in
                    time for the 1880 political conven-ventions. Perhaps English's only concern was the welfare
                    of his son, William E., who appeared restless and uncertain as to his career in life and travelled
                    about the world wherever his fancy led him. No doubt the father understood his son's
                    fondness for the theater, for the complete management of the opera house was at once turned over to
                        him.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>

            <p>In September, 1883, the great Thomas W. Keene appeared in <hi rend="i">Macbeth</hi> and rated a most
                    searching comment from the critic of the <hi rend="i">News.</hi> The quality of this criticism is
                    superior to that found in other papers of the period and is characteristic of the style of writing
                    of that time.</p>
            <p>"Mr. Keene made a popular success as 'Macbeth' before a brilliant audience
                    last night; but not an artistic success. Macbeth is not an inviting character nor an inviting play
                    for the stage. All the evil powers of earth and air are called on, uncanny spirits, bats and toads,
                    'hell-broth,' dire prophecy, 'murder most foul,' the wickedest
                    ambitions of distorted humanity, have a generous and noble nature 'infirm of
                    purpose' to work on for its destruction. Mr. Keene's conception is not harmonious
                    in giving the proper proportions to this dual character. He emphasizes too much its infirmity. His
                    Macbeth at times becomes almost a whimpering, terror-stricken boy. He does not get an intellectual
                    grasp of the character which reaches its core, but plays it from the surface, and hence lacks
                    dignity. Not to make an odious comparison, he has in his leading support an example of the manly
                    strength and repose he would do well to emulate. Popular appreciation of tempestuous acting in this
                    country has been largely molded by the universal prevalence of stump oratory. When a man shakes the
                    hair down over his eyes and stamps and roars and defies the other party he always rides on waves of
                    applause. Accordingly when Mr. Keene did just that as Macbeth, he was greeted with applause and cat
                    calls. The tendency to rant in Macbeth is almost inevitable, and Mr. Keene ranted. He tore every
                    passion to tatters and overdid everything, with the exception of his first Sight of
                    Banquo's ghost. There his action was high and noble, not merely noisy, but forcible. On the
                    contrary at the second view of the ghost he squealed and spluttered in headlong declamation as
                    mechanical <list type="footnotes">

                    with him and with some of the other characters, too much of the common burglar style of slipping
                    around the room and feeling for the doors and windows in order to indicate suppressed fear and the
                    tension of watchfulness. On the other hand great praise is due the star for his industry and
                    earnestness; he slights nothing, and his 'business,' never slovenly, was almost
                    always effective. Nothing could have been better than his death scene. There one climax capped
                    another in the most thrilling and effective way possible. The support was unusually good, deserving
                    of a specification which space will not here allow. The result was a performance more evenly
                    excellent than is generally given."<hi rend="sup">21</hi>

            <p>Later that season, in February, 1884, Henry Irving and Ellen Terry came for three nights. Supported
                    by the Lyceum Company, they opened with two unimportant pieces and followed with <hi rend="i">Louis
                        XI</hi> and <hi rend="i">Merchant of Venice.</hi> Irving was regarded as the perfect Louis XI.
                    The commentator said that "in all theatrical effects, in the expression of physical facts,
                    in the use of every bit of mechanism … Irving is perfect." Testifying to
                    audience appreciation, "The first two acts were played almost to the music of applause, so
                    frequently did these spontaneous demonstrations burst forth. … the applause would not be
                    denied and he had to wait until it spent itself. On the contrary in the last act the unbroken
                    silence was painful. Finer testimony to an artist's power was not given than by last
                    night's audience."<hi rend="sup">22</hi> As for Miss Terry, "Words fail
                    to depict this 'Portia.' The exquisite sensibility causes real tears. …
                    Has all this ever been equalled? … When she kneels to Bassanio … the audience
                    hugged the humor of it to its very soul; and last of all the loving reconciliation that takes
                    'Bassanio' and 'Antonio' by the hand, shed a sweetness on the
                    scene once felt never to be forgotten. When shall we ever see such a 'Portia?'
                    When such a performance of 'the Merchant of Venice?' The audience filled the house
                    in every part, and one so wrapt, so spontaneous in its manifestations of delight, is rarely
                        seen."<hi rend="sup">23</hi>

                    the most amusing thing seen in many months, and Kendall was regarded as "immense."

            <p>From the time English's Opera House opened in 1880, it was involved in bitter rivalry with
                    the Grand Opera House; much of it was normal business competition, each manager striving to sign up
                    the finest and best the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> stage had to offer. But because the number of paying theater-goers in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> was somewhat limited, the competition turned into a struggle for survival and
                    occasionally descended to a low level, becoming petty, bitter, and personal. English often gave vent
                    to his feelings in his advertising columns and in the news items in his theater programs. From the
                    beginning of this rivalry, Dickson Brothers had advertised the Grand Opera House as the largest and
                    best theater in Indiana. English claimed that distinction for his own theater, and finally issued a
                    statement which was published several times in both the <hi rend="i">News</hi> and in the <hi rend="i">Daily Stage</hi>, his theater program. He declared that English's Opera House
                    was the largest and best theater in Indiana, but that advertisements in the newspapers often called
                    Dickson's the largest and best. "Now, for the benefit of these persons, or any
                    other adventurous gentlemen, who may desire to chance their substance thereon, and in order to
                    settle this question decisively now and forever, the following wagers are proposed: (1) From
                    $100 to $5,000 that English's Opera House has more seats on the first
                    floor than Dickson's Opera House." Then followed eight more propositions, betting
                    a like amount that English's floors, stage, and entire auditorium were larger and that it
                    was safer from fire hazards. The article concluded with the statement that the propositions were
                    "to be taken as a whole, and count, measurement and decision to be made <list type="footnotes">

                            out that it was customary for actors to arrange personally with local printers for their own
                            programs and advertising. The printers thus came to know many members of the acting
                            profession and often became deeply interested in the stage. Local people also enjoyed other
                            contacts with famous stars of both the legitimate and concert stage. Since three-night
                            stands were common for the better performers, local socialites made the most of their
                            opportunities and frequently arranged receptions or teas for their favorites. Stars who
                            returned year after year thus formed friendships and occasionally a member of the profession

                    Popular—the Convenient."<hi rend="sup">28</hi>
            </p>
            <p>W. E. English often boasted that his offerings were higher class than those appearing at the Grand
                    and that those who performed at the latter place did so only because they found it impossible to
                    obtain a date on the already full schedule at English's. He also pointed out that
                    English's engaged only first-class attractions and kept open every week with the best
                    performers on the road, while the Grand had not been open one full week out of seven; at one time
                    the latter was closed entirely for two weeks because it could not obtain first-class entertainment.
                    On other occasions he insisted he would never descend to the practice common to the Grand, that of
                    Sunday shows. But he was not always consistent: Program notes stated that Dickson's
                    employed low-quality actors such as Ada Gray and Frank Frayne; later he announced as coming
                    attractions at English's those same actors.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This rivalry ended at the close of the 1885–1886 season when Henry Talbott leased
                    English's Opera House for a year, with a five-year option. Talbott had formed a partnership
                    with George A. Dickson and would be sole manager of the English, while Dickson remained manager of
                    the Grand. The effect of the partnership would be to end the keen competition that had had a bad
                    result on theatrical business for all concerned. It was also announced that the English Hotel had
                    been leased to a hotel man from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> and that W. E. English would go abroad. English continued to manage his Opera House
                    until 1887, when he made a three-year tour of Europe and the East.<hi rend="sup">30</hi>

            <p>The appearance of the Grand Opera House had changed but slightly. In 1881 it had acquired a new drop
                    curtain; at the same time some redecorating was done and draperies of satin and velvet added. Before
                    the 1882–1883 season opened the walls of the auditorium were refinished with elaborate
                    designs worked out by May Henry, George Dickson, and Eugene Ellis. Redecorations and new carpeting
                    were added in 1885, and in 1886 a wainscoting of quilted blue satin was installed around the walls
                    and across the fronts of the proscenium boxes to contrast with a new interior finish of cherry red.
                    In order to assist patrons in selecting seats, the main floor was described as follows: the first
                    eleven rows, all sofa chairs, were to be known as "orchestra"; the next five rows
                    were the "orchestra circle"; and the six rows nearest the entrance were designated

                    Barrymore, Drew, Mantell, Mansfield, and Marlowe, yet in their time they were unsurpassed as
                    dramatic actresses. Both were Polish and seemed to possess unusual ability in personating
                    characters. Madame Janauschek carried her audience by the force of her genius and truthfulness of
                    her portrayal. She stood at the head of a school of acting which was then giving place to the
                    so-called emotional drama. Of Modjeska, critics stated that to criticize her was like trying to
                    "pick flaws in a diamond," so exquisitely perfect was her artistry. Her
                    performance was compared with the art of Meissonier where a crowded canvas showed each detail
                    perfectly. "To specify her delicate work were like describing frost tracery."<hi rend="sup">44</hi> By comparison Maurice Barrymore seemed to strut in egotistical fashion, aware
                    of his handsome appearance, always too much the gentleman with a reserved and somewhat wooden
                    manner, unable to lose himself in the character. Robert Mantell had been Modjeska's leading
                    man the preceding season and appeared in 1883 as a star, demonstrating the greatness of his talent.
                    His vehicle, <hi rend="i">Romany Rye</hi>, a popular play of the time, exhibited unusual scenic and
                    mechanic effects. Richard Mansfield was well received by large audiences who thought his Prince Karl
                    an excellent piece of acting. Clara Morris could portray the complete gamut of emotions with the
                    truthfulness and accuracy of a camera taking a photograph. Her audience showed appreciation by
                    recalling her with applause after every act. Lawrence Barrett in <hi rend="i">Francesca da
                    Rimini</hi> was said to have given the finest personation of his career, and by adapting this play
                    from a reading to an acting version had contributed more to the American stage than any other living
                    actor. One who later saw Booth and Barrett together was much more commendatory to Booth. Barrett
                    possessed a broad British accent which detracted from his characterization and gave the feeling that
                    he never quite lost himself in his role as did Booth. Barrett was quite handsome and considered an
                    ideal Hamlet in appearance.<hi rend="sup">45</hi>

                    afforded the opportunity to witness legitimate comedy as it was last night presented at the Grand
                    Opera House by Robson and Crane. It has grown almost to be established custom where either star or
                    manager essays the production of the legitimate, to surround the central figure with a supporting
                    company of even less than … mediocre abilities, and … make everything entirely
                    dependent on the individual success of the person whose name appears in largest letters on the

                        trying to see over or around the hat, he discovered that its wearer was endeavoring to see over
                        a still higher hat in front of her. He recommended that a section of the theater be reserved to

            <p>Toward the close of the decade, burlesques were frequently seen at both the Grand and

                    creating all the fun. Its unique, rapid, and exciting action kept its audience highly

            <p>The theater third in importance was the Metropolitan, or Park. After 1879 it was renovated and opened
                    as the new Park Theater with Joseph Jefferson as the attraction. It remained a legitimate theater
                    from 1880 through the 1882–1883 season, and during this period presented a variety of
                    types of shows.</p>
            <p>A performance long remembered at the new Park was that of Sarah Bernhardt in February, 1881. She
                    arrived in a special car which had been sent to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, for her to prevent delays. Crowds greeted the actress but she remained aloof;
                    the entire company was entertained at the Bates House. The advance seat sale for her two
                    performances, <hi rend="i">Camille</hi> and <hi rend="i">Frou Frou</hi>, amounted to
                    $5,000 and the total box office receipts were $6,284. Some young society
                    ladies complained that their gentleman friends were unable to secure tickets for love or money. But
                    the critic concluded that the young men probably objected to the moral (or immoral) influence the
                    French actress might have over their lady friends. The principal criticism of many was not the
                    actress herself but the character of Camille, who was looked upon as a common prostitute.<hi rend="sup">54</hi>

                    </placeName> society was still too puritanical to take such a character to its collective heart.</p>
            <p>Plays, minstrels, light opera, Tom Thumb, and Lily Langtry were among the other attractions at the
                    Park in the 1882–1883 season. The first show after the Park became transformed to a
                    variety house, Ida Siddon's Mastodon Female Minstrels, well known in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, included many specialties such as dancing, singing, ventriloquism, marching, and
                    athletic exhibitions, and closed with a somewhat loud and dreary burlesque of <hi rend="i">Cinderella.</hi> The performance was risquée, of the type usually enjoyed by an
                    exclusively male audience.<hi rend="sup">55</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Throughout the 1883–1884 season, to February, 1884, the Park was operated under an
                    arrangement by which George Dickson and Charles Gilmore of the Zoöological Garden
                    combined the interests of both theaters, converting the Park into a vaudeville or variety theater.
                    Its storeroom on the first floor was changed into refreshment, bar, and billiard rooms, and a new
                    ten-foot-wide stairway was constructed which led to the theater on the floor above. Prices were
                    lowered to <list type="footnotes">

                    auditorium the orchestra space was cut down, the main aisle widened, and more seats added to
                    increase its capacity to 1,600. Two exits to the gallery were provided, and an iron stairway to the
                    street was erected outside. And wonder of wonders! Four electric lights were installed to illuminate
                    the building, and another was situated at the head of the stairs near the box office. The theater
                    then became part of the "Great Western Circuit" with the season to run five weeks.

            </p>
            <p>On opening night of this short variety season at the Park, the audience experienced an unexpected bit
                    of drama. William La Haire, whose specialty was "ceiling walking," took three
                    steps, a loop of rope gave way, and he fell twenty-five feet to the stage. Excitement reigned until
                    the manager rang down the curtain and announced that no dangerous injuries had been sustained. But
                    La Haire was unconscious and remained so for some time. Later he was removed to his hotel,
                    "where he now lies in a badly jammed condition." He had received a broken left
                    wrist, a broken rib, dislocated knee, multiple bruises, and possible internal injuries. His
                    attendant had warned him of the bad condition of the apparatus, but having no money for repairs, the
                    actor had planned to use it once more and then ask for an advance on salary to get the mechanism
                    fixed. Gilmore and Dickson assumed responsibility for the performer until his recovery.<hi rend="sup">57</hi>

            <p>After a successful period as a variety theater, the Park succumbed to the roller-skating craze which
                    swept the city in 1884 and was transformed into a skating rink. A double floor, illuminated by
                    electric light, was laid over the stage, parquet, and part of the dress circle. At the opening
                    performance, February 15, a polo game was played between the local club and one from <placeName>

                    quite popular. A rink had also been constructed at Masonic Hall just across the street, and another
                    was to open soon on North Meridian Street.<hi rend="sup">58</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The managers, Gilmore and Dickson, shortly announced that they would remodel the Park, enlarge and
                    improve the present rink, and establish a Dime Museum. Admission to the shows was ten cents, and
                    much was made of this low price in the fall of 1885, as hard times began to affect business. Plays
                    and variety shows were presented and in November, 1886, Augustin Daly's famous melodrama,
                        <hi rend="i">Under the Gaslight</hi>, was performed for ten, twenty, and thirty cents. In 1887
                    two grand operas were included in a season of light opera, the prices again ten, twenty, and thirty
                    cents. Later that season a play, <hi rend="i">An American Princess</hi>, presented Anna Mortland, a
                    local actress, in the role of Lady Dunmore.<hi rend="sup">59</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The general lowering of the quality of presentations brought the accompanying problem of lower-class
                    audiences in which objectionable conduct was often witnessed. The management felt compelled to issue
                    a statement which amounted almost to an order or a threat: The public was warned that any patron who
                    did not conform to the rules of good conduct would be "bounced."<hi rend="sup">60</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In December, 1886, the Eden Musée was established on the floor below the Dime Museum and
                    opened daily from nine in the morning until eleven at night, for an admission fee of only ten cents.
                    All sorts of novelties were presented, from a display of <hi rend="i">The History of a Crime</hi> in

            <p>In 1888 the Park was sold to Dickson and Talbott, who improved and changed it back to a legitimate
                    theater but allowed the Eden Musée to remain downstairs. The box office was located on
                    the street level and more exits installed. An audience of 2,200 crowded in to see a performance of

            <p>The Zoo, or Gilmore's Zoöological Garden, continued to prosper as a variety
                    theater during the 1880's. Early in the decade it was enlarged, the roof raised, and a
                    gallery added. The manager also established as an experiment an elevated garden on the new rear roof
                    of the theater. This was operated as a summer resort and was apparently successful. Free concerts
                    were held there every night and presumably the only charge to patrons was for the refreshments
                    consumed. Although variety shows with specialty acts were usually seen there, on one occasion <hi rend="i">The Black Crook</hi> was presented. The advertisements for the Zoo often stated
                    something of this nature: "Opposite New State House is the only Variety Theater in the
                    City. Don't fail to see the show. It is great." No mention was made of a star, for
                    there was none in the commonly accepted sense. Although other, better theaters in the city often
                    presented variety type programs, there were probably other characteristics of the Zoo to which many
                    people objected. In 1885 Gilmore began construction of a three-story brick building over the Zoo
                    which he planned to call "The Gold Mine." A year later this item appeared:
                    "The Zoo theater has closed indefinitely. 'Tis well."<hi rend="sup">63</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A letter to the editor of the <hi rend="i">News</hi> described the Zoo as one customer saw it. The
                    writer stated that he had a son in high school and wished to learn what sort of place that
                    "den of iniquity" was so that he might better protect his son. After paying
                    admission he passed up a long hall filled with men, boys, and lewd women. There was a performance of
                    the usual kind, and intoxicants were freely sold and drunk by those present. Before leaving he heard
                    an announcement of a slugging match to be held later—a violation of law. From the theater
                    proper he entered a room on one side of which was a long bar and on the other a number of curtained

                    conversation accompanied by frequent rounds of drinks. Above this was located a so-called reading
                    room which resembled a country bar. In another room he found a small stage flanked by
                    "wine-rooms" in which the stars could meet their friends; members of the audience
                    and waiters were constantly entering and leaving the latter. Adjoining the upper hall he noted a
                    number of private rooms which he did not investigate. The whole atmosphere of the place appeared to
                    him to be one of lewdness, profanity, obscenity, and drunkenness. The proprietor protected the
                    establishment by placing scouts outside to warn him of the approach of the police.<hi rend="sup">64</hi>

                    theater. No liquor or cigars were to be sold or permitted to be sold on the premises. To implement
                    his promise, the new manager announced that the Home Dramatic Combination would open the season by
                    presenting a sensational drama, <hi rend="i">Our Railroad Men</hi>, at the popular prices, ten,

                    enlarged with the addition of new chairs, private boxes, and a gallery, the Garden was to be
                    reopened as a licensed variety theater and the sale of liquors by waiters henceforth prohibited.<hi rend="sup">67</hi> There was also a theater called the Academy of Music, which had formerly been
                    known as Crone's Garden. In 1881 the Mansur heirs, owners of this building, decided to
                    close it up. The manager, who had been losing money anyway, planned to join the staff of the Zoo.<hi rend="sup">68</hi>

            <p>The Bijou Theater was advertised as the only safe variety theater in the city and claimed to attract

                    liquor was freely sold; it also employed a full brass band which played at intervals. There was,

                    horse-trainer, a bird-trainer, scenes from the Spanish Inquisition, and the death scene of General

                    the circus ring and menagerie failed to materialize. Later presentations included a fire-eater, a

            <p>Since excellent stage performances could be witnessed regularly by the people of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, there was small incentive for much activity of the local amateur dramatic societies.
                    Much more interest in the professional stage was evident. Travelling theatrical managers reported
                    that they found more stage-struck girls in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> than in any other city of similar size in the country. From one to a dozen applications
                    for positions were received by each company appearing there. The girls were attracted by the glamor
                    of the stage, unaware of its temptations and hard life.<hi rend="sup">74</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What proportion of those who sought fame and fortune on the stage actually found it cannot be
                    determined. Yet several were reported to be under contract to various companies. Of this number some
                    came from families of good social background. This in itself is worthy of note in view of the early
                    attitude toward the theater. By the 1890's, one who had dramatic talent could become a
                    professional actress without losing social standing. An outstanding example was Kate Tousey, wife of
                    Austin W. Morris, who was reported under contract to the Willow Copse Company in 1885. Both husband
                    and wife were also active in local dramatics. Kate Fletcher, sister of Mrs. Thomas B. Glessing,
                    played in the supporting cast with such actors as Joseph Jefferson, Lawrence Barrett, and Margaret
                    Mather. Lida Hood Talbott had an important role in a new play, <hi rend="i">On the Yellowstone</hi>,
                    which was produced in <placeName>

                    achieved on the stage by local persons. Variety theaters still encountered strong objection, but
                    opposition to the legitimate theater had largely disappeared by the close of the 1880's.
                    Such disapproval as was voiced by the clergy usually singled out a particular play or actress, such

                    socially and culturally, and dramatic art was well along the way toward designation as a fine art in <placeName>

            <p>Jacob W. Bartmess was one of approximately 200,000 Hoosiers who served in the Union forces during the
                    Civil War. When the war commenced he and his family were living at or near New Corydon, in
                    northeastern Jay County, near the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> line. His letters indicate that prior to the war he had apparently combined farming
                    with blacksmithing, while there are sufficient references in them to debts, the destitute
                    circumstances of his family, and the disposition of his army pay to indicate that his family had
                    apparently found it difficult to make "ends meet" even before Bartmess volunteered
                    for the conflict. The absence of the husband and father during nearly three years of war naturally
                    added much to the hardships of the family at home, which included his wife Amanda, a son Elliott,
                    and a daughter Elista.</p>
            <p>The letters which Bartmess wrote home do not reflect any enthusiasm for military service. In fact,
                    some of them strongly reflect his lack thereof, as well as the difficulties and unhappiness which he
                    endured. Moreover, he did not enter the war until the fall of 1862—about a year and a
                    half after it had begun—and then as a volunteer to be ahead of the draft.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> But such was not unique, even in the Civil War.</p>
            <p>Bartmess regarded war as a horrible ordeal and the army as a corrupt place where religious men were
                    very little noticed. But love of country, devotion to his family, and faith in God sustained him
                    despite some wavering and many doubts. Perhaps these letters are principally significant for their
                    forthright comments from a common soldier regarding war, politics, religion, loneliness, and related
                    items. In addition, there is much in them concerning the problems which his family faced on the home
                    front and the impact of the war on family relations.</p>

            <p>The author of these letters became a member of Company C, Eighth Cavalry, Thirty Ninth Regiment, on
                    October 12, 1862, and was mustered out of service on July 20, 1865.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> When the

                    </placeName>. Next he was at Camp Morton, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and thence to Camp Rosecrans, about seven miles south of <placeName>

                    induction he participated in the Battle of Murfreesboro or Stone River which occurred December 31,
                    1862-January 2, 1863. In this battle his regiment suffered heavy losses and Bartmess became a
                    Confederate captive.</p>
            <p>After being taken farther south he was sent to a parole camp near <placeName>

                    </placeName> when Union soldiers broke up a meeting addressed by Thomas A. Hendricks and other
                    Democrats. Bartmess described this affair in his letter of May 21, 1863, in which he called
                    "Tom'. Hendrix a rank butternut."</p>
            <p>Returning to the front he spent most of the remainder of that year in southeastern <placeName>

                    publication of his letters, covering the years 1864 and 1865. An attempt has been made to reproduce
                    the spelling, punctuation, and the like of the original correspondence, but at times the actual
                    intent of the author was uncertain. Only a few of the letters have not been used, while the
                    omissions for those published have been indicated. The omitted portions of the correspondence deal
                    principally with comments about religion, oft-repeated affirmations of love to his wife and
                    children, letters or items to the children, and routine or repetitious items. These letters were

                        <p>I am again in camp. I got here day before yesterday evening, and on the account of
                                    having a good orderly, there was nothing said about us going home. So all right. I
                                    have been bothered from sleeping considerably by the tooth ache. I Stood guard last
                                    night and did not get to sleep more than fifteen minutes, today is a beautiful warm
                                    day Well Amanda there is every thing going on here at the same time play cards,

                                    many in the guard house two of them robed a man in the guard house, and they took a
                                    couple of flour barrels and cut holes in the bottom big enough to Stick their heads
                                    through and then put them on them bottom upwards and marched them, with a guard at
                                    their side, around the camp all day yesterday and till midnight last night, and
                                    commenced again this morning. The talk is that they will be turned over to the civil
                                    authorities and then the[y] will be about ceartain to go to the Pen.</p>
                        <p>they are moving our camp over the canal a Short distance. We will be apt to move from
                                    here before you could send me a letter, but I will keep on writing and let you know
                                    when and where to write Now more at present, but to remain yours forever.</p>

                        <p>We got to camp yesterday, they have said nothing yet and I suppose they will not. We
                                    met our Leut. Col. Jones in <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                                    </placeName> day before yesterday, he told us that he would get us ready and take us
                                    to the Reg. yesterday, but he afterwards got news that the railroad was out of
                                    repair and that it would not be fixed for a few days and so we did not go. but he he
                                    Said that we would go the last of this week or the first of next.</p>
                        <p>We are now in camp Carrington we have tollerable good barrix there, are flores and
                                    Stoves in them but Still it is not like being in a good house.</p>
                        <p>I have the tooth ache Some again.</p>
                        <p>As we came down on the cars three miles this side of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>

                                    <pb n="52" id="VAA4025-052-1-062"/> we saw where a train of cars had run over a cow
                                    and run off the track the night before, there lay the locomotive on its Side all
                                    twisted and torn and two or three of the other cars in the same fix. I expect it
                                    will be no use to write to me untill you get another letter from me.</p>
                        <p>I Saw Eli Houser yesterday he said he had sent a letter home a day or two ago. he is

                                    cold today. A couple of Groves boys is here in camp, there is from 30 to 40 in the
                                    guard house here all the time for breaking guard and other things I got a pass to go

                        <p>I have been for the last few days and am at the present quite grunty. my Stomache is
                                    out of fix. I went to the doctor this morning and got a dose of oil; may be the oil
                                    will Settle it. The brigade went out on drill this morning but I did not go along.</p>
                        <p>I received your letter of the 11th. and 12th. yesterday evening, which gave me much
                                    Satisfaction. I received a letter from you about one week ago stating that you were
                                    sick., and O, how anxious every evening when the mail came, since that was I to get
                                    get a letter from you to hear how you was getting. I am sorry that you was sick but
                                    am glad of the change and hope you may get as well and stout as you ever have been.
                                    You Said that Elliott was very Mischevious. Tell him that papy says he must not be
                                    too bad and you may be sure that I would like to be there and take lista on my lap
                                    and talk to her and hear her talk Well my prayer is that the time may soon come.</p>
                        <p>You say you miss me when you go to bed Ah, dear Wife. When meal time comes, and I sit
                                    down on the ground, useing the ground for a table, and having on the table some hard
                                    crackers some old bacon, a coffee pot full of coffee, which pot is so black and hard
                                    looking that you would scarcely use it for a Slop pot at home, then pour my coffee
                                    into an old tin cup which would be a disgrace to the kitchen at home then I miss
                                    you. When I lie down on the ground at night with my overcoat for a pillow and my
                                    blanket for a cover heareing oath after oath till at last nature yealds and my eyes
                                    close in Sleep. O then I miss When I go about camp hearing the continual din of
                                    camp, there I miss you. where er'e I go in whatever company I am. I miss my
                                    dearest one—my wife.—</p>
                        <p>And my Children which I once thought troublesome, would now be a great delight to me
                                    even when they are most mischevious. I most earnestly pray that these stat of things
                                    will not last long.</p>
                        <p>As to what you can Send me. I can say I am out of money but I expect I can do without
                                    better here than you can there, and I do not expect you have it to spare, but if you
                                    should <pb n="57" id="VAA4025-052-1-067"/> have it to Spare you may send me a dollar
                                    or two. but do not send it unless you can spare it. If you can send me a couple
                                    pairs of socks it would be a help to me for these government socks are worth
                                    nothing. I would like if you would send me some yarn to darn socks with. S Hanly has
                                    a needle so that if I had the yarn I could darn my socks and make them last longer.</p>
                        <p>I would love to have yours and the childrens pictures taken in a double case and sent
                                    to me yours on one side and the childrens on the other, but it will cost too much,
                                    do just as you like about that. I am sorry to hear that the boys do not get along
                                    any better than they do. for I would like to have Harrison with me then I believe I
                                    would get along better. Tell the boys to write to me as often as they can. though I
                                    have not wrote to them, the letters that I send to you will do for the whole family.
                                    I believe I will close this letter. I think I have averaged two letters a week I
                                    wish you may do as well we have had nice dry wether here ever since I have been here
                                    Amanda I wish I could tell you how deep my affection is for you but I can not so

                        <p>it has been a long time since I had a chance to write to you. And I expect you have
                                    been very uneasy about me expecting I was killed, and tis a wonder I was not. I
                                    commenced to write a Christmas but did not get the letter finised. the next day we
                                    started to attack Murfreesboro it was a continnal Skirmish all the way which was
                                    about 30 miles. On the next Tuesday evening we were put on picket within 200 yards
                                    of of the rebels the rebels lay in heavy line of battle all night, while we had no
                                    line of battle at all. next morning just as soon as it was light enough to see the
                                    rebels made a charge on us our brigade had all their guns Stacked and not loaded So
                                    the rebels had them all cut up befor they got they guns, here come the rebels on us
                                    pickets ten regiments Strong So the only thing that we could do was to surrender or
                                    run. So we started and done what shooting we could as we went, and the bulletts
                                    whizing around us all the way I got about three miles and was taken prisoner <pb n="58" id="VAA4025-052-1-068"/> by the cavalry, was taken back to Murfreesboro
                                    and paroled next morning Started on the cars for Vicksburge. and got very near to

                        <p>I write to you today because I feared that you would think hard of me for not
                                    writing. I would have written sooner but we have expected our money every day for a
                                    week past, and I did not want to write untill we were paid but as we have not got
                                    our money yet I thought I would write this morning. I have nothing of importance to
                                    write. I saw D. Skinner yesterday he says that there is no chance for a deal detail
                                    that he knows of. My health has been, since I left home last, with the exception of
                                    the last two days, nearly as good as it ever was. I do not feell quite as well now.
                                    I have the diarrhoea some. I received your letter yesterday I am sorry to hear that
                                    Elliott, was sick. Amanda <pb n="60" id="VAA4025-052-1-070"/> take good care of him.
                                    which of course you will. O Amanda I am so discontented here. I see nothing but
                                    foolishness and drunkenness, and hear nothing but swearing. If we are not exchanged
                                    soon I will spend the time untill I am exchangeg at home furlough or no furlough.</p>
                        <p>I Send you a couple of rings which I want you to weare as from your husband Captain
                                    Crowell is exchanged and was here to see us.</p>
                        <p>How glad I would be to have this war to end so that we as a little family could spend
                                    happier days hereafter than we have heretofore May the great God. grant us the
                                    blessing soon.</p>

                                    we were paid today up to the first of March. I received $.58,90. and I

                                    dollar. So I keep $17.00. dollars If I find I can get along without that
                                    much I will send you more.</p>
                        <p>Now Amanda remember the wants of yourself and children first, and then the debts.</p>
                        <p>I do not know how long we will stay here, may be till next week only, and may be two

                        <p>I have nothing more to write at this time but as ever remain</p>

                        <p>I had intended to write yesterday, so that you would get this letter yesterday. But
                                    we were called out night before last, to the arsnel in town, to guard it.</p>
                        <p>The butternuts had a great convention in the state house yard yesterday. And the
                                    military authorities were affraid that they would make an attempt to get the arms
                                    out of the arsnel. So we stayed in the arsnel untill this morning. Yesterday while
                                        <pb n="61" id="VAA4025-052-1-071"/> Tom'. Hendrix a rank butternut was
                                    making his great effort, in his speach. some one hurahed for Jef Davis Six or eight
                                    Soldiers made a charge to get him but failed, they then made a charge on the
                                    speaker, and he jumped off the stand and run for life, his friends kept between him
                                    and the soldiers so that they did not get him. they croweded so thick after him that
                                    they tore the board fence down, but that was the last of Tom Hendrix. then the
                                    Butternut meeting turned to a Union meeting. Since I commenced writing this letter I
                                    received a letter from you dated the 17th. inst and am sorry to hear that the
                                    smallpox is in the neighborhood. O. how anxious I will be to know how you get along
                                    now till it is over.</p>
                        <p>There is some talk that we will leave for the <hi rend="i">Reg.</hi> next monday but
                                    I do not know how it will be.</p>
                        <p>My health is still good, and I am not a little glad of it either. Hoping that you
                                    will write often.</p>

                                    </placeName> about 1. O,clock at night. We started from there at eight O,clock next
                                    morning for <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, and arrived about one houre by sun.</p>
                        <p>We came out to the reg't today.</p>
                        <p>We found the boys well, and enjoying soldiering with horses in high glee, they are
                                    just now starting out on drill. Our camp is not far from where the rebels made the
                                    charge on us the morning that we were taken prisoner.</p>
                        <p>Amanda—such a time as we had on leaving <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                                    </placeName> you never saw. at least half were drunk, they had several fights. and
                                    quite a number came away with bruised faces and black eyes.</p>
                        <p>Well Amanda—one thing I must say for A. Mason that he is as good a union
                                    man now as there is in the reg't he says let the negros be freed if that
                                    will save the union anyhow he despises this thing of buying and selling human flesh,
                                    he sends his respects to Harrison. There is prospect of another fight. But our men
                                    are so fortified that the rebels have not men enough to take the place. Apples and
                                    peaches are going to be plenty down here, and I assure you that we will have our
                                    share. …</p>

                        <p>Amanda let me assure you that this place bears the marks of battle. Where once stood
                                    the nice dwelling of the rich planter and the negro huts, and the good fencing which
                                    enclosed the large rich farm and separated it into fields, now is a vast ruin, there
                                    are no houses, no negro huts, no fencing. One vast desolation exists for many miles
                                    around. The trees are wonderfly marked with minie-balls. Some of them from the <pb n="63" id="VAA4025-052-1-073"/> thickness of my body down are entirely cout down
                                    with canon balls. But what is more: the many little boards which stick in the ground
                                    in regular rotation, marking the spot where lies the boddies of of hundreds of our
                                    brave men. who fell a sacrifice on their countries, altar on stoneriver's
                                    boody field. My thoughts ask me where are the many little orphans calling and crying
                                    for pappy, while his body is mouldering in this vast grave yard. And where is that
                                    widowed, and heartbroken wife, who when the question is forced on her mind where is
                                    my husband? and the answer comes that he fell and was hurried by careless hands on
                                    stonerivers battle field. Writhes in desperate and indescribable anguish. O. who
                                    will answer for the sin of this most dreadful and calamitous war. but why should I
                                    continue thus. God bless the right.</p>

                        <p>We are now in camp at Winchester, a little town about four miles in the rear of the
                                    camp that I wrote from the other time. It has been 17 days since we left
                                    Murfreesboro It has been quite a hard trip. Our supply train just came up to us
                                    yesterday evening the first that we have seen of it for nearly two weeks, nearly all
                                    that time we have had to live off the country We would go out foreageing as we call
                                    it. and where ever we could find any corn we would take it for our horses, and then
                                    go in the smokehouses and take hams and shoulders or side meat or any thing that
                                    could be found to eat. chickens, geese, turkeys, hogs, and cattle were taken very
                                    freely. We had to get corn meal werever we could for bread. I got three plugs of
                                    tobacco at Tullahoma each about one foot long, which did me very good service. I
                                    traided some of it to the <hi rend="i">101st <placeName>
                                            <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                                        </placeName> reg't.</hi> for crackers and in this way kept in something
                                    to eat.</p>
                        <p>There are a great many black berrys here and the largest ones you ever seen. A lot of
                                    us went out yesterday and got all that we wanted to eat. and brought some to camp.
                                    Well Amanda you ought to see us go into oats fields and meadows with our horses. I
                                    tell you, you would see oats and grain suffer, and wheat fields that have the wheat
                                    cut and shocked we go into and carry out the wheat to feed, and make beds to sleep
                                    on. I tell you that the country is perfectly ransacked We have stirring news here
                                    now. but I expect you have heard it all. The boys are in good spirits, thinking that
                                    the war will close this sumer.</p>
                        <p>We have taken quite a number of prisoners, many of them came and gave themselves up
                                    and have taken the oath of allegiance and some of them have enlisted to fight for
                                    the union, they say that there are any amount that would desert the rebel army if
                                    they had a chance.</p>

                        <p>Your kind letter of the 29th of June came to hand two days ago. You spoke of the
                                    frost hurting our wheat some. Amanda that is not as bad as some of the wheat is hurt
                                    here, for we go into the fields that are cut and haul it all to camp and feed it to
                                    the horses. I hope that Morgan has served some of the butternuts so in Ind.
                                    … The news is very encouraging here now. it is to be hoped that the war
                                    will end this summer. The health of the Soldiers here is generaly good except the
                                    diarrhoea, which was caused by having to eat so much fresh meat. There is no end to
                                    blackbaries here, a part of our reg't goes out every day blackberrying. For
                                    the last week the weather has been very pleasant, but two weeks of the time since we
                                    left Murfreesboro. was as wet as I ever saw. I come very near loosing all my postage
                                    stamps.</p>
                        <p>My pens, which were in my pocket book, got so wet that they rusted so as nearly to
                                    spoil them, we have a very pleasant camp, and since we have been here, we have had
                                    very good times except a little short of rations, we have had no duty to do scarcly.
                                    but then we need a little rest. Some of the horses look awful hard, their backs have
                                    been sore so long that great holes are eat in them. …</p>
                        <p>Well Amanda paper is scarce here now and when we do get it we pay 5 cents for three
                                    sheets. Envellops is Still scarcer. I will close by Subscribing myself.</p>

                        <p>You wanted to know about my Socks, and eatables, With a little darning my socks will
                                    last a considerable while yet. We have piety to eat. Our eatables consists in
                                    crackers, bacon, beef, coffee, and sugar, beside this we get by foraging, fresh
                                    pork, chickens, potatoes, apples, and onions. I wish you <pb n="66" id="VAA4025-052-1-076"/> could have some of the coffee. I love coffee better
                                    than ever. I could almost drink it for a regular drink. Adam Mason is with me again,
                                    he was at the hospital nursing the wounded. He is one of the best fellows to bunck
                                    with, for if there is any thing to get to eat he will have it.</p>
                        <p>You ought to hear him talk about butternuts at home, no man can hate them worse than
                                    he does.</p>

                        <p>You will see by the heading of this letter that we have moved to another place. We
                                    are now in camp some 15 miles from Winchester, toward Murfreesboro right on the <placeName>

                                    that Harrison remembers the place.</p>
                        <p>We was in camp at Winchester, we had a fine time. There was a Soldiers prayre meeting
                                    in town every night, and on Sundays there were two church houses used for meeting.
                                    And there we had no duty to do, here there is a detail of 8. out of our company
                                    every day for vidette duty. Harrison will explain that to you.</p>

                        <salute>Dear Companion—.</salute>
                        <p>I wrote you a a letter yesterday, and after writing received one from you dated the
                                    2n inst, Which I thought best to answer this moring. It is strange how the report
                                    was started that Adam and me was killed, and I do expect that you felt bad when you
                                    heard it, but felt better when you found it was not so. You spoke of Abe writing
                                    home to pap as he did. I glory in Abe's spunk I hope that he will live up
                                    to it and let them know that he hates butternuts and their friends too. I tell you
                                    that there are few soldiers in the field who has not learned to hate butternuts.</p>
                        <p>You next spoke of sending me paper and envellopes in every letter. Amanda that is no
                                    use we have plenty of paper and envelops here, and then what you did send is so
                                    rinkled up that it could scarcely be written on at all. if you could send me a few
                                    stamps once in a while it would suit me verry well.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the blacksmith tools you may sell them the first chance you get. sell them
                                    if you cannot get more than twenty dollars for them, for I expect to follow
                                    something else after I get out of the service.</p>

                        <p>It affords me great pleasure, to write to you again. I expect you have been made
                                    uneasy by not receiving a letter <pb n="68" id="VAA4025-052-1-078"/> from me for
                                    some time. I commenced to write you a letter last sunday but before I got it
                                    finished the orders came to march, so I had to lay by my writing, and get ready. We
                                    are now in camp at the above named place, which is about two miles from the Tenn.
                                    river, something near 30 miles below Bridgeport. I do not know how long we will stay
                                    in this camp, but likely a few weeks.</p>
                        <p>I received a letter from <placeName>
                                        <country reg="is">Israel</country>
                                    </placeName> Macklin he says that the democrats just wear the butternuts because the
                                    Abolitionists call them butternuts, he says that he never wore any. but if any body
                                    dares to wear one, with a threat to take it off. he says he will wear it and show
                                    them that they cannot take it off.</p>

                                    </placeName>, it would not pass here, but it was good there. The citizens, nearly
                                    all left this town before we come in and went across the river.</p>
                        <p>This is a nice camping ground, and Adam and P. S. Bodle. and I have a nice tent up to
                                    sleep in we have plenty to eat. It beats all for peaches here among these mountains

                        <p>having an opportunity. I thought it best to write you a few lines. We left camp at
                                    Bellfont yesterday, and have just crossed the <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                                    </placeName> river not far from Stephenson, on a pontoon bridge. We are now in camp
                                    about % of a mile from the river. But I expect we will not stay longer than
                                    tomorrow. Our men crossed the river without any opposition. It is reported that
                                    Bragg has taken all the large guns from chattanooga to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Atlanta</settlement>
                                    </placeName> Geo. Three companys of us came in off of a three days scout day before
                                    yesterday We brought in 27 citizens and soldiers together, they all took the oath of
                                    allegiance, and went home, some of them had been in the <pb n="69" id="VAA4025-052-1-079"/> rebel service two years, they deserted, and say that
                                    they believe that the rebel army will go down by desertion if nothing else. We lived
                                    well while we was on the scout. I had several good meals from the citizens, which
                                    cost me nothing. …</p>

                        <p>We are in camp 25 miles south of the <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                                    </placeName> river and about 30 or 40 miles west of <placeName>

                                    </placeName>. Our reg't was about 22 miles further south at a town called
                                    Trenton Thomas' corps is there. We are in the valey between sand mountain
                                    and lookout mountain in the State of <placeName>

                                    </placeName>. We are likely to leave here soon. I think that Rosencrans is trying to
                                    surround Bragg, and if Bragg is yet at chattanooga, he has nearly done it.</p>
                        <p>Deserters continue to come to our lines, they give a sad statement of the condition
                                    of the rebel army. I heard a very intelligent one say that the rebellion must go
                                    down soon, that they positively have scarcely any thing to eat. that the soldiers
                                    are all discouraged and dead in spirits, he says that they will not fight much, he
                                    says that they are sitting around in camp in little groups ploting how to desert, he
                                    says that the officers watch around and arrests all that they think are talking
                                    about such things.</p>

                        <salute>Dear Wife—.</salute>
                        <p>It may seam strange that I should head my letter at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. There was a lot of the new recruits and some of the old soldiers,
                                    amounting to about two hundred in all. sent here after horses, and the prospect is
                                    fair to stay here a while, there being no horses here at this time. We arived here
                                        <pb n="70" id="VAA4025-052-1-080"/> yesterday evening, and have taken up
                                    quarters in the old Zolicoffer house. The talk is that we will have to do guard duty
                                    while we are here. I know that you must have been uneasy for some time past, on
                                    account of not receiving more letters from me. but there has been but few times that
                                    I could send letters for a long time now. and just once in a while that any mail
                                    come to the reg't. Dear Wife I know that such things cause us trouble but
                                    they can not be helped, and it is to be hoped that they will not last long. I have
                                    nothing new to write to you, for nothing has occured since I wrote you last, My
                                    health is very good at this time Our trip down here was very uncomfortable on accout
                                    of it having rained for several days before before we started, and we had 35 miles
                                    to walk before we got to the rail road! it has been quite wet for some time.</p>

                        <salute>Dearest one—.</salute>
                        <p>It is sabbath, and we are in this large unfinished brick house, no glass in the
                                    windows, and it is very uncomfortably cold. To be sure we have a stove in the room
                                    but half the time no wood. The consequence is I have a severe cold and feel somewhat
                                    unwell. I have written you one letter allready since we are here, but for fear that
                                    you did not get it, I will again say that we are here for 300 horses and 160
                                    saddles. … the talk is that the reg't is coming here too, I do
                                    not know whether it is so or not. This is a dreadful place. Our cooking is done for
                                    us. at breakfast we get cold boilt beef bread, and coffee that is not fit to drink,
                                    for dinner we get beans bread and coffee for supper we get cold boilt side meat,
                                    bread and coffee, if we have money we can buy milk butter and a great many other
                                    good things.</p>
                        <p>I would like to know how you are getting along for eatables, for I will be satisfied
                                    on this kind of fair, so I know that my little family has plenty. We have to stand
                                    picket here which however we are glad to do in order to get out of this house into
                                    the open air.</p>

                        <p>Well here we are pent up in this dirty, lousy house. When we go to get. a meal we
                                    have to go down two pair of stairs, and then stand at the door a half hour or more
                                    before we can crowd in There are so many in here that it takes about all the time
                                    from 4 o'clock in the morning till 9 o.clock at night to get three meals.
                                    It is a hard place to stay. I would rather be with the reg't. then I would
                                    get letters once in a while from home, here I will get none unless they are directed
                                    to this place We are on duty here about every other day, picket guarding a wagon
                                    train into the country after wood or hay, or something of the kind, but still that
                                    is not hard work, we are glad to get out into fresh air. There are many things that
                                    I can tell you when the happy day comes to come home, which I do not wish to write.
                                    I tell you Amanda there are many things transpire here, which utterly confound me.
                                    things which will make any feeling man shudder.</p>

                        <p>There is four months pay coming to us now. I would like to know whether you get all

                        <salute>Dear Companion—.</salute>
                        <p>I have not had the privilege to write to you for two weeks, and I expect that you are
                                    getting uneasy, but I am glad to tell you that I am well. We left Nasville, last
                                    monday one week ago. and arrived here at steveson yesterday a distance of 113.
                                    miles, a part of it the worst roads that I ever seen, especially crossing the
                                    Cumberland mountains was beyond all description How long we may stay here is more
                                    than I can tell.</p>
                        <p>We were paid off on the way here I received as I thought at the time
                                    $.59,00 but upon examination next morning I had but $.49,00. I
                                    owed $9.00. for a watch that I bought at Winchester last summer, besides
                                    that I owed $.11.00. of borrowed money that I borrowed at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                                    </placeName> to get something good to eat. and I owed the sutler $.6.00
                                    for tobacco and paper and envellops and ink, &amp;c I am sorry to have to tell
                                    you such a tale, but almost any person that has been fed on crackers and fat bacon a
                                    long time will try to get something better when they can. If you think I done wrong
                                    I want you to forgive me. for I do not intend to owe any more while I am in the
                                    army.</p>
                        <p>after paying my debts I have but twenty dollars left, and no safe way to send any
                                    home, but Oh should you or any of my little ones need any thing before I can send
                                    you any money, how will I feel after spending so much of my money here. Dear Amanda
                                    do not think hard of me, and let me know whether you can get along till next pay day
                                    which will be as soon as the first of March. We have wet and cold weather which
                                    makes it very disagreeable I am bunking now with Calvin Burdy a teamster we have
                                    four blankets to sleep under and our overcoats and oil blankets to sleep on which a

                        <p>This is Christmas and I am seated in one room of an old vacated house, writing you a

                        <salute>Dear Wife—.</salute>
                        <p>This morning is full of the memories of the past, not memories of the bright and
                                    pleasant, but of whistleing bullets, and the wild maniac yell of the rebel hords as
                                    they came down upon us at stoneriver, just one year ago. At about this very hour
                                    (9.'o'c.) one year ago I was surrounded and taken a prisoner by
                                    the rebel cavalry.</p>
                        <p>This morning I am sitting in a very comfortable shanty built by the soldiers at the
                                    above named place, which is about two miles below Dallas I do not know how long I
                                    will stay here, the team is to go to Chatanooga. today for rations, but I have got
                                    another fellow to make the trip for me.</p>
                        <p>I must tell you of one mean trick that a fellow by the name of John Nidy played on me
                                    When I went to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                                    </placeName> I left my port folio with one dollars worth of paper and envelops in
                                    it. in the Cap't box. This Nidy is the Cap'ts cook, so he went to
                                    George Clark and told him that I told him <pb n="74" id="VAA4025-052-1-084"/> (nidy)
                                    that he sould take care of my port folio and use some of the paper if he wanted to.
                                    wich was all a lie and when I came back he had used up all of the paper and
                                    envelopes. I do think that he is the bigest liar that I ever knew. Yet he is the
                                    Captains pet. and such men are more apt to be called good soldiers than men of truth
                                    and honesty. It seams that all a man has to do in the army to be promoted and
                                    considered something is to use a heap of profane language and whiskey and be expert
                                    in playing cards. The army is a corrupt place, a place where religious men are very
                                    little noticed.</p>

            <p>Dorothy Riker, of the staff of the Indiana Historical Bureau; Irene Strieby, librarian of the Lilly

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>—have generously agreed to serve as editorial assistants for the genealogical
                    pages of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Miss Riker will serve as chairman of this informal committee which will act in a review and advisory
                    capacity concerning genealogical materials. Some items concerning genealogy will normally appear in
                    each issue of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> in accordance with the practice of
                    previous editors. Correspondence concerning genealogical items should be addressed to the Editor,

                    </placeName>, Indiana.</p>
            <p>In general, material concerning genealogy will be selected in terms of the following considerations:
                    (1) It must in one way or another be related to Indiana topics or families. (2) Contributors must
                    accept responsibility for its accuracy and be willing and able to give adequate evidence that
                    accurate copy has been supplied. (3) Genealogical accounts about particular families will normally
                    not be published unless they have historical value because of the achievements of members thereof or
                    because they illustrate population movements, origins, and the like. (4) An effort will be made to
                    publish articles and records of general interest and value to both genealogists and historians. (5)
                    Queries about particular families or individuals will, unless the requests become too numerous, be
                    published once without charge, but their maximum length should normally not exceed 25–50
                    words.</p>

            <p>This volume is not a formal biography of Theodore Dreiser. It is rather a compilation of articles of
                    criticism, comment, and personal reminiscence, selected from various books and periodicals and early
                    newspaper reviews, covering a period of more than fifty years—from 1900 to the present
                    day. Among the twenty-five contributors are some of the leading authors and literary critics of the
                    first half of the twentieth century, including Stuart Sherman, Sherwood Anderson, Henry L. Mencken,
                    Sinclair Lewis, Francis O. Matthiessen, Malcolm Cowley, and Lionel Trilling.</p>
            <p>There is considerable biographical data scattered through the selections. Theodore Dreiser was born
                    in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, in 1871, and spent the first seven or eight years of his life in that city.
                    It seems to have been a rather drab existence. He knew poverty and degradation at first hand. The
                    family was a large one of German-American extraction, Roman Catholic in religion. He came to hate
                    his improvident father and to pity his mother. His education was obtained first in parochial
                    schools, then in the public schools of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Warsaw</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, where the Dreisers lived for a number of years, and at Indiana University for
                    a period of one year. This was in the late eighties when David Starr <placeName>
                        <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
                    </placeName> was president, Joseph Swain professor of mathematics, and Amzi Atwater professor of
                    Greek and Latin. He said that he derived much physical benefit from his year at the university but
                    through his own fault little mental stimulation. There followed several years as a newspaper
                    reporter and magazine writer in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>

                    </placeName>, and other cities. In 1896, in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, he assisted his older brother, Paul, a popular song writer, in composing <hi rend="i">On the Banks of the <placeName>
                            <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                        </placeName>
               </hi>, which was later to become the Indiana state song.</p>
            <p>Dreiser's first novel, <hi rend="i">Sister Carrie</hi>, appeared in 1900. It immediately
                    encountered difficulties because of an attempt <pb n="84" id="VAA4025-052-1-094"/> upon the part of
                    the publishers to suppress its sale. The way had been prepared for such a realistic work by the
                    fight for realism led by William Dean Howells, but this novel went far beyond anything undertaken
                    before, into the realm of naturalism, with which Howells would have no part. In short, Dreiser broke
                    completely with the English tradition of gentility. It is rather significant, in view of this fact,
                    that he secured his first recognition as a writer in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> where <hi rend="i">Sister Carrie</hi> was published in 1901, and highly praised in the
                        <hi rend="i">Daily Mail</hi> and in such a critical publication as the <hi rend="i">Athenaeum.</hi> The book was the forerunner of a veritable deluge of novels in the
                    1920's—a literature of disillusionment, frustration, defeat, despair, and
                    tragedy. It had its place in perhaps arousing people from their complacency. The worst that can be
                    said about this literature is that it held out no hope. There was little that was really
                    constructive about it. Man was but a helpless pawn in an all-determining environment. He was reduced
                    to the law of the jungle. Life had little purpose or meaning. Dreiser published no more novels until
                    1911, when they began to appear in rapid succession. <hi rend="i">An American Tragedy</hi>, termed
                    by Herbert G. Wells one of the great novels of the century, was published in 1925.</p>
            <p>Impressed by what he saw in Russia on a visit to that country in 1927, Dreiser later became a
                    Communist. Meanwhile, he turned against his father's orthodox religion and became an
                    atheist. It was in part a reaction from rigid dogmas he had come to associate with Christianity in
                    his boyhood. He was also greatly influenced in his early twenties by the reading of Herbert <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Spencer</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Thomas Huxley, and John Tyndall, as were many other young men of that day.</p>
            <p>Dreiser died in 1945. His writings soon became extremely unpopular. His Communist beliefs certainly
                    did not contribute to his popularity. Moreover, a new genteel tradition was ushered in. The
                    literature of protest with which he was so closely identified was no longer the fashion. He remains
                    to this day a controversial figure, and in many ways not an admirable one, yet a writer who must be
                    reckoned with in any history of modern American literature. The articles in the volume under review
                    reflect the varying opinions concerning the man and his work. They are on the whole favorable but
                    not all of them. Stuart Sherman, for <pb n="85" id="VAA4025-052-1-095"/> example, refers to the
                    "barbaric naturalism" of Dreiser. Sherwood Anderson, on the other hand, defends
                    him in his portrayal of the rough, ugly side of modern industrial society. After all, this was a
                    part of America. If his writing is unpleasant, there is much in American life which is unpleasant.
                    Sinclair Lewis went all out in his Nobel Prize acceptance in 1930, in defending him against attacks
                    by Henry Van Dyke and other representatives of the genteel tradition who were trying in the words of
                    the speaker "to guide America into becoming a pale edition of an English cathedral
                    town." "Dreiser," continued Lewis, "more than any other man, is
                    marching alone. Usually unappreciated, often hounded, he has cleared the trail from Victorian
                    Howellsian timidity and gentility in American fiction to honesty, boldness, and passion of life.
                    Without his pioneering I doubt if any of us could, unless we like to be sent to jail, seek to
                    express life, beauty and terror" (pp. 111–112).</p>
            <p>Americans who especially prize our English heritage and who cling to the older American tradition of
                    literature, which is in reality the English tradition, have little patience for Dreiser and his
                    like. Other Americans, thinking more in terms of a new chaotic America with its mixed population,
                    applaud him, painful as much of his writing is, because they believe he expresses this new America.
                    They look upon him as the outstanding leader in what has been called "the great
                    liberation"—"the new freedom" in American literature. Not many
                    readers will be changed in their point of view by this volume. None the less, the editors have
                    rendered a valuable service by bringing together in convenient form in a single volume the divergent
                    views of many writers and critics relative to a very prominent name in American literature of the
                    early decades of the twentieth century.</p>
            <p>One of the most valuable portions of the book, for those who might desire to pursue the subject
                    further, consists of a selected bibliography of Dreiser biography and criticism, thirty-three pages
                    in length, classified under the heading of "General" and "Book Reviews
                    and Notices" of the author's more important works.</p>
            <p>The volume has no index, something which was missed by the reviewer when he wished to look up certain
                    points. This, however, is a minor criticism in view of the general excellence of the book.</p>

            <p>In August of 1833, the Black Sparrow Hawk, a Sauk warrior more commonly known simply as Black Hawk,
                    informed Antoine Le Claire that he wished to dictate his autobiography to him. Le Claire, who was an
                    interpreter for the Sauk and Fox Indians, accordingly wrote down Black Hawk's oral account,
                    and John B. Patterson, a Galena newspaper editor, polished the narrative which was published at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> that same year. Several other editions followed, but Donald Jackson, an editor with the
                    rank of associate professor at the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> Press, has chosen the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> edition as being the most accurate and reliable. From time to time aspersions have been
                    cast upon the authenticity of the autobiography, but Jackson concludes that the account is genuine
                    although much of Black Hawk's language was changed or polished by Patterson.</p>
            <p>In editing Black Hawk's narrative, Jackson has not only carefully footnoted the original
                    text but has also contributed a thirty-eight-page introduction which traces Black Hawk's
                    life after his capture and gives a brief history of the Black Hawk War. Although this summary
                    contains few new facts about the war, it is written from original source material, as are the
                    footnotes. Throughout the volume there is much evidence of painstaking research and insight into the
                    problems which faced Black Hawk and his band.</p>
            <p>Black Hawk, the leader of the so-called British Band of Sauk and Fox, related that he was born at
                    Saukenuk near the mouth of the Rock River in the year 1767. His birth occurred just a few years
                    after the Sauk and Fox had settled at this site, which is now occupied by <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. When the French first came into contact with the Sauk and Fox Indians, they were
                    living in the vicinity of Green Bay, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>, but gradually they migrated to the Fox River, then to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>, and proceeded down the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> to the Rock River. This was their largest settlement, although there were other
                    villages on both sides of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>. As the Illini Indians were gradually pushed into southern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, the Sauk and Fox appropriated their lands. These eighteenth-century invaders were a
                    warlike people and one of the few tribes who never had cordial relations with the French.</p>
            <pb n="87" id="VAA4025-052-1-097"/>
            <p>At about the age of fifteen Black Hawk became a brave by wounding an enemy. Soon after this both
                    Black Hawk and his father, Pyesa, joined a war party that marched against the Osage, a Siouan tribe
                    then living on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> River and a competitor for the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> hunting grounds. Black Hawk killed his first enemy on this occasion and upon his return
                    to Saukenuk was permitted to join in the scalp dance. Fired with both a hatred for the Osage and a
                    desire to become a great warrior, Black Hawk later raised several successful war parties. While on
                    an expedition against the Cherokee, however, Pyesa was killed and Black Hawk assumed the role of
                    leader and "now fell heir to the great <hi rend="i">medicine bag</hi> of my
                    forefathers" (p. 55). Although Pyesa claimed descent from a chief, he did not hold that
                    office; rather he seems to have been one of the medicine men of the Sauk. Nor was Black Hawk
                    formally recognized as a chief, but as a hereditary medicine man he exerted much influence in his
                    tribe.</p>

                    </placeName> in return for an annual payment of $1,000. But as the settlers pushed into

                    and thereafter were called the British Band. At the conclusion of the war, the British Band refused
                    to sign a treaty of peace, and gradually relations with the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

                    Hawk again returned and was determined to stay at the old village or die defending it.</p>
            <p>Governor John Reynolds quickly called out the militia and implored the <placeName>

                    </placeName> government for federal aid. The Winnebago Prophet had promised Black Hawk support, but
                    few of the Winnebago joined him. It soon became apparent to Black Hawk that there was no retreat

                    </placeName>, tired of frontier incidents, was bent on destroying his <pb n="88" id="VAA4025-052-1-098"/> band. The Indians moved up the Rock River into <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> and attempted to cross the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> at a point near the Bad Axe River. They were surrounded by troops and slaughtered while
                    swimming or attempting to gain the water. A few of the Indians succeeded in crossing the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>, and Black Hawk escaped only to be captured by a party of Winnebago and delivered to

                        <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>

                    leaders were held in prison for a while and then released. After a tour of the East, Black Hawk took
                    up his residence near the <placeName>

            <p>Jackson's work is certainly the definitive edition of Black Hawk's autobiography.
                    The format, designed by Ralph Eckerstrom, and the printing, done at the Print Shop of the University

                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, are both excellent examples of fine bookmaking. If there is a criticism of the book,
                    it is that Jackson did not use the large collection of William Clark Papers at the <placeName>

                    Band. For example, they help to explain why Black Hawk, ranking only as a medicine man and brave,
                    was able to exert so much influence over this band in the spring of 1832. The recognized chiefs,
                    Black Thunder, Na-Moctt, and Ioway, had all died in 1831. (Felix St. Vrain to William Clark, <placeName>

               <hi rend="i">Culture on the Moving Frontier.</hi> By Louis B. Wright. (<placeName>

            <p>One of the perennial problems of American history is to explain the differences between the European
                    and the American. The major difference is in culture, although that word can have many shades of
                    meaning. To use the word "culture" to describe conditions on the American frontier
                    is perhaps a misuse of the word, yet there was definitely no cultural vacuum, once the European
                    immigrants reached that outer rim of civilization which is usually meant by the word frontier.
                    Frederick Jackson Turner tried to explain the <pb n="89" id="VAA4025-052-1-099"/> great distinctions
                    of the Americans by the influence of the frontier, but the frontier in his original use implied that
                    the vacuum did exist and that the European had to go as it were through this vacuum to emerge from
                    it an American. Everett Dick seems to be the only one who really tried to prove this extreme thesis
                    of a decline to savagery in his <hi rend="i">Vanguard of the Frontier</hi> (1941). Louis Wright is
                    really using the word "culture" in the better sense as that which flowers in
                    civilization; and he tries in these lectures to show that there were always elements of this old
                    civilization on the English American frontier and that the pioneers were engaged in a constant
                    struggle to increase and to intensify this culture.</p>
            <p>The culture on the frontier which he makes the subject of his study is that of the eastern seaboard,
                    especially that of New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. He correctly assumes that any culture or civilization worthy of the name would be the
                    English culture in a country that is definitely English-speaking. He takes it for granted that the
                    necessary agents of that culture were the towns and the libraries of the pioneers. In the south
                    where towns were few the aristocracy had to have a personal or family library. There were books in
                    surprising numbers on all English frontiers. In nearly every part of the frontier the desire to
                    perpetuate among the children of the pioneers their religious and political faiths was the chief
                    incentive to maintain as much as possible of older cultural patterns which the settlers had learned
                    in the lands from which they came.</p>
            <p>Wright has given a simple straightforward account in which his purpose is very evident.
                    Unfortunately, he seems to have printed his spoken discourse without reorganization; the spoken
                    lecture adaptable to an audience is rather shallow on the printed page. Some of his illustrative
                    material, useful to relieve the strain of a long lecture, might have been eliminated. He has made an
                    excellent use of the printed materials on the history of the frontier, although he has made these
                    printed witnesses carry more proof than they should. In his desire to mark the progress of this
                    British Protestant culture he has brushed aside the many exceptions, and even understated the wide
                    divergencies of religion that developed on the frontier among the sects. Nevertheless, he has stated
                    in clear fashion the most important facts about the frontier and about the developments immediately
                    after the advance <pb n="90" id="VAA4025-052-1-100"/> of the frontier. This dominant American
                    culture is essentially the culture of <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> modified by frontier conditions. To develop this theme over the whole history of the
                    American frontier was too great a task for four lectures, however pleasant they were to hear; the
                    book suffers from this and from the fact that he has derived many of his ideas from secondary
                    sources. (This disappointment is realized only by reading the footnotes hidden in the back of the
                    book.) But he has spoken well on a theme that needs a more rigorous and more extended study by
                    American historians.</p>

                    $4.00.)</head>
            <p>Reversing the slogan of the famous wagon-makers, this attractively designed and illustrated volume
                    provides much less in scope and content than its title promises. Instead of the naturally expected
                    history of farm mechanization, the reader is presented with a smattering sketch of the career and
                    times of Jerome Increase Case and the industry which he founded. The book thus belongs to the genre
                    of promotive business histories, whether presented directly as such or under more general guise.</p>
            <p>Inevitably this sort of history does not lend itself to critical objectivity. J. I. C. seldom made
                    mistakes and when he did he invariably profited by them. Competitors were unfair in selling
                    practices, but, apparently, not the Cases. The prevailing tone is wholly in accord with the
                    conservative revisionist appreciative reappraisal of capitalists and capitalism.</p>
            <p>However, Holbrook's conservatism in matter is in sharp contrast to his aberrational manner
                    of presentation. In organization and expression he flouts elementary standards of composition to say
                    nothing of the accepted usages of historical writing. After the fashion of writers of popular
                    fiction, he separates the divisions of his narration merely by number, with no organizational
                    titles. This noncommittal arrangement, no doubt, has the advantage, in the author's design,
                        <pb n="91" id="VAA4025-052-1-101"/> of keeping the reader guessing as to what is coming next and
                    of giving the narrator free range to digress as far and wide as his fancies dictate, with the
                    apparent conviction that anything in the period could be related to the enterprise of the Cases.</p>
            <p>Thus the setting is made with a highly impressionistic survey of the westward movement and the
                    conclusion with a panoramic survey of the changes in American agriculture that suggests the old-time
                    farmers' institute "then and now" addresses. The extended account of the
                    family's horse-racing ventures—including the illogical observation that it was
                    preferable to gain fame as an owner of race horses rather than from the impatient remark attributed
                    to William H. Vanderbilt—was deemed pertinent for its advertising value. The apparent
                    purpose of retelling, less accurately and adequately than it had been related elsewhere, the story
                    of bonanza farming was apparently as a background for the extended use of agricultural machinery.
                    The section given to swindling salesmen was generously extended to include Bibles, sewing-machines,
                    and seeds, as well as farm machinery.</p>
            <p>These gratuitous ventures into general historical matters have involved inaccurate or erroneous
                    statements of which the following examples are typical. The Agricultural Society of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> is confused with the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Agricultural Society of a decade later. In spite of conclusive available evidence to
                    the contrary, the local legend of Jonathan B. Turner's "notable help" to
                    Justin Morrill is affirmed. Whatever its temporary utility, the Osage orange hedge was far from
                    being an "incomparable success." To characterize the Patrons of Husbandry as
                    "a sort of rural Masonic order" (pp. 12–13) is to do an injustice to
                    both organizations. Following an outmoded vogue of certain economic historians,
                    "revolutions" appear at every turn, including the gradual adoption of horse power
                    and the coming of dairying to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>!</p>
            <p>Form and phraseology exhibit journalese in the extreme. Vocations or avocations are used throughout
                    as titles. Thus on a single page, Solon Robinson is successively "Husbandman,"
                    "Prophet," "Agriculturalist" (reduced to the simpler
                    "Agriculturist" in a later chapter), and a little later,
                    "Agitator." Other leading characters are introduced as
                    "Industrialist," <pb n="92" id="VAA4025-052-1-102"/> "Farmer,"
                    "Inventor," "Horseman," and "Agronomist."
                    Emphasis is sought by such arbitrary capitalization as "Rush of Forty-nine."
                    Outside of a frontier joke book there is no place for such a descriptive effort as
                    "settlers in some Godforsaken place near the moon called the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>
                    </placeName> Country" (p. 4). The limit of metaphorical confusion would seem to be
                    approached in the boast that "Case's Agitator ran away with the cream of the
                    threshing-machine business" (p. 68).</p>
            <p>The so-called bibliography, in form and selection, is wholly indifferent to elemental standards of
                    research. Apparently the main source was the records of the company, but they are not described or
                    specifically cited. Other entries show a lack of familiarity and discrimination in sources and
                    special studies. Reynold M. Wik's key study of steam power, published in 1953, is listed
                    and quoted only in the unrevised manuscript. Leading studies, such as that of Leo Rogin, are not
                    included. Agricultural and trade journals are listed merely by title with no indication of the years
                    which were covered.</p>
            <p>In spite of the rambling organization and uncritical presentation, the book has much of interest in
                    its flickering sidelights on the organization and policies of a great industrial enterprise. The
                    founder and his company merited a serious and balanced study that would have been a distinct
                    contribution both to agricultural and business history. Unfortunately the main contribution of the

            <p>In these <hi rend="i">Memoirs</hi>, the late Will H. Hays gives a generally detailed and a frequently
                    repetitious account of his lengthy career first as a Republican leader and then as
                    "czar" of the film producers. Born in the coal-mining community of Sullivan,
                    Indiana, in 1879, the son of a prominent citizen who was a reasonably prosperous lawyer, his youth
                    was much unlike that normally experienced by local boys.</p>
            <p>Hays apparently became a lawyer, a Mason, a Presbyterian, and a Republican without the necessity for
                    much reflection or deep soul-searching. His boyhood atmosphere engendered respect for and an
                    appreciation of the "eternal <pb n="93" id="VAA4025-052-1-103"/> verities,"
                    supplying a firm and enduring conservative bent to his religious, economic, and political views. He
                    also acquired a strong flavor of Hoosier provincialism and a vigorous spirit of nationalism or
                    Americanism. In the main, Hays was a joiner, an organizer, a propagandist, an administrator, a
                    politician, a harmonizer, and the like. His <hi rend="i">Memoirs</hi> indicate his faith in the

                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> College, admitted to the bar, made a precinct committeeman, and cast his first vote. To
                    quote him: "The pattern was definitely set" (p. 48). From then until near the end
                    of World War I, he was principally engaged in practicing law with his father and in ascending the
                    Republican political ladder within Indiana. In 1904, he became county chairman; in 1906, head of the
                    state speakers bureau, a position he held until 1910; in the latter year, he became district
                    chairman, a post to which he was re-elected in 1912; in 1914, he became state chairman and served
                    until 1918 when he was elected national chairman.</p>
            <p>Hays deprecated the split in the Republican party in 1912, but he gave his wholehearted support to
                    Taft despite his personal fondness for T.R. He recounts with evident satisfaction his aid in helping
                    to reunite the Hoosier GOP, but useful as his version is, it is not by any means the whole story.
                    During part of World War I, he doubled as state chairman and as head of the state civilian defense
                    committee.</p>
            <p>Generally in these <hi rend="i">Memoirs</hi>, Hays assumes that political rivals, both factional and
                    partisan, are as sincere, honest, and patriotic as those who agree with him, but this assumption is
                    not inclusive enough to encompass President Wilson. According to Hays, this fellow Presbyterian
                    doomed the League of Nations and multiplied partisan conflicts because of his stubbornness,
                    inability or unwillingness to compromise, rank partisanship, and lack of political acumen, as well
                    as by his unwise and unnecessary participation in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> Peace Conference. His heavy assaults against Wilson, even though they at times hit at
                    vulnerable points, bear evidence of strong bias and an international mindedness perhaps more like
                    Hays of the 1940's than of Hays, the Republican national chairman. On the other hand,
                    though he was postmaster general under President Harding from 1919 until 1922, he <pb n="94" id="VAA4025-052-1-104"/> has relatively little to say of Harding as a man and almost nothing by
                    way of evaluating Harding's administration. Such neglect is disturbing since Hays was the
                    national chairman, and as a cabinet member doubtless could have added significant information and
                    relevant evaluations concerning Harding and his record. The <hi rend="i">Memoirs</hi>, however, do
                    recount with much satisfaction the reorganization of the postal department under Hays.</p>
            <p>Among the comprehensive and revealing portions of this volume are the chapters regarding
                    Hays' long service with the film producers which resulted in his being dubbed the
                    "czar" of the movies for the years from 1922 until 1945. He admits that conditions
                    in the industry were bad when he entered this field, but he often seems to be unduly optimistic
                    about the amount of progress attained. The frustrating and continuing problems arising from efforts
                    at industrial self-regulation are described in much detail, while the ease with which codes already
                    formulated were easily adapted to the NRA in the early days of the New Deal has its ironic twist.
                    His lobbying for free trade in films—even through conferences with F.D.R. and important
                    British officials—is recounted with the not surprising comment that such efforts brought
                    kidding from some of his Republican colleagues. The chapters about the film industry are replete
                    with items regarding its business operations, struggles for self-regulation, efforts to avoid both
                    private and governmental censorship, its personalities, its varied services and contributions during
                    World War II as well as its roles with regard to both entertainment and education.</p>
            <p>According to the publisher, this volume was completed shortly before Hays died in 1954. It bears
                    evidence of composite authorship, a process suggested by the acknowledgements in the foreword.
                    Unfortunately, sources, even those for the numerous quotations, are seldom indicated in such a
                    manner as to make verification possible in the usual manner. Nevertheless, there is abundant
                    evidence that Hays drew much from his diary and from an apparently voluminous collection of letters,
                    addresses, and miscellaneous records. These <hi rend="i">Memoirs</hi> will certainly be useful in
                    the writing of both state and national history, but perhaps the basic sources used in their
                    composition would be even more useful to historians than are these recollections.</p>

            <p>William Blount was a large land speculator in the early Southwest, the governor of the Territory
                    South of the River <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, and a member of the United State Senate. From the latter position he was expelled
                    because of involvement in foreign negotiations which seemed disloyal. The present volume, which is
                    the first thorough and critical biography of the man, replaces an earlier work by Marcus J. Wright
                    entitled <hi rend="i">The Life and Services of William Blount</hi> (1884).</p>
            <p>Although Blount is frequently thought of as a land speculator, his political career was by no means
                    insignificant. He was a member of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName> House of Commons in 1781, 1783, and 1784; of the state senate in 1788 and 1789; and of
                    the Confederation Congress in 1788 and 1789. He was a delegate to the Constitutional Convention of
                    1787 which drafted the Constitution of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and a member of the convention in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName> which ratified the Constitution. President George Washington appointed him Governor of
                    the Territory South of the River <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and Superintendent of Indian Affairs in the Southern Department in 1790, positions
                    which he held until 1796. He was president of the convention which formed the first constitution of
                    the state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName>. He then became one of the first members of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Senate from the new state. After expulsion from this body he was elected to the senate
                    of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> and was chosen speaker. Such achievements have led Thomas P. Abernethy to comment in
                    his volume, <hi rend="i">From Frontier to Plantation in <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                        </placeName>
               </hi>, "As long as [Blount] lived, he dominated directly or indirectly the
                    politics of the section in which he made his home" (p. 168).</p>
            <p>Masterson on the other hand presents a more minute picture of Blount, details of which are exceptions
                    to Abernethy's generalization. For instance Blount was defeated for re-election to the
                    Confederation Congress late in 1786 and on February 2, 1787, was defeated for the presidency of
                    Congress by Arthur St. Clair. Two years later he was defeated in his efforts to be elected <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Senator from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName>. After his expulsion from the Senate, July 7, 1797, <pb n="96" id="VAA4025-052-1-106"/>
                    he was able to effect his election to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> senate and to its speakership, but he was not able to control Governor John Sevier or
                    make himself governor. He and his brother, John Gray Blount, were able narrowly at various times to
                    avoid prosecution for financial irregularities.</p>
            <p>Masterson presents Blount as the big business man or speculator who ruthlessly swept aside political
                    principles as well as smaller men in his campaign for riches. Yet he relates many details of his
                    career which form exceptions to this generalization. Blount excelled chiefly in taking private
                    advantage of official position. His profits must have exceeded his losses, but he was generally
                    short of cash. He lost heavily from the failure of a partner, his firm was near bankruptcy in his
                    last days, his brother John Gray was indicted for "high crimes," and another
                    accomplice escaped prosecution after arrest in Natchez. No attempt was made by the author to
                    estimate the value of his estate after final settlement.</p>
            <p>On the whole Blount was a very successful territorial governor. He identified himself with the
                    territory. He sought to protect the people from Indian attack and to persuade the federal government
                    to obtain more land from the Indians in order that it might be available for settlement. It did not
                    disturb the people of the territory that he stood to profit as a result of his actions, for they too
                    would profit. During this period, he was also very astute in overcoming opposition by means of
                    concessions, a policy which tended to preserve unity in trying times.</p>
            <p>The author's style is suited to the subject, somewhat rugged in some of the early chapters,
                    but flowing and smooth in the period of Blount's greater prominence. Throughout the volume
                    the author is frank with his readers, presenting Blount as he was, not glossing over his offences.
                    Only at the very end does he succumb to the vice of biographers and picture his subject as a
                    statesman. The volume is a very successful piece of work. It fills a gap in the knowledge of the
                    early Southwest and adds a worthy volume to the already successful <hi rend="i">Southern Biography

            <p>This remarkable book presents a first-hand account of a neglected phase of American history. It is a
                    collection of letters which Norwegian immigrants wrote to relatives and friends at home about the
                    land of their choice. All the letters selected were written originally in Norwegian during the
                    period from the 1820's to the 1870's. While they represent a geographic spread
                    from coast to coast, most of them were written from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, the Middle West, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>. In the Scandinavian countries such letters were called "America
                    letters" and the impulse they generated among others to emigrate was diagnosed as
                    "America fever." These letters form a diary on a grand scale and are significant
                    for the image of America that they transmitted to the people of Norway. They are important, too, for
                    their revelation of immigrants as human beings with names, personalities, and all the attributes of
                    men and women living their lives amid change and struggle. These Norwegian "America
                    letters" will remind historians of the existence of similar source material in other
                    European countries, the study of which may well provide a fresh approach to our history. To
                    illustrate—Professor Blegen states that, as not one of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> letters translated from early Norwegian newspapers has so much as been cited in any
                    general work on the forty-niners, the story of the gold rush has not yet been fully told.</p>
            <p>The editor, dean of the Graduate School of the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName>, travelled to Norway, where he collected the letters from Norwegian families and
                    newspapers which frequently published "America letters." He made typewritten and
                    photostatic copies, which were ultimately deposited in their complete form either in the archives of
                    the Norwegian-American Historical Association at Northfield, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>

                    </placeName>. Arrangements were made to have the originals preserved in Norwegian collections.
                    Professor Blegen did more than edit this work. His chapter, "The Immigrant Image of
                    America," and his introductions to the various other chapters interpret and supplement the
                    stories told by the immigrants in a manner that will be welcomed by those concerned with this phase
                    of history.</p>
            <pb n="98" id="VAA4025-052-1-108"/>
            <p>The "America letters" were not confined to the rank and file of the immigrants. Ole
                    Munch Raeder, a distinguished jurist, visited the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in the 1840's to study the American jury system. His letters took the form of
                    a searching commentary on American life. Frithjof Meidell lived in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Springfield</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
               </placeName>, in the 1850's and saw the comic aspects of the American
                    West in an amusing manner. Cleng Peerson, the "Daniel <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Boone</region>
                    </placeName>" of the Norwegian migration, scouted the West for suitable places for his
                    countrymen to settle and later blazed their trail to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName>, and even to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName>. No single early letter writer, the editor reports, had more influence than Gjert G.
                    Hovland, whose hundreds of letters were published in Norway's newspapers.
                    Hovland's bright picture of America was essentially the one accepted by thousands who
                    sought ships to carry them to the New World. The immigrant letters also tell the story of Oleana,
                    which Ole Bull, the colorful Norwegian violinist, sought to establish in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> in 1852.</p>
            <p>For the most part the immigrants were people of little education, and land, work, and hardships bulk
                    large in their reports. While most of them were content in their new home, they soon discovered that
                    in America the hedges did not "consist of sides of bacon and tobacco" nor was it a
                    land filled with "little roasted piggies" that politely asked one to have some
                    ham. Many did not survive the ordeal of the Atlantic crossing of from six to fourteen weeks. Others
                    who travelled westward on the Erie Canal complained that they were crowded in the boats like pigs
                    and in general were treated like swine. They suffered from disease and from hard work done at a pace

            <p>It is a curious fact that no serious, full-length biography has ever been written of James A. Bayard,
                    an American statesman deserving of such attention not only for his own accomplishments but also
                    because he was the progenitor of a succession of Bayards prominent in national politics. The subject
                    has been literally crying for attention since 1913 when Bayard's papers were published in
                    the annual report of the American Historical Association, but Borden's book is the first
                    one to face the challenge.</p>

                        </placeName> Studies in the Social Sciences</hi> does not pretend to be much more than an
                    investigation <pb n="100" id="VAA4025-052-1-110"/> of Bayard's role in Congress, where he
                    was a forceful figure from 1797 to 1813, first as a brilliant spokesman for the majority party in
                    the House of Representatives, then as the virtual minority leader after the Republican revolution of
                    1800, and finally as a member of the futile handful of Federalists in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Senate. When he was the single representative from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> in the lower house, Bayard exerted much more influence than he later commanded as one
                    of the state's two senators, and it was therefore during the earlier period of his
                    political career that he really had a hand in molding American history. For this reason, if for no
                    other, Professor Borden's chapters on Bayard's championship of the Alien and the
                    Sedition Acts, his prosecution of the Blount impeachment, his dubious relations with John Adams and
                    Alexander Hamilton, and his vital agency in swinging the disputed election of 1801 to Jefferson are
                    the best in his book. The latter (Chapter VII, pp. 73–95) is, indeed, a model of careful
                    research and perspicacious analysis, suitable for special study in historiography courses. Professor
                    Borden rightly concludes that three charges sometimes made by historians—(1) that Aaron
                    Burr intrigued with the Federalists for their votes in the House of Representatives, (2) that Bayard
                    attempted to corrupt Republican congressmen while working for Burr's election, (3) that
                    Thomas Jefferson accepted Bayard's "terms" in order to become
                    President—rest upon evidence too flimsy to be accepted.</p>
            <p>Although this is primarily a portrait of the politician rather than of the man, the final estimate of
                    Bayard's Federalism rests upon his character, and character analysis is the weakest part of
                    Borden's book. Bayard remained a lifelong Federalist, but the kind of Federalist who could
                    bring himself reluctantly to make Thomas Jefferson President in 1801 and accept appointment to a
                    peace mission by James <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1813. Unlike the Essex Junto fanatics, Bayard tempered the tory side of his
                    Federalism enough to co-operate with a Republican administration for the good of his country, but
                    conversely, unlike John Quincy Adams, yielded enough of the nationalist in his Federalism to refrain
                    from changing parties altogether. Borden does not see this flexibility as a chink in the
                    Chevalier's armor. In his chapter on the rivalry between Bayard and Adams (Chapter XIII,
                    pp. 157–168), it is the latter who is placed on the defensive for going over to <pb n="101" id="VAA4025-052-1-111"/> the Republican camp while the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> senator is applauded, at least inferentially, for maintaining his allegiance to a
                    moribund and self-betrayed political organization. Yet the principles of the two men remained
                    theoretically the same. Borden is ingenious in explaining away the remarkable contradiction between
                    Bayard's admission in 1810 that sufficient cause for war with <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> existed and his insistence that no augmentation of the nation's minuscule
                    military forces was necessary. Equally requisite of logistical agility is the explanation of
                    Bayard's agreement to serve on the peace mission of 1813 with instructions that convinced
                    him it would fail while at the same time assuring his party associates that a practicable peace
                    might be expected. The Chevalier indubitably was <hi rend="i">sans peur</hi> but it might well be
                    questioned whether he was always and entirely <hi rend="i">sans reproche.</hi> Consistency, of
                    course, is not necessarily a virtue among public office-holders, but it might be, perhaps, among
                    authors. On one page Borden speaks of Bayard's political skill and discretion in balancing
                    himself between the Adams and Hamilton factions of his party (by writing denunciatory letters to
                    Hamilton while remaining ostensibly on friendly terms with Adams): on another (p. 7) he praises
                    Bayard's honesty in rejecting "the Machiavellian plan of Alexander Hamilton to
                    rebuild the Federalist party" (which was actually a typical failure to recognize one of the
                    few occasions when a Federalist leader ever grasped the realities of practical politics.) Nothing,
                    however, is so difficult as the justification of political maneuvering in the absence of any fixed
                    standards of conduct, and it must be admitted that Borden does not attempt to hide the
                    facts—the basis upon which each reader can form his own opinion is faithfully presented.</p>
            <p>In spite of a few annoying literary mannerisms (Bayard is referred to as "the
                    Delawarean" three times on p. 101) and several typographical errors, this is a well-written
                    and competently published book. Professor Borden manages to hold the reader's interest even
                    through the long synopses of Bayard's speeches. His work is founded upon an exhaustive
                    study of the sources, including some items, such as the Plumer papers and the local <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> collections, which have been generally neglected by historians. The only reference
                    which he seems to have overlooked is an unpublished master's thesis on "The
                    Political Career of James A, Bayard" by an Indiana <pb n="102" id="VAA4025-052-1-112"/>

                    emerge from his pages, nor is Bayard as a Federalist clearly revealed. Other biographies, and more
                    studies like the recent book by John A. Munroe, <hi rend="i">Federalist <placeName>

            <p>This volume is the result of prolonged and prodigious research in varied and almost limitless
                    documents that would deter all but the most determined from undertaking such a project. The results
                    are good; the materials are utilized effectively; and seventy-five years after the Southern Claims
                    Commission went out of existence we have a study of its operations.</p>
            <p>Klingberg's first chapter, "The Persistence of Unionism," should be read
                    by all who pretend to know anything about the Civil War, and it will be especially rewarding to
                    those who continue to be amazed each time a biography of a southern unionist appears and they
                    discover that they still have two fingers on which to count their little band of faithfuls. After
                    considering the closeness of the popular vote in the South in the elections of 1840, 1844, and 1848
                    and reminding his readers of the fact that a large number of the important planters were born in the
                    North, the author emphasizes the point that the unionist was often a man of property and influence
                    in his community. This meant that the pressures were great on him and that his convictions were
                    sorely tested by bond issues, impressment practices, and tax measures, as well as by numerous social
                    forces. Active resistance to the Confederacy, or neutrality, was more difficult than for the man of
                    little property living in the more remote areas. Even so, a large number remained loyal and
                    willingly <pb n="103" id="VAA4025-052-1-113"/> turned over to Federal authorities their
                    quartermaster and commissary supplies, which were accepted in the good faith that ready compensation
                    could be expected at the end of the war. However, by that time payment had been so restricted that
                    it had virtually reached the point of repudiation.</p>
            <p>Klingberg treats rather succinctly and with adequate skill the wartime handling of the claims
                    problem. Admittedly, it was a knotty one, and the practices seem to bear no particular relation to
                    logic or to equity. For example, under the law of July 4, 1864, a <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> unionist could file a claim as a matter of course, while a <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> unionist could not file even though he had been a member of the Union army! Nor was
                    guilt by association and guilt by residence set aside—nor the position of the southern
                    unionist clarified—by the decision in the Prize Cases. This decision seemed to say that
                    in civil war the power of the government over its rebellious citizens was greater than over alien
                    enemies, since in the former instance the government also possessed the power to confiscate property
                    and to punish for treason. The activity of the Court of Claims is reviewed briefly. The jurisdiction
                    of this tribunal was so limited, however, that for almost six years after the war there was no means
                    of redress for most of those in the seceded states who had risked life and property for the Union
                    cause.</p>
            <p>The question of compensation for those southern unionists was caught up in the Liberal Republican
                    movement with the major discussion centering around the responsibility and ability of the government
                    to pay, the proper agency for judging claims, the problems of evaluation, and the definition of
                    loyalty. The measure for the commission was passed on March 3, 1871; one week later the three-man
                    commission had been appointed and approved. No claim could be received after March 3, 1873; on that
                    day 1,282 were filed. In the two-year period 22,298 petitions requested more than sixty million
                    dollars for quartermaster and commissary supplies—"stores or supplies"
                    which had been "taken or furnished … for the <hi rend="i">use</hi> of the
                    army." (Italics added.) Klingberg believes that, in view of the various restrictions and
                    extenuating circumstances, for every <hi rend="i">one</hi> who filed there were at least <hi rend="i">four</hi> with "equal qualifications for unionism and property" who
                    did not file (p. 164).</p>
            <pb n="104" id="VAA4025-052-1-114"/>
            <p>The commission spent nine years examining and evaluating these claims: those for $10,000
                    or more in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the lesser ones in the field. In this process the commissioners were assisted by some
                    special agents and commissioners, and altogether they probably examined as many as 220,000
                    witnesses. Written papers (including receipts and vouchers), oral examinations of the petitioner and
                    of witnesses, and a study of the home community were involved. Acceptable answers to eighty detailed
                    questions—many of which were multiple (appendix)—was one means of separating
                    the true loyalists from those who hopefully thought they might be able to qualify. The tests of
                    loyalty and of property were severe, but in their application the agency seems to have been
                    "careful, prudent, and just." The commission was generally immune from attack, and
                    whatever errors it might have made appear to have favored economy rather than generosity.</p>
            <p>In his analyses, and in determining the application of the procedures, the author has given detailed
                    study to the cases of the 701 men and women who filed for $10,000 or more—50
                    of them sought $100,000 or more, with one claim running to $450,000. Their
                    claims amounted to more than twenty-two and a half million dollars, or about 2 per cent of the
                    public debt of 1864. <placeName>

                    </placeName> accounted for 436 of these large claims; 125 were allowed for about
                    $950,000. Of the 16,991 claims prosecuted to a conclusion (some were disallowed as not
                    falling strictly under the provisions of the creating act), 41 per cent met the tests, and the
                    awards totalled $4,636,920.69.</p>
            <p>The history of claims under the Bowman (1883) and Tucker (1887) acts is briefly reviewed. The latter
                    act permitted the receiving of the claims of churches and schools for judicial
                    appraisal—only individuals could seek compensation from the Claims Commission. In March,
                    1915, all jurisdiction over southern claims was withdrawn from the Court of Claims.</p>
            <p>There are a few slips in construction and an occasional confusion over names, but in the main the
                    proofreading and editorial work is good. The monograph was greatly needed; it is thorough and
                    scholarly; it is a welcome addition to the all-too-small body of information on the southern
                    unionists.</p>

                    </placeName> Press, 1955, pp. xiii, 239. Illustrations, appendices, and index. $3.00.)</head>
            <p>This volume will be of interest to the historian as well as to the genealogist for through these
                    wills the social background of the frontier comes to life. The wills represent a selection from the
                    Register of Wills Office in Allegheny County, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, with <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> as the county seat; the earliest will presented was probated in 1789, the most recent
                    in 1884; the majority are from the early period. The arrangement is according to subject matter or
                    type of will. Examples of intestate proceedings are also given with itemized inventories and
                    valuation of property of persons who died without making a will. There are wills made by men of
                    affluence and some made by persons of little or no wealth, e.g., Jane Watson left her
                    "spectackles" and "staff" to her brothers, and to her daughter,
                    "a quarter of a dollar, in the hope that she will think of Heaven, and amend her ways
                    before it is too late" (pp. 42–43).</p>
            <p>The wills illustrate such topics as slavery and the indenture system (slaves were handed down along
                    with pots and pans and cows); the legal status of women (wives could not dispose of property without
                    the consent of their husbands); the currency in use; dress; Indian trade; and the tools and
                    equipment of the different professions. The largest portion of an estate went to the oldest son
                    because he was to support the mother and care for the younger children. Opportunities offered on the
                    frontier for gathering material wealth are vividly portrayed, also the risks involved. Back of the
                    cold and formal phrasing of these legal documents one glimpses the character of these pioneer men
                    and women, their hopes and their fears, their successes and their failures.</p>
            <p>The author groups the wills and weaves them together in a manner that makes the volume very readable.
                    There is a complete index and in addition there is an index of the names in the first three will

                            <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>

                    Ackermann. It included descriptions of 455 groups of papers. The present <hi rend="i">Guide</hi>
                    includes the personal papers that have been catalogued since 1935 and other items and collections
                    not included in the first one. That the second <hi rend="i">Guide</hi> is regarded as a continuation
                    of the first is evidenced in the fact that the first item is numbered 456, a continuation of the
                    numbering of the first. A total of 1,645 items is reached in this volume.</p>
            <p>As one leafs through the 173 pages of entries, he is impressed by the scope and variety of the
                    subject matter. Not only are there personal letters, diaries, reminiscences, and family papers, but
                    also business and industrial records of all sorts from domestic soap-making to large corporations,
                    records of various churches, organizations, clubs, legal papers, household accounts, and an
                    autograph collection. Here are materials out of which can be constructed a comprehensive story of <placeName>

                    </placeName> life in all its phases.</p>
            <p>The collection also includes photostats and microfilms of pertinent papers and documents from other
                    collections.</p>
            <p>Obviously much labor and care is going into assembling, arranging, and cataloguing the collections,
                    and an equal care was taken in the preparation of this <hi rend="i">Guide.</hi> The excellent name
                    and subject index (pp. 175–212) will be invaluable to researchers. It might be of value
                    to note here that Lucile Kane, one of the compilers, has prepared for the <hi rend="i">History

            <p>This book, written by an English historian, is designed to serve the British undergraduate as
                    "an introduction to the history of the American people." According to the author,
                    the various textbooks in use in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> today do not provide the British student with an adequate point of departure for
                    further study of American history. This is something which he hopes to accomplish with <hi rend="i">The Great Experiment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No effort has been made to present a strictly factual account of the development of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Rather, certain aspects or movements, mainly economic and social in nature, have been
                    selected as being of outstanding importance in the growth of American society since the time of
                    George III. Several chapters deal with "the democratic idea" and its relationship
                    to such things as "the problem of caste," "the immigrant,
                    1880–1921" and "the hegemony of big business,
                    1890–1917." Throughout the book emphasis is placed on the close relationship
                    between American and European (particularly English) history as a result of the "pull of
                    the Atlantic." After the American Revolution, on the other hand, the "pull of the
                    continent" became ever stronger, and as the westward movement continued a new
                    "mobile society" developed in America.</p>
            <p>Thistlethwaite discusses the growth of this new society, and attempts to explain to his British
                    readers just how and why it is so different from the European society which, in a sense, gave birth
                    to it. Perhaps the American concept of democracy and liberty, as actually practiced and advocated in
                    the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, may be described as "the great experiment" of which the author
                    speaks. Seeking to define this experiment, Thistlethwaite uses a sentence over 200 words in length
                    (pp. 319–320).</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">The Great Experiment</hi> is a very interesting and scholarly book, although it may
                    overshoot the audience for which it was intended. Those students who have little or no background in
                    American history perhaps will find it difficult to understand because of the many references to
                    specific events which only could be mentioned, but not explained. The material is presented in a
                    forthright, unbiased manner. It seems to this reviewer that what errors may appear are <pb n="108" id="VAA4025-052-1-118"/> mainly unavoidable sins of omission rather than sins of commission. It
                    is unfortunate that the author did not see fit to include a bibliography. While it is unlikely that
                    this book will have a large audience in this country, American readers would be interested in what
                    British students are being told about us as a nation.</p>
