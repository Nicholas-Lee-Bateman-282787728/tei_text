                    in the house of Dr. William B. Fletcher. A blessed event had just taken place, and, the paper noted,
                    "two fine girls have been placed to the credit of the Doctor on the census rolls."

                    in 1871, but this was no ordinary census. The editors evinced their concern because a recount of the <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">American cities</settlement>
                    </placeName> during the nineteenth century. Richard Wade, in his study of <geogName>Ohio River
                        Valley</geogName> towns during the early years of the century, noted that "one of the
                    most striking characteristics of this period was the development of an urban imperialism which saw
                    rising young giants seek to spread their power and influence over the entire new

                    </placeName> has commented that while that city's "voice was strident, its
                    selfesteem was by no means unique…. Indeed, civic boosterism was the logical ideology of
                    the era's urban imperialism."<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One index of a city's development was population growth. An increase in population was not
                    merely an indication of economic vitality; it also suggested to local boosters that the advantages
                    they claimed for their particular locale were becoming readily apparent to others. In antebellum <placeName>

                    districts, and, for the District of Indiana, General Benjamin Spooner was the individual entrusted
                    with this responsibility. On May 7, 1870, Spooner received thirteen boxes of census schedules (the
                    printed forms to be filled out by the enumerators as they made their rounds) from the <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Of the five, two appear to have been reasonably well qualified for their positions:
                    Louis Kern was a clerk in the post office and Richard Smock served as a deputy county clerk. It is
                    not known whether the other three enumerators—Calvin Lindley, William M. Blake, and John

                    formidable task. Four of the men were responsible for two city wards each—a substantial
                    geographic area. The size of the enumeration districts was reflected in the length of time required
                    for the count to be completed. Lindley, who was assigned the first and second wards, did not
                    complete his canvass until August 24—almost three months after the work had been
                        initiated.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>

                            ideas concerning his duty, and never counted but one twin to a family, no matter how many
                            others there might be. He only counted one John Smith in his district, rejecting the others
                            on the score that he had already got them down. Another adolescent enumerator refused to

                    during this four month interval that led to a reenumeration of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> population is unknown and probably unknowable. But some events that apparently played a
                    part in the desire for a recount can be ascertained.</p>
            <p>To begin with, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> population did experience a spurt during these four months. The sudden surge was not
                    the result of a "baby boom" or the arrival of an unusually large number of
                    in-migrants. Rather, it was accomplished by the simple procedure of annexation. The wheels for this
                    had been set in motion even before the census takers had completed their final tallies. On July 25,
                    1870, a special committee mandated "to prepare the proper papers in relation to the
                    annexation of certain contiguous territory north and east of the city" reported to the
                    mayor and the Common Council that the requisite legal notices were ready for signature and
                    subsequent publication. Following these prescribed juridical steps it was "proposed to
                    present to the Board of Commissioners of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion County</region>
                    </placeName>, a petition praying for said annexation."<hi rend="sup">19</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such a petition was duly presented to the county commissioners on September 5, 1870. It was a lengthy
                    document, "describing accurately by metes and bounds the contiguous territory desired to be
                    annexed, and setting forth the reasons for such annexation …."<hi rend="sup">20</hi> Among the reasons cited by the Common Council in support of their petition was the fact
                    that the "tracts of land sought to be annexed are in the midst of thickly populated
                    districts, or those rapidly becoming so …." Besides the advantages that would
                    accrue to the numerous new city residents, the petition noted: "The annexation of the
                    proposed territory … will give to the city an increase of revenue and wealth, enhance the
                    value of property and accelerate the progress of useful industry, enterprise and improvement. And
                    not only this; it will stimulate the growth, enlarge the business and advance the prosperity of our

                    accretion. Moreover, it was to be augmented twice more before the year was over as two additional

            <p>Annexation of contiguous territory during the fall of 1870 was only one reason why residents of the

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The first enumeration was very carelessly done. The evidence for this conclusion is
                    indirect but, cumulatively, quite convincing. As noted above, one <placeName>

                    The enumeration of the city's population during the previous summer had apparently been

                    work. There may be no cause for this," the paper admitted, "but while so much
                    depends upon their accuracy, it is not deemed out of place to call their attention to the fact that

                                enumeration and rolls 340-41 the second canvass. Indeed, this is what the National

                                however, the reverse is true—rolls 338-39 actually contain the second
                                enumeration, rolls 340-41 the first count. The National Archives indicated an intention
                                to correct their master negative (Rose K. Greenburg, acting chief, Publications Sales

                            be taken as of June 1, 1870, there is evidence to suggest that the second enumeration of <placeName>

                            </placeName> included territory that had been annexed to the city during the fall of 1870.
                            In order to examine this possibility, several individuals who lived on Malott Avenue (a
                            street that lay just outside the preannexation city limits and was absorbed in the fall of

            <p>As a result of the Common Council's appeal for their intercession, Morton and Coburn wrote a
                    lengthy letter on March 28, 1871. Although addressed to <placeName>

                    </placeName> Delano, secretary of the Interior Department, the dates on various supplementary papers
                    and endorsements strongly suggest that the letter was transmitted directly to the Census Office for
                    consideration. Morton and Coburn began their appeal by emphasizing their long association with the
                    Hoosier capital and noting that they were "well acquainted with its population [,]
                    resources and general condition." They then stated their case: "we believe that
                    the enumeration of inhabitants made by the officers authorized to take the Ninth Census in that city
                    did not include all the names of persons who were inhabitants on the first of June last, on the
                    contrary that a large number of persons were not reported by such officers and put upon the lists of
                    the Census." After summarizing the actions of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Common Council, which was "so well convinced" of the inaccuracy of
                    the census that they had commissioned a recount by "officers acting under oath with

                    </placeName> Census," Morton and Coburn went on to report the divergent figures between the
                    two enumerations for all nine wards of the city. The recount had produced a total of 48,343 persons
                    "while the report of the Census shows 41669 persons making a difference of 6674 persons not
                    counted." A final paragraph buttressed the city's claim: <quote rend="blockquote">

                    </quote> Morton and Coburn concluded by requesting that "the proper officers be directed to

            </p>
            <p>Approval of the congressmen's appeal was not automatic. Superintendent of the Census Walker
                    had little sympathy for those who registered complaints against the work of the enumerators.
                    "In the case of ninety-nine out of a hundred individual complaints of persons or families
                    omitted in the enumeration," he was able to say from the perspective of a year's
                    time, "examination of the returns will prove the census right …."<hi rend="sup">47</hi> The simple fact that a city desired reenumeration was not sufficient to
                    secure his approval. Only a few weeks before the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> appeal reached his desk, in fact, he had responded to a similar request by the city
                    council of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Wilmington</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
               </placeName>. Walker's recommendation to the secretary
                    of the Interior Department was curt: "I have reason to believe that the U.S. Census of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Wilmington</settlement>
                    </placeName> is substantially thorough and complete, and I think all the better of it for not

            <p>Fortunately, the Hoosier capital's appeal was well substantiated. Walker immediately turned
                    the list of twenty-one "B" omissions in the eighth ward over to the chief of the
                    Fourth Population Division requesting verification that the names were, indeed, missing from the

                    This apparently convinced Walker. His March 29 endorsement on the Morton-Coburn letter reads:
                    "Respectfully forwarded. It appears to me that a good case for Reenumeration is made
                        out."<hi rend="sup">50</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next step was up to the officials of the Interior Department, and they acted with dispatch. The
                    following day (March 30) W. F. Otto, the acting secretary, addressed a letter to the superintendent
                    of the census directing that a reenumeration be conducted.<hi rend="sup">51</hi> The good news
                    probably traveled quickly; that same day the chief clerk of the Census Office sent a telegram to
                    Spooner in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, presumably announcing the favorable decision.<hi rend="sup">52</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One final detail remains to be considered. The letter directing an official reenumeration was dated
                    March 30,1871. But the manuscript schedules that made their way to the Census Office—and
                    eventually to the National Archives— include those completed in February under the Common
                    Council's auspices. No enumeration was conducted following the formal authorization on
                    March 30. An examination of the last sheet of returns for each of the enumeration districts provides
                    a solution to this puzzle. Two statements are to be found immediately below the last name recorded.
                    The first is a "certification statement" and consists of a formal declaration by
                    each assistant marshal that the foregoing pages "constitute a full and true copy of the
                    census returns" for the district to which he was assigned. This statement was dated either
                    on or within a few days of the completion of the enumeration (<hi rend="i">i.e.</hi>, February,

                    eventually reduced to the 48,244 recorded in the published volumes of the ninth census.<hi rend="sup">56</hi> What remains clear, however, is that a census recount originally commissioned
                    by the city fathers in February, 1871 (apparently including some territory annexed during the fall
                    of 1870), and subsequently "verified" in April, 1871, became accepted as the

            <p>As suggested at the outset of this paper, civic chauvinism and urban rivalry were strong forces in

                    </placeName> take on more than a simple antiquarian significance when considered within this broader

                    </placeName> press when the original returns were not as large as anticipated; the bold action taken
                    by the Common Council to remedy the situation; the apparent decision to canvass areas during the
                    reenumeration that technically should have been excluded; and the strong representations made by the
                    city's delegates in Congress—all these things suggest the intensity of emotion
                    that could be generated when a city's reputation was at stake.</p>

            <p>"I have written a book which will be the most powerful single factor in bringing the South
                    back into line…," Claude G. Bowers proudly confided to fellow Democrat Jouett
                    Shouse in August, 1929.' Bowers referred to his soon to appear history of Reconstruction,

                    presidential campaign of 1928. In that election the "Solid South" wavered from its
                    traditional Democratic loyalties for the first time in a half century as seven southern states gave
                    Hoover their electoral votes. Scholars have long suspected that politics motivated Bowers in writing
                        <hi rend="i">The Tragic Era</hi>, but—as is often the case in such
                    situations—they have been unable to document their beliefs. The recently discovered
                    letter to Shouse not only confirms that Bowers intended to warn southerners about the dangers of
                    Republicanism, but it also provides a fascinating picture of the composition and promotion of this
                    important work. This letter offers striking evidence of the easy compatibility of historical
                    scholarship and political persuasion in Bowers' mind. Seldom have the political preferences
                    shaping an historiographically important work been so clearly revealed.</p>

                    Reconstruction and therefore a work of considerable influence. When the book first appeared, one
                    academic reviewer somewhat ruefully and probably correctly observed: "it is certain that
                    hundreds of American readers will get their impression of the period from these graphic
                    pages… to one who will derive it from the biographies of the professional doctors of

            <p>
               <hi rend="i">The Tragic Era</hi> presented a dramatic picture of post- Civil War American politics:
                    "Never have American public men in responsible positions, directing the destiny of the
                    Nation, been so brutal, hypocritical, and corrupt. The Constitution was treated as a doormat on
                    which politicians and army officers wiped their feet after wading in the muck."<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Bowers argued that the Radical Republicans were relieved by Lincoln's
                    death because they rejected the president's conciliatory principles and regarded him as an
                    obstacle to their plans for dealing with the South. The Radicals, led by Thaddeus Stevens, were
                    eager to punish Confederate leaders and to force the South to pay for the war. They were even more
                    concerned, Bowers asserted, about retaining national political power and hoped that by enfranchising
                    southern blacks while suppressing the white aristocracy they would be able to keep southern state
                    governments and electoral votes in Republican hands. They viciously abused Andrew Johnson, a
                    capable, reasonable, and moderate president with roots in the Democratic party, when he sought to
                    substitute mild treatment for the South.</p>

                    southern states politically and economically through blacks and carpetbaggers. A saturnalia of chaos
                    and corruption resulted. In <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName>, for example, illiterate black "peanut eaters" dominated the state
                    legislature, engaging in an orgy of drunkenness, graft, and self indulgence at the
                    taxpayer's expense. Carpetbag businessmen looted the old Confederacy through bribery and
                    guile. Bowers concluded that corruption was also the order of the day at the national level: Credit
                    Mobilier, the Whiskey Ring, Jay Gould's attempt to corner the gold market with the
                    unwitting assistance of Grant, and Secretary of War William Belknap's sale of Indian
                    reservation post traderships headed the list of exposed scandals. Increasingly authoritarian
                    measures were required to maintain the Republican hold on the South. As a rising tide of resentment
                    turned southern white voters toward the Democratic party, the Republicans stole the 1876
                    presidential election through corrupt vote counting in <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Having forged an alliance with industrialists and financiers which would keep the
                    party in power for decades to come, the Republicans could finally, said Bowers, safely relinquish
                    their faltering hold on the South.</p>
            <p>Several themes recur throughout <hi rend="i">The Tragic Era</hi>. Bowers repeatedly defended the
                    rights of states, even recently rebellious ones, to determine their own affairs without excessive
                    interference from a central government. He characterized Johnson and the postwar Democratic party as
                    defenders of Jeffersonian principles of states rights against Republican advocates of central
                    authority. Bowers also frequently condemned the political and social encouragement which blacks
                    received at Republican hands during Reconstruction. Of course the Negro was not ready for the vote,
                    claimed Bowers; only idleness, promiscuity, drunkenness, arrogant assumptions of equality, and
                    manipulation by carpetbaggers followed the political elevation of the freedman. Furthermore, Bowers
                    argued again and again, the Republicans, intent on rewarding the capitalists, continually ignored
                    the needs and difficulties of the common folk, the farmers and workers of both North and South. The
                    book presented, in sum, an unrelieved picture of Republican venality and flawed judgment in terms
                    the white South was certain to recognize.</p>
            <pb n="21" id="VAA4025-073-1-027"/>
            <p>Bowers' views of Reconstruction was not new. A series of southern novelists, among them
                    Thomas Nelson Page and Thomas Dixon, Jr., had since the 1880s propagated the "Lost
                    Cause" legend, romanticizing the antebellum South and arguing that superior force rather
                    than superior virtue caused its demise. David Wark Griffith's 1915 film, <hi rend="i">The
                        Birth of a Nation</hi>, and the 1907 novel on which it was based, Dixon's <hi rend="i">The Clansman</hi>, spread the view that Radical Republicans had badly mistreated the South
                    during Reconstruction. Of more consequence, <hi rend="i">The Tragic Era</hi> reflected the
                    interpretive viewpoint of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName> University historian William A. Dunning and his students. The "Dunning
                    School," in a series of dissertations and monographs which began to appear early in the
                    twentieth century, emphasized the harm done to the South by Radical Reconstruction and challenged
                    earlier pro-Republican histories.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> But the works of Dunning and his followers,
                    although critically well received, appealed primarily to other scholars. Bowers' colorful,
                    fast paced, and dramatic writing style, his apparently thorough research, his ability to draw vivid,
                    detailed portraits of important figures, and his skill at weaving into his story brief quotations
                    from contemporary documents produced a narrative which many found both compelling and convincing.
                        <hi rend="i">The Tragic Era</hi> became a great popular success, reached an audience
                    immeasurably larger than had the Dunning school, and was taken much more seriously than the earlier
                    fictional accounts.</p>
            <p>Reviews generally complimented <hi rend="i">The Tragic Era</hi> when it appeared. In part their
                    comments reflected the era's atmosphere of Social Darwinist intellectual racism, in part an
                    acceptance of the Dunning interpretation, and in part an appreciation of Bowers' research
                    and presentation. The greatest praise appeared, significantly, in general circulation journals.

                    years later. During his rise in the ranks of journalism and politics, Bowers kept his historical
                    interests alive. His first book, <hi rend="i">Irish Orators: A History of <placeName>
                            <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>

                        the Jackson Period</hi> called Bowers to the attention of Frank Cobb, Democratic editor of the <placeName>

            <p>While at the <hi rend="i">World</hi>, Bowers kept on with his historical research and writing during
                    lunch hours and evenings. In 1925 he published <hi rend="i">Jefferson and Hamilton</hi>. This book
                    cast Jefferson as a masterful leader of men, revolting against an entrenched elite who ignored the
                    rights of states and individuals and initiating the era of popular government. The book summarized
                    Bowers' states rights, libertarian, egalitarian political philosophy. Written in a powerful
                    dramatic style, <hi rend="i">Jefferson and Hamilton</hi> became a best seller and earned its author
                    both scholarly and partisan praise.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>

            <p>Democrats, still divided by the rural-urban, conservative- progressive intraparty struggles of 1924,
                    could all find something attractive in Bowers' Jefferson. As a result, Bowers found himself
                    repeatedly called upon to address party gatherings to generate harmony and stir enthusiasm. With his
                    background in oratory as well as history, he proved very adept at the task. In January, 1928, when
                    the Democrats' Jackson Day banquet in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> threatened to become a verbal battle among various presidential contenders, Bowers was
                    asked to give the principal address. Using the Jefferson and Jackson eras as historical examples, he
                    attacked party factionalism and pointed to past glories of a united Democratic party. The speech was
                    so enthusiastically received that Bowers was soon chosen as the keynote speaker for the 1928

            <p>Not only was it unusual for a convention keynote speech to be given by a nonofficeholder, but also it
                    was rare for such a speech to attract much attention. Bowers, however, with an eloquent delivery and
                    a message sprinkled with historical references, made a memorable address. He drew a clear

                                        congressman (Free Soil party, 1849-1851; Republican, 1861-1871), and a leading
                                        Radical who served as a member of the Committee on the Conduct of the War and as
                                        one of seven House managers for the impeachment trial of Andrew Johnson. He came
                                        to oppose the Republican leadership during the first Grant administration,
                                        presided at the 1872 Liberal Republican convention, and by 1876 had joined the

            <p>As Bowers had hoped, <hi rend="i">The Tragic Era</hi> was appreciated by Democrats. One measure of

                    the best person to nominate FDR at the convention. Roosevelt extended the invitation to Bowers

                    Hearst, a conservative, isolationist Democrat who backed John Nance Garner for the nomination,
                    indicated his opposition, probably recalling Bowers' ability to stir a convention audience.
                    A bitterly disappointed Bowers declined FDR's offer.<hi rend="sup">32</hi>

                    duties of the embassy assured that Bowers had not "written my last line in an attempt to
                    serve… [the Democratic party]." Two more laudatory volumes on Jefferson were
                    written during Bowers' foreign assignments.<hi rend="sup">33</hi> Although many considered

                    after the 1928 defection and remained an essential factor in party presidential victories from 1932
                    through 1964. There is no way of knowing whether <hi rend="i">The Tragic Era</hi> directly
                    influenced votes, but its arguments were woven into the rhetoric and rationale of southern
                    Democracy. The book, however, failed the test of time for good history. Subsequent scholarship has
                    demonstrated many serious inadequacies in its conclusions.</p>
            <p>Both its political and historical dimensions must finally be taken into account in assessing <hi rend="i">The Tragic Era</hi>. The book was, after all, not out of step with the scholarly
                    accounts of the time which dealt with Reconstruction. Furthermore, it brought to light significant
                    material, the Julian diary in particular, which tended to reinforce such interpretations. The
                    book's greatest departure from the Dunning school was its lively, dramatic style which
                    together with its successful marketing produced its great impact. At the same time <hi rend="i">The
                        Tragic Era</hi> stands revealed as a book with a clear partisan intent, one which brought
                    appropriate political rewards to its author. Bowers, as he examined primary and secondary material
                    on Reconstruction and then wrote his account, constantly chose to cast Republican behavior in the
                    worst possible light. Scholars certainly cannot block others from writing
                    "history," but they should consider the implications of leaving the writing of
                    exciting, readable, popular accounts to those with special interests to plead or of allowing biased
                    interpretations to stand unchallenged once they appear. In the hands of as talented an author as
                    Claude G. Bowers, such opportunities can register a deep and seriously distorted impression of the
                    past on the public mind.</p>

            <p>In the golden age of the railroad builders during the last half of the nineteenth century, what
                    happened to a village when the railroad passed it by? Exactly that predicament faced Locke Town,
                    Indiana, in 1872–1873.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> The only village in Locke Township, <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Locke had been platted about 1867. In six years it had grown to nearly two hundred
                    people. According to one source there were "three dry goods stores, one drug store, one
                    grocery store, one hardware store, one tin shop, one furniture store, two shoe shops, two sawmills,
                    one shingle-mill, one wagon-making shop, one steam grist and flouring mill, three blacksmith shops,
                    about forty dwellings, one hotel, one public school-house, one church (United Brethren), three
                        physicians."<hi rend="sup">2</hi> It was a pleasant, prosperous village with no place

            </p>
            <p>There was an air of expectancy and uneasiness about Locke. Businessmen—for the most part
                    young and energetic —recognized that access to the B&amp;O was necessary if the town
                    were to remain a viable entity. The merchants had goods to bring in; the producers had products to
                    ship out. Their solution was to build a station—Locke Station, as it were—at
                    the railroad's nearest access point. From Locke it was one half mile east to the
                    Locke-Union Township road which led, chuck- hole by chuckhole, two miles south to an intersecting
                    east-west road, which was less than two blocks from the railroad right of way. Existing roads, such
                    as they were, thus brought the town within several hundred feet of the action. At that point the
                    Locke businessmen would build their station and set up a hack or carryall to transfer passengers and
                    freight to their town.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Agreement was quickly reached with the B&amp;O. Locke would donate five acres on which the
                    railroad could construct necessary buildings, and the town would grade the side tracks without
                    charge. In return the railroad contracted to build a side track station and passenger house to be
                    called Locke Station.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> Problems soon developed, however. The town could not
                    fulfill all its part of the bargain. The five acres were not to be had. The owners, Daniel Metzler
                    and John Culp, Jr., through whose farms the railroad ran, did not make the land
                    available—not at least for the purpose Locke had in mind. Under circumstances that remain
                    cloudy and mysterious, Locke (rather than the railroad) did put up a <hi rend="i">private</hi>
                    passenger house or depot on railroad property or right of way. The new depot became Locke (Station)
                    on the B&amp;O time cards.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> At five o'clock on December 6, 1874,
                    the new station's schedule went into effect. One train from each direction stopped daily,
                    and passengers and freight were transferred by hack to Locke.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>

            <p>Although on the surface it seemed that things had not worked out so badly after all, any euphoria was
                    short lived. If trouble had not been suspected or known earlier, it was by the middle of December,
                    1874: Metzler and Culp, joined by Henry Stahly who owned land north of them, had platted and
                    surveyed their own village, Nappanee, around Locke's station.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> Worse
                    still, Metzler and Culp had donated two and three acres respectively to the railroad for one dollar
                    each for "the location of a station."<hi rend="sup">10</hi> As matters stood by
                    1875, then, Locke had its depot—now almost surrounded by a new village
                    plat—its own man in charge of the depot, its Locke Station on the B&amp;O time cards,
                    its daily hack service, and a passel of big problems. The rest of the story concerns
                    Locke's attempts to remain a viable village and Nappanee's endeavors to become
                    one.</p>

                    citizens of Locke or Nappanee. Nappanee residents claimed in the pages of the newspapers that from
                    the beginning certain parties in Locke "played the wolf in sheeps clothing":
                    "in the guise of friendship for the new village they [Locke residents] had misrepresented
                    the town" and "had done their very best to put every obstacle in the way of the
                    Nappaneese." Nappanee partisans also occasionally enumerated persons in Locke who had been
                    "friends from the start."<hi rend="sup">11</hi> Whether there was substance to any
                    of these claims is not known since specific evidence was not cited. There is a possibility that some
                    Locke parties, in their zeal to keep their own village alive, planned to purchase lots in Nappanee
                    but never to build on them. Such action would, of course, have been disruptive and delayed
                    development in the new town. But this is supposition based upon general claims plus certain
                    "conditions" attached to a number of early lot sales in Nappanee: "Five

                    Nappanee that Locke citizens, by word of mouth and by letters purporting to come from Nappanee, had
                    spread "false and malicious information" about the new town. Again, however, the
                    specifics were not outlined. Locke partisans probably made similar statements about their neighbors
                    in Nappanee, but their correspondence with the newspapers is considerably less in quantity so fewer
                    such claims have been found.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the competition between the two towns Locke had got off to a fast start. In the early newspaper
                    debates Locke's correspondent, OCCASIONAL, naturally stressed the town's depot,
                    owned and operated by the Eby brothers of Locke with Henry Eby as station agent; its daily hack;
                    and, most important of all, its station. He also pointed out that business was
                    "flourishing" in the town, and he tossed in a tongue in cheek query. Where was
                    that magnificent place called Nappanee anyway? He had checked his atlas but could find no such town
                    in it. He closed, though, by saying he "hoped to get a situation there."<hi rend="sup">14</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Meanwhile, Nappanee had also taken to the newspapers. On December 17, 1874, less than a week after

            <p>The exact nature of the "inducements" which Nappanee was purportedly offering to
                    businessmen was not explained in the newspapers, but with Nappanee offering such incentives could
                    Locke do less? One prominent Locke businessman offered "up to $250" to
                    a "bending factory" to locate in his town rather than in Nappanee. His attempt at
                    persuasion, however, was unsuccessful since shipping facilities were obviously superior in
                        Nappanee.<hi rend="sup">17</hi> Residents of Locke also planned improvements within the town.
                    The streets were to be widened and were to be lighted by a system of gas lamps, presumably one at
                    each corner. Since the plan never got beyond installing a single gas lamp, it became a running joke
                    with NAPPANEE at the expense of OCCASIONAL and Locke: "the latest move … [is] to
                    embellish the classical shades of Locke with street lamps, the gentleman who originated the idea
                    munificently heading the subscription with $1.00. Truly such generous conduct ought to be
                    remembered, and coming generations may well exclaim as they gaze with awe on such improvements,

                            <pb n="41" id="VAA4025-073-1-047"/> Nappanee is going to eclipse Locke, in spite of our
                            utmost endeavors to prevent it. But still we must appear as if business is brisk here, for a
                            little while longer.</p>
                        <p>The truth is, we own property here, that since the coming of Nappanee has been rapidly
                            depreciating in value and if things go on the way they have been going, after a while we
                            could make more by letting it out for a potato patch. But you see, Mr. Editor, if we can
                            only induce a ew people to believe that Nappanee is a part of Locke, as we have been trying,
                            and succeed in roping in a few greenhorns to buy our real estate here, we can then move over
                            to Nappanee and find a situation there….</p>
                        <p>We have tried every expedient that we could hit upon for puffing Locke, in fact we played the
                            "wolf in sheeps clothing," and have written from Nappanee, damaging it as
                            much as we could. Of course we did not strictly confine ourselves to the truth; but then it
                            was in a good cause. We have now a plan we think will do. It is to widen the streets here,
                            and put lamps on the corners. We are doing nicely at present and if
                            "Nappanee" will only keep his mouth shut, we think our plan will
                            succeed….</p>
                        <p>We have only one lamp at present, and we have ten times as much gas as it can consume, but
                            even then, between you and me, we think we can work better in the dark, at all events, until
                            our property is sold—and Locke looks better by night.<hi rend="sup">24</hi>

            <p>But was this genuine correspondence from Locke, or was it fabricated in Nappanee and planted in the
                    press? While it has some ring of authenticity, it is suspect. The general tone and style are
                    reminiscent of NAPPANEE. It is also the only correspondence signed LOCKETOWN. Moreover, the next
                    correspondence again conies from TRUMP, JR., who makes a point which may have more significance than
                    appears on the surface: "today, <hi rend="i">were it not for the energy of the Eby Bros,
                        the trains would go smoking thru your place as thru any other wilderness</hi>. We do not propose
                    donating anything in charity to Nappanee; nor will we permit her to pilfer from us. Send in your
                        penny."<hi rend="sup">25</hi> Did Locke's aborted "donation"
                    of those five acres to the railroad perhaps trigger Metzler's and Culp's notions
                    to plat a village, or had they come to that decision earlier, independently? The true story will
                    probably never be known; yet, TRUMP, JR., raises a question upon which it might be profitable to
                    speculate.</p>

                    good article, but he should not try to disturb the ‘old landmarks’ of Locke,
                    for they have the oldest title in law and will hold the ‘balance of power.’

                    wrestling match. Who will win, is the question. They are too near together. Our mother told us long

            </p>
            <p>Still later NAPPANEE returned to the matter of the lamps and the penny: "That penny I laid
                    in readiness at my bankers, made out to your order, and the only trouble now is how to send it, as
                    you say that there are so many carpet baggers around Locke, I would be afraid to make my appearance
                    there with so large amount of specie on my person. What has become of that other lamp? Did it
                    explode already?" Worse for Locke than the sarcasm was a note that prefaced the foregoing:
                    "There is some rumor, with what foundations we cannot say, that Henry F. Eby has received
                    orders from the railroad company to remove his depot, so that the company can commence building
                    their own station." As if that were not enough, NAPPANEE added that the postmaster at
                    Nappanee had received his credentials and that the new postoffice — called Nappanee
                    — had been established. Joe Strohm, he further reported, was moving his planing mill from
                    Locke to Nappanee, and he charged: "Some malicious individual belonging to Locke inserted a
                    pin with the point upward in the cushion of a buggy seat, belonging to a gentleman who went to Locke
                    from this place the other day…. such deplicable [sic] tricks are a disgrace to any
                    civilized community."<hi rend="sup">28</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Meanwhile, if NAPPANEE's account can be believed (and his is the only report of the event),
                    one Locke partisan personally carried the battle right to the streets of Nappanee. Supposedly he
                    made the point that as a more advanced town Locke had certain advantages over an upstart, but his
                    choice of words was poor, again assuming that NAPPANEE reported the story faithfully. <list type="footnotes">

                    or business houses with them. And the announcements of new buildings and businesses continued at a

                    affair, however, occurred in May, 1875. Presumably the new postmaster at Nappanee, as one of his
                    first duties, had on May 10 written the B&amp;O suggesting that since a postoffice had been
                    established at Nappanee, the time was ripe to change the railroad station's name from Locke
                    to Nappanee. The alleged reply was dated May 15. NAPPANEE quoted it as follows: <text>

            <p>There is an abundance of questions about this affair. Was such a letter actually received in Nappanee
                    or was it concocted in Nappanee? On the other hand, if it was fabricated in Locke, as NAPPANEE
                    implied, how did the Locke correspondent so quickly intercept a postmaster's letter to the
                    B&amp;O? Or a final question, was the letter a genuine communication from the B&amp;O?</p>
            <p>With this rhubarb NAPPANEE, too, ceased as a correspondent. All the original protagonists were thus
                    removed from the scene: OCCASIONAL, TRUMP, JR., LOCKE-TOWN, and the hardiest of them all, NAPPANEE.
                    With respect to the Locke-Nappanee tussle, no further correspondent of note arose in Locke. In
                    Nappanee, however, two new writers appeared, KITTY and MINNIE. While each reported genuine and
                    meaningful information, they also needled one another! But that is part of another story.</p>
            <p>By August, 1875, KITTY was reporting momentous progress in Nappanee. The citizens had agreed to build
                    a passenger depot and to donate one thousand dollars to the railroad. In return the B&amp;O
                    agreed to build a grain elevator, freight depot, lumber dock, and stockyards. In fact, the president
                    of the B&amp;O was reported to have been in Nappanee to locate them. In addition to this news,
                    KITTY could not resist taking some potshots at Locke: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Messrs. Eby Bros., of Locke, have been given notice to remove their building that now answers
                            the purposes of a depot, within 60 days, and when that is gone we suppose the claims of
                            Locke of having been the benefactor of Nappanee, perishes….</p>
                        <p>What has become of all the Locke correspondents, who were so busy last winter? We should like
                            to hear how they are getting on over there. We know that they try to persuade themselves and
                            others that they do as much business as formerly, but the fact that in one store where four
                            men used to be kept busy attending to the wants of customers, one man can now easily attend

               <hi rend="i">The American Revolution in the West</hi>. By George M. Waller. (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>: Nelson-Hall, 1976. Pp. xxi, 153. Illustrations, notes, maps, suggestions for
                    additional reading, index. $10.00.)</head>
            <p>George M. Waller eschews "academic profundities" (p. xiii) in this volume on
                    military campaigns in the West during the time of the American Revolution. While all theaters are
                    dutifully covered, George Rogers Clark's exploits provide a narrative focus.
                    Waller's portrait of Clark is generally an admiring one notwithstanding Clark's
                    "personal reasons" for pressing <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>'s cause. "Fortunately his personal ambitions coincided with the
                    public interest" (pp. 49–50). Waller's story climaxes with the
                    successful campaigns against Kas-kaskia and Vincennes. The march on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> and capture of the "hair buyer," British Colonel Henry Hamilton, was
                    "a minor epic of heroic and determined men" (p. 69). Indeed, Clark may have
                    aborted a decisive British campaign against the frontiers.</p>
            <p>If Clark's heroics give this volume a dramatic unity, they also limit its scope. The
                    American Revolution does not fit neatly into western history; conversely, the significance of these
                    episodes in Revolutionary history is not clear. It is doubtful that Clark's conquests were
                    important in treaty negotiations at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Further, British-American conflict in the Northwest continued long after the war was
                    supposed to be over. The time frame appears inappropriate too if frontier hostilities are seen in
                    the broader context of white-Indian conflict. Waller is aware of these problems. Within the limits
                    of his conception of the war in the West he succeeds admirably in reducing dozens of minor episodes
                    into some kind of order. But this conception is too narrow to be of much use or interest to the
                    serious historian; lay readers may be left with dangerous misapprehensions.</p>
            <p>Waller asserts that "the ever-increasing number of Americans" moving West was
                    "the most significant factor in determining the outcome of the war" (p. 96). But
                    the shifting fortunes of war illuminated political and sectional tensions within the new
                    settlements. It is clear that many frontiersmen were indifferent to the American cause; Loyalism was
                    a major problem. Indeed, the political loyalties of westerners remained suspect long after the war,
                    and, as <pb n="55" id="VAA4025-073-1-061"/> Waller points out, the westward thrust of settlement
                    scattered population, creating a "new kind of weakness." The links between
                    ultimate military success and political and social developments in the West thus appear to be more
                    complicated than Waller allows.</p>
            <p>Perhaps such "profundities" are out of place in a bicentennial history. Perhaps the
                    only way to write a book about American "heroes" is to focus on military
                    operations, no matter how trivial and no matter how complicated and compromised the motives of the
                    protagonists. Yet if Americans celebrate "heroic" soldiers following
                    "their leaders on seemingly hopeless missions, enduring privation and danger" (p.
                    31), must their Indian enemies always "lurk about" committing acts of unimaginable
                    savagery on defenseless women and children? Must Indian soldiers be described as "unstable,
                    vacillating, and unreliable" (p. 31) ? Waller admits that "Indian-hating"
                    whites committed some atrocities, but who <hi rend="i">would not hate the Indians of</hi>
                    Waller's book ? <hi rend="i">Surely</hi> a proper bicentennial history can celebrate the
                    heroism and recognize the humanity of all American peoples.</p>

            <p>This slim, attractive volume tells the story of Fort Laurens, the little outpost on the
                        <geogName>Tuscarawas River</geogName> that marked the westernmost advance of American
                    continentalss into the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> country during the Revolutionary War. The fort was established by General Lachlan
                    McIntosh, the second of four soldiers who commanded at Fort Pitt under General George <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the Continental Congress. Constructed in November, 1778, Fort Laurens was designed
                    to support the line of attack against the British western headquarters at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Mclntosh had established a fort named for himself on the north bank of the
                        <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> at the mouth of <geogName>Beaver River</geogName>. Fort Laurens
                    represented a further extension westward some seventy miles.</p>
            <pb n="56" id="VAA4025-073-1-062"/>
            <p>The authors recount from first hand sources the arduous advance of McIntosh's forces,
                    numbering about twelve hundred, burdened with supplies and slowed by weakening pack horses. Pressure
                    from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, whose leaders favored George Rogers Clark's stroke against British outposts
                    on the <geogName>Mississippi and Wabash rivers</geogName>, led Congress to scale down its plans.
                    McIntosh was ordered to attack Indians along the <geogName>Sandusky River</geogName> rather than to
                    attempt an attack on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Worsening weather, dwindling food supplies, and expiring enlistments halted the
                    enterprise at the Tuscarawas. McIntosh decided to retire to Fort Mclntosh and Fort Pitt as soon as
                    Fort Laurens was completed. By early December, 1778, the little army withdrew, leaving one hundred
                    fifty men under Colonel John Gibson to complete construction and man the outpost. Indians besieged
                    the fort most of the winter. The garrison suffered and starved until Mclntosh led a relief
                    expedition in the spring to replace Gibson's stubborn defenders with Major Frederick <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vernon</settlement>
                    </placeName> and fresh troops.</p>
            <p>Colonel Daniel Brodhead, successor to Mclntosh, urged abandonment of Fort Laurens. Arguing against
                    the strategic concepts of his predecessor, Brodhead opposed spreading his slender forces among many
                    small forts. Under orders from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Brodhead maintained Fort Laurens for six months. It was finally abandoned in August,
                    1779. In an interesting final chapter the authors discuss the archaeological findings of Richard
                    Michael Gramly and his associates, who have excavated the site of the fort, and the successful
                    efforts directed by the <placeName>

            <p>The book justifiably dispenses with footnotes since it is based almost entirely on a limited number
                    of sources fully acknowledged in a concluding note. The lack of an index may hamper use of the book
                    for reference.</p>
            <p>Brief references to other events—such as Dunmore's War, Clark's
                    campaigns, Chief Cornstalk's murder, or the relationships between leaders at Fort Pitt and
                    the eastern <placeName>

                    </placeName> Indians and their Moravian missionary leaders—are likely to arouse interest
                    in events with which this account does not deal. If so, one hopes this lively little volume will
                    stimulate further reading on wider aspects of the valiant, frustrating, but finally successful
                    struggle that held the western borderlands for the new nation.</p>

            <p>This volume maintains the scholarly standards of its three predecessors and perhaps presents a more
                    cohesive intellectual design and texture than the others. One finishes the book with a sense that
                    the Revolution's impact abroad was considerable, though not always in the places, at the
                    times, or upon the persons one might most readily suspect. Quite commonly, as Robert R. Palmer
                    points out in his restrained and judicious opening essay, "it was the action of the
                    Americans, not their ideas, that was influential" (p. 13).</p>
            <p>Claude Fohlen's "The Impact of the American Revolution on <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>" tends to be very critical of previous interpretations, overly cautious,
                    sometimes agnostic ("it is better at this point to admit our ignorance," p. 28),
                    and occasionally just plain banal ("The American Revolution was more or less present in the
                    background of the Constituent Assembly," p. 35). He also, unfortunately, seems to be
                    unaware of Joyce Appleby's very pertinent article in the <hi rend="i">William and Mary
                        Quarterly</hi> (April, 1971).</p>
            <p>In essays covering the impact of the Revolution on the Dutch Republic, the Spanish and Portuguese
                    speaking world, and <placeName>
                        <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>
                    </placeName>, J. W. Schulte Nordholt, Mario Rodriguez, and Owen Dudley Edwards all offer much more
                    vigorous, substantial, well documented, subtle, and charming discussions. Edwards' article,
                    in fact, is brilliantly written and is frequently fresh in its conclusions, although it is also
                    outrageous or hyperbolic at times. (Even his footnotes are both puckish and provocative.) Edwards
                    reinforces Palmer's point with this well founded assertion: "It quickly emerged
                    that the American revolution, if it contributed little in ideology to <placeName>
                        <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>
                    </placeName>, gave a new sense of priorities to Irish Protestants. Once they were armed they could
                    see the logic of more economic power for themselves as preferential to the absolute subordination of
                    the Catholics" (p. 141).</p>
            <p>Edwards' treatment seems in some respects to contradict John H. Plumb's passing
                    remarks upon <placeName>
                        <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>
                    </placeName> in his essay concerning the Revolution's impact upon Great Britain. Otherwise,
                    Plumb's piece is very personalized and readable, though <pb n="58" id="VAA4025-073-1-064"/>
                    it suffers from the strange neglect of relevant monographs by Arthur Sheps, Dora Mae Clark, and
                    Solomon Lutnick. Nikolai N. Bolkhovitinov, a senior academician from the Union of Soviet Socialist
                    Republics, performs very predictably in "The American Revolution and the Russian
                    Empire." Proper incantations about Karl Marx ana the capitalist system pop up in the first
                    two paragraphs. The author then settles down to some good descriptive writing but loses all sense of
                    proportion on pages 89–90 with a series of wildly overstated claims about the cosmic
                    importance of Aleksandr N. Radischev.</p>
            <p>The book concludes with three very brief commentaries about the Revolution's impact upon

                    its utility. It does offer rich documentation, however, which many will mine to good effect in the
                    future. It is, most certainly, an interesting volume with some stimulating lessons for the <placeName>

            <p>This is, despite its merits, a flawed volume. As the author correctly points out in his preface,
                    there are at least three major limitations to the work. The study is extremely narrow in scope; it
                    is based upon a flimsy research foundation; and there are serious methodological problems in
                    determining precisely who the French intendants of the army were in the seventeenth century. These
                    are, however, not the only limitations to Baxter's book. It is written in a disjointed and
                    often opaque manner. As a result it is often difficult for the reader to come to grips with the
                    essential thrust of the author's argument. Moreover, the fragmentary <pb n="59" id="VAA4025-073-1-065"/> nature of the evidence presented creates serious problems regarding
                    both continuity and analysis.</p>
            <p>Baxter traces the evolution of the office of the French army intendant during the period from 1630 to
                    1670. The army intendant's major responsibility shifted gradually from the administration
                    of justice to a far more complex role. He became responsible for the army's finances; he
                    took care of its sick and wounded and also paid the troops. In addition, he supervised work on
                    fortifications and reported to his superior, the secretary of state for war, everything that
                    occurred in his locality. It is clear that the army intendant's real power rested not only
                    on his own administrative ability but also on the kind of support he received from his king. Not
                    surprisingly the king utilized army intendants to try to impose civilian control upon the regions of <placeName>

            <p>Within two decades of his arrival in North America Sir William Johnson had become a legend. As a
                    farmer, merchant, soldier, and diplomat, and as a Mohawk sachem, colonial official, and English
                    baronet, Johnson's decisions and activities affected the lives of many Americans, both red
                    and white, during the volatile years of the second half of the eighteenth century. As a result,
                    previous accounts of Johnson's life have often been mired in myth, half truth, and
                    misstatement. In this first of a projected two volume biography, Milton W. Hamilton seeks to rescue
                    Johnson, who "has suffered so much unjust representation over the passage of
                    time…" (p. ix). As former editor of the Johnson Papers and retired state
                    historian of <placeName>

                    to accomplish his task. Perhaps he has succeeded too well.</p>

                    </placeName> concludes this first volume at 1763 with the construction of "Johnson
                    Hall," the material capstone of Johnson's rise to preeminence in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> and the colonies generally. During the course of the book he details Johnson's
                    accumulation of personal and public influence by concentrating on his activities as frontier
                    entrepreneur, Indian diplomat, and military leader. The amount of detail and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s grasp of it is prodigious. In fact, for almost one third of the text readers
                    follow Johnson to the successful conclusion of the 1755 Canadian campaign which resulted in a defeat
                    for the French, the capture of Baron de Dieskau, and atonement for Edward Braddock's
                    debacle (pp. 113–200).</p>
            <p>For all its precision, however, the book has faults. The emphasis on the particular has precluded
                    real analysis. Johnson does not come to life. For example, in the spring of 1738 Johnson arrived in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> knowing little "of frontier conditions or needs…" (p. 8).
                    In the space of eight years and fourteen pages, "while trade declined, and with it the
                    interest of the English colony [<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>] among the natives [Iroquois]…," Johnson made himself "a
                    man of affairs, and his trade with the Indians had won him their friendship" (p. 22). But <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> does not explain precisely how this immigrant become entrepreneur succeeded where
                    others failed. It is necessary to know more than that he "perhaps… at first fell
                    in with the traders' ways," that "he was far-sighted," that he
                    "consulted the Indian chiefs," and that he "watched for his
                    opportunities…" (p. 22). Did this make Johnson unique, or was it a process often
                    repeated on this and other frontiers? That the data for such analysis exist <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> demonstrates through an over abundant use of direct quotations from contemporary

                    </placeName>'s characterization of the American Indian is also open to question. The native

                    his corruption and degeneracy, was an ingenious child" (p. 45). Given the significance of
                    the Iroquois Confederacy to Johnson's success the reader might expect <placeName>

                    </placeName> Democratic vote. Descendant of two presidents who were defeated after single terms,
                    Adams took an unpopular stand which he thought consistent with the meaning of his name. An Adams, he
                    told a reporter in 1975, should "always be on the side of the rebels" (p. 369).</p>
            <p>Adams' view is one permissible way of interpreting a tradition that includes John and John
                    Quincy Adams, the "Novanglus" papers, and unbending opposition to the gag rule.
                    Others who bear that tradition may view it differently; George Caspar Homans, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> sociologist, Republican, and "hard-boiled egghead," is no rebel in
                    any obvious sense; and fellow Adamses have been business executives, yachtsmen, and gentlemen
                    farmers more often than leaders of revolt (p. 369). Their tradition, begun by a rebel who was also a
                    founder of American conservatism, is consistently distinguished but not uniformly rebellious.</p>
            <p>Francis Russell's deeply respectful history of the Adams family briefly recognizes its
                    living members but properly concentrates on the generations from President John Adams through great
                    grandson Brooks, last of the line to occupy the "Old House" at <placeName>

                    disappointment, and recurrent pessimism about the course of democratic culture. Whether they
                    rebelled against empire or slave power, learned to make and keep money in Jay Gould's
                    unseemly era, or sought refuge in the Virgin, the Adamses were usually out <pb n="62" id="VAA4025-073-1-068"/> of harmony with their times. In 1919 Brooks Adams thought that the
                    world had grown tired of his family; the idea was more characteristic than original.</p>
            <p>The Adams family history is familiar to literate Americans, and Russell tells it in familiar terms.
                    He has digested the standard books and documents, which are listed in his short bibliography, and
                    has made a coherent, highly entertaining narrative which will neither excite nor offend scholars.
                    Some might object to his insistent support of the Adamses against all
                    opponents—"devious" Martin <placeName>

                    partisanship is entirely aboveboard and is not usually heavy handed.</p>

            <p>Like other volumes in the <hi rend="i">Library of American Biography</hi> series, <hi rend="i">Andrew
                        Jackson and the Search for Vindication</hi> is a concise, interpretive biography intended for a
                    general college audience. Based primarily on published sources, the book retells the familiar saga
                    of Old Hickory. James C. Curtis clearly recounts Jackson's turbulent youth, rise to power
                    and prominence in frontier <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName>, military exploits, entry into presidential politics, and eventful two term presidency.
                    Because the events of Jackson's life have been described many times, this brief volume adds
                    no new details to the story.</p>
            <p>What Curtis has done is to interpret Old Hickory's life and career in a fresh manner. Using
                    an incisive, no nonsense, psychological analysis, Curtis argues that Jackson's life
                    represented a continual search for personal vindication. Beneath Old Hickory's aggressive
                    and bold behavior lay "deep uncertainties" <pb n="63" id="VAA4025-073-1-069"/>
                    rooted in his childhood. "Throughout his life he felt a need to prove himself, to triumph
                    over enemies he believed were assaulting his reputation. Even in victory, he never felt victorious.
                    The more his reputation grew, the more he feared that some conspiracy, some cabal was working to
                    diminish his standing with the people" (p. ix). Curtis believes that this anxiety resulted
                    in an obsessive quest for "control" and "order" in
                    Jackson's personal life and public career. Hence, Jackson's military career and
                    campaign for president as well as his conduct in the Peggy Eaton affair, the bank war, Indian
                    affairs, and nullification are viewed respectively as part of this intense personal search. In each
                    case Curtis argues that Jackson was moved primarily by personal anxieties, not political or national
                    objectives.</p>
            <p>The author's approach inevitably results in an unflattering portrait of Jackson as a
                    military chieftain and public servant. Always preoccupied by selfish personal considerations,
                    Jackson is never depicted as a leader who acted because he believed that what he did was in the best
                    interests of his party or the American people. "Founder of the national party system,
                    champion of the common man, and creator of the strong presidency are but a few of the accolades
                    history and historians accord him. Jackson did not set out to serve these ends. His goals were more
                    limited" (p. 184). Curtis is even critical of Jackson's handling of the
                    nullification crisis. Although long accorded high marks by scholars for his conduct during the
                    controversy, Jackson is criticized here because he followed "no consistent political
                    course" during the crisis and failed "to give much thought to partisan
                    consequences of his actions" (p. 133). Curtis is forced necessarily to ignore a wealth of
                    interpretations dealing with Jackson's role in the bank war, nullification, Indian removal,
                    the creation of the Democratic party, and the growth of the presidency. As a result this intriguing
                    biography is not likely to have much impact on existing historiography.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Andrew Jackson and the Search for Vindication</hi> is a well written and fascinating
                    study. Because it is written for a general audience, the book carries no footnotes and includes only
                    a perfunctory note on sources. Nor has Curtis cluttered his narrative with psychological jargon. In
                    short, this modest but suggestive volume should be of interest to college students as well as
                    historians of the period.</p>

            <p>This collection of studies, one for each of nine northern states, is an important contribution to an
                    understanding of state and local history in Reconstruction politics, a subject relatively neglected
                    in the past but currently attracting considerable attention. The volume brings together the
                    expertise of nine scholars, each of whom has an intimate knowledge of the state about which he
                    writes. With the exception of David <placeName>

                    contributes an historiographie essay and an introduction that brings some cohesion to the separate
                    state studies.</p>
            <p>A collection devoted to a single topic raises expectations of internal coherence and broad
                    conclusions that are difficult to satisfy, especially with nine distinctive political entities under
                    consideration. A final chapter of conclusions, even if tentative ones, squarely based upon the nine
                    studies would have been helpful. Each contributor has shed some light upon reform at the state
                    level, but it is disappointing that the editor makes no explicit evaluation of the hypothesis raised
                    by his earlier work, namely that in the immediate postwar years Republicans tried to transform their
                    party into a vehicle for progressive social reform, an effort shattered in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> by hostile public reaction to black suffrage. The separate studies confirm the fact
                    that advocacy of equal suffrage where it had not existed before the war was politically dangerous
                    though not necessarily devastating. They do not, however, establish an unequivocal relationship
                    between Republicans and socioeconomic reform. Only <placeName>

                    <pb n="65" id="VAA4025-073-1-071"/> leaders seem to have turned deliberately to reform as a means of
                    retaining power in anticipation of the disappearance of wartime issues. Yet in most of the other
                    eight states Republicans in positions of power were responsive to reform impulses and were generally
                    ready to accept an expansive role for state government. Why institutional reform (other than black
                    suffrage) at the state level did not become an effective partisan issue remains obscure. Limited
                    perceptions in the face of socioeconomic change and a diversity of interests and values within the
                    Republican constituency appear to have played a larger role than any subservience to vested economic
                    interests.</p>
            <p>Ironically, the state focus of these studies underscores the importance of the national scene for
                    even the local politics of the postwar decade. Except in respect to Reconstruction and the Negro,
                    issues did not define party lines but cut across them. As congressional Republicans advanced from
                    equality before the law to equality at the ballot box, the national issue concerning black suffrage
                    became dangerous and divisive, but no alternative promised to unite the party and advance its
                    fortunes. Loyalty forged in civil conflict remained strong, but state Republican leaders
                    increasingly turned from advocacy to patronage machines and the politics of accommodation.</p>

            <p>It is generally believed by historians and laymen alike that black voters in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>—where they were permitted to vote—were overwhelmingly Republican
                    from the 1860s until the 1930s, after which period they have been over-whelmingly Democratic.
                    According to the common view, there were a couple of instances in which this was not true, such as
                    the presidential election of 1912 when many Negroes, including W. E. B. Du Bois, crossed over and
                    temporarily supported Woodrow Wilson; but it was not until the New Deal era that the vast majority
                    of black voters left the party of <pb n="66" id="VAA4025-073-1-072"/> Abraham <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> and joined the party of Franklin D. Roosevelt. It has also been freely acknowledged
                    that the Republican hold on the black electorate was not so much a result of a beneficent racial
                    policy or an organized effort to recruit Negroes as it was a consequence of the fact that black
                    voters simply had no where else to go.</p>
            <p>In this interesting analysis of northern Democratic party politics, Lawrence Grossman questions the
                    traditional view. Beginning with the Ulysses S. Grant-Horatio Seymour contest of 1868 and concluding
                    with the Grover <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName>-Benjamin Harrison contest of 1892, Grossman traces the evolving posture of the
                    Democratic party toward black Americans. He concludes that northern Democrats, contrary to the
                    popular image, did in fact make a qualified but sincere effort to win black support. The
                    "new departure" in Democratic policy, i.e., accepting the principle of
                    congressional reconstruction in the South while undermining its enforcement, enabled the national
                    party to make liberal overtures to potential northern black voters and, at the same time, to avoid
                    alienating the southern wing of the party, the support of which was essential for the national
                    ticket. These efforts were, of course, most successful in state and local elections. Moreover, the
                    existence of a real two party system in the North made the appeal for black votes a pragmatic
                    consideration. Unfortunately, it was not usually a case of Democrats offering positive alternatives
                    to blacks so much as it was a case of Republicans taking the black vote for granted and doing
                    nothing to deserve it. "The middle and late 1880's marked the high tide of Negro
                    rebellion against Republican neglect," Grossman states (p. 61). In other words the
                    Republicans lost many black votes by default.</p>
            <p>While Grossman's book displays traces of its origin as a doctoral dissertation—a
                    somewhat lockstep recitation of historical events in precise chronological order and extremely heavy
                    and detailed documentation—it is, nonetheless, written with an obvious concern for
                    engaging the reader's interest. On the negative side Grossman occasionally uses adjectives
                    of questionable accuracy to underline his point, as when he identifies Representative Samuel
                    Sullivan Cox of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> as a racial "moderate" (p. 15). Finally, in setting forth his central
                    thesis in the preface, Grossman either commits a serious <hi rend="i">non sequiter</hi>, or there is
                    a printer's error. After citing <pb n="67" id="VAA4025-073-1-073"/> the commendable
                    northern Democratic success in the "search for Negro support," the author
                    suggests: "Northern Democratic racial liberalism helped to blunt and defeat Republican
                    desires to safeguard Negro suffrage" (p. x).</p>

            <p>Since the appearance of his <hi rend="i">Sod House Frontier</hi> in 1937, Everett Dick has impressed
                    his fellow historians with a vast array of subsequent studies. Here is another volume which will
                    surely become a classic too. It is a study of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                    </placeName> agriculture utilizing the motif of the Great American Desert, a description which was
                    applied erroneously to the area west of the one hundredth meridian during the first three quarters
                    of the nineteenth century. Dick surveys the origin of the desert myth and traces the challenges
                    facing <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                    </placeName> settlers in the period following the Civil War into the early twentieth century.</p>
            <p>West of the one hundredth meridian settlers faced a topography increasingly devoid of trees, the lack
                    of which posed problems with housing, fuel, and fencing. The tale of constructing homes on the
                    treeless plains is fascinatingly told in the chapter on sod construction. Accompanying photographs
                    of sodbusting plows, of the cutting and loading of sod bricks, and of various types of sod houses
                    illustrate the hardships and hazards associated with those early dwellings. The chapter on fencing,
                    drawn from traditional sources, examines the use of sod and osage orange for fences and discusses
                    the impact of barbed wire on the farming and cattle industries. Since timber was also in short
                    supply as a fuel source, settlers resorted to burning corn, hay, and "buffalo
                    chip." However important the sunflower was for <placeName>

                    </placeName> is the Arbor Day festival, first celebrated in that state in 1872. So zealous were
                    Nebraskans in their sylvan devotion that the legislature in 1873 passed a law protecting trees:
                    "In those gun-toting days in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                    </placeName>, if you had something against your neighbor, it was safer to whip out your gun and
                    shoot him than to cut down his trees. You could plead self-defense when you shot someone, and often
                    a killer got away scot-free; but no such subterfuge could be claimed by a tree mutilator. It was the
                    penitentiary for him, according to the law" (p. 120).</p>
            <p>Dick differs with Walter Prescott Webb's view that the windmill is best identified with
                    ranchers on the Great Plains; rather, his research on <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                    </placeName> suggests that the prairie farmer deserves the credit for popularizing these devices. On
                    another controversial point for which extant data are confusing, Dick contends that the temporary
                    decline of settlement in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                    </placeName> during the period from 1873 to 1877 owed more to the national economic depression than
                    to the local grasshopper scourge. The volume concludes with an incisive analysis of irrigation and
                    its effect on <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                    </placeName>'s rural economy up through the recent 1950s.</p>
            <p>In summary, the research for this volume is impressive, and it is written in a refreshingly exciting
                    style. The book is a handsome addition to the <hi rend="i">

                    the approach established by Allan Spear in <hi rend="i">Black <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                        </placeName>
               </hi> (1967), Kusmer develops a broad comparative framework within which he
                    clarifies the origins and rise of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s black community. He retains, however, a sharp focus in discussing the
                    details of that story.</p>
            <p>After a brief introduction to pre-1870 black <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Kusmer divides his book into two large sections. The first, entitled "The
                    Black Community in Transition, 1870–1915," explores such key topics as
                    residence, occupation, income, and civil status among black residents during a period of growing
                    uncertainty. By tracing shifts in black leadership, Kusmer illustrates how changing economic
                    conditions and social attitudes on race undermined the traditionally conservative and
                    assimilationist Negro middle class of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName>. By examining closely the important members of the old elite, such as Charles W.
                    Chesnutt, John P. Green, and Harry C. Smith, Kusmer illuminates the values and tactics of this
                    earlier leadership group. He shows how these individuals were then "challenged by a new
                    group of black businessmen and politicians who relied primarily upon Negro patronage for their
                    success" (p. 140). The newer leaders, whose actual differences with the older leadership
                    were not that great, nevertheless accepted the emerging social and cultural separatism forced on the
                    black community by deepening white hostility.</p>
            <p>In the second half of the book Kusmer documents the impact of black southern migration on black <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The vital socioeconomie statistics are again analyzed, but this time they are examined
                    in relation to a period of rapid population growth and expanding neighborhoods. In a final chapter
                    Kusmer discusses the question of leadership in a ghetto, which is what the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName> black community became after fifteen years of demographic and residential
                    consolidation. He concludes that the new conditions represented a paradox for black Clevelanders:
                    greater group solidarity in the midst of broader social and cultural isolation.</p>
            <p>This work has many attractive features. Kusmer provides extensive comparisons between blacks in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName> and other cities. He also compares similarities and differences between ethnic and
                    black Clevelanders. Twenty-eight statistical tables, largely dealing with occupational data, and a
                        <pb n="70" id="VAA4025-073-1-076"/> bibliographical essay further strengthen this
                    book's claim for serious attention by all those interested in the black urban experience.</p>

            <p>Based primarily on Debs' published writings, <hi rend="i">Eugene V. Debs</hi> is a
                    contribution to <hi rend="i">Twayne's <placeName>

                        </placeName> Authors</hi> series. Harold W. Currie disclaims any attempt at producing another
                    full dress biography of the Socialist leader. His purpose is "to provide for the reader a
                    brief but comprehensive discussion of Debs's ideas, both major and minor, with emphasis on
                    those ideas and attitudes that are most significant in understanding the man and his
                    thought" (p. 10). Currie points out that Debs was not only a great orator but also a
                    prolific writer. Despite the extent of his writings, however, he neither sought nor earned a
                    reputation as a party intellectual or theoretician. His essays were, as Currie phrases it,
                    "colorful, direct, uncomplicated, aimed at the common man rather than at the
                    scholar" (p. 7). With the possible exception of Julius A. Wayland, editor of the <hi rend="i">Appeal to Reason</hi>, Debs probably did more to popularize socialism among American
                    workers than any man who ever lived. What he wrote, however much it lacked intellectual depth,
                    therefore remains of interest to students of the past.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Eugene V. Debs</hi> is organized topically—each chapter dealing with a
                    particular aspect of the Socialist leader's thought or career. Chapter four, for example,
                    entitled "The Debs Style," is subdivided into "The Orator,"
                    "Debs's Use of Language," "Debs's Sense of
                    History," and "The Optimist." Chapter five, "Socialism and the
                    Labor Movement," contains "Socialist Ideas," "Debs and
                    Violence," and "Debs and the Labor Movement." There is nothing in the
                    volume that could not have been learned from Ray Ginger's <hi rend="i">The Bending
                    Cross</hi> (1949), but, in fairness, Currie does not claim otherwise. The book is well written, and
                    its careful organization makes it a convenient guide to Debs' views on most of the
                    important issues of his time.</p>
            <pb n="71" id="VAA4025-073-1-077"/>
            <p>The shortcoming of the book is that the author has tried to do too much in too few pages. This
                    results in a superficial treatment of everything. Too often Currie presents Debs' views
                    without attempting to explain, in any depth, why the Socialist leader held these views or why his
                    position changed over a period of years. For example, in four short paragraphs Currie chronicles
                    Debs' transition from a conservative trade unionist opposed to the use of the strike and
                    boycott to a labor leader who conceded that such weapons were a necessary part of labor's
                    arsenal (pp. 20–21). Yet Currie offers no insights as to why this important change took
                    place in Debs' thinking. Surely readers could expect any addition to the mountain of
                    published material on Debs to offer more than an uninspired repetition of well known facts.
                    Currie's excuse is that it was not his intention "to assess the sources of
                    Debs's ideas, for to do so would necessitate another book-length study" (p. 10).
                    While this may be true, a simple cataloging of Debs' views seems pointless. It would have
                    been better if Currie had selected a single theme (Debs and the labor movement, Debs and industrial
                    unionism) and developed it at length.</p>
            <p>Finally, Currie's assertion that the "fundamental principles behind Debsian
                    Socialism and Americanism are the same, for both profess a belief in equality, individual freedom
                    and democracy" (p. 9) defines both concepts so broadly as to rob them of all meaning.</p>

                        the Century</hi>. By Goran Rystad. (Stockholm, <placeName>

                    Paperbound, Sw. Crs 58:.)</head>
            <p>In this volume Goran Rystad examines American politics from adoption of the peace treaty of 1899,
                    which concluded the Spanish American War and in which the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> acquired a small colonial empire, through the presidential election of 1900, when
                    imperialism occupied a prominent place in political rhetoric. He seeks to determine if foreign
                    policy was the foremost issue in this election, what effect foreign affairs had on politics, and
                    what impact politics <pb n="72" id="VAA4025-073-1-078"/> had on foreign policy. He gives special
                    attention to politics in Indiana, a state which at that time was pivotal in the national election.</p>
            <p>The book is a detailed, at times almost tedious, examination of politicians and politicking, state
                    party conventions and platforms, leading to the national conventions and the presidential contest
                    between William Jennings Bryan and William McKinley. The author shows that
                    imperialism—and politics—was indeed ambiguous and confusing. People supported
                    or opposed imperialism for many reasons, and conflicts often developed within the parties. Democrats
                    in one state sometimes sounded like Republicans in another. Although the Democratic party attacked
                    imperialism as the "paramount issue" in the campaign, Bryan did not propose
                    immediate relinquishment of the Philippine Islands or <placeName>
                        <country reg="pr">Puerto Rico</country>
                    </placeName>, and in parts of the country he scarcely mentioned foreign policy. Because of
                    Bryan's endorsement of free coinage of silver, some dedicated anti-imperialists ended up
                    voting for the other party. The Republican party supported recent American expansion (Republicans
                    would not concede that it was imperialism), but many campaigners preferred to stress economic issues
                    and Bryan's stand on currency. Partly because of these confused circumstances, partly
                    perhaps because of a narrow vision of foreign policy, Americans decided to vote on grounds more
                    familiar than imperialism. The contest of 1900, concludes the author, "was more an election
                    for prosperity and against change than a referendum of the new foreign policy" (p. 309).</p>
            <p>Rystad has produced a useful volume. There are a few problems of style. Writing is occasionally
                    repetitious; sentences frequently are cumbersome; here and there a word is not used
                    properly—problems doubtless fostered by the difficulty of translation. The introduction
                    and first chapter provide excellent summaries of reasons for and interpretations of American
                    expansion. The author maintains admirable objectivity and carefully avoids conclusions not supported
                    by fact. His research is impressive and illustrates the tiresome digging needed for many topics in
                    American history. Rystad has undertaken the difficult task of determing attitudes at a time when
                    there was little in the way of opinion surveys. He examined several manuscript collections and
                    scholarly or semipopular journals; research in newspapers was massive. As a result one finds a great
                    deal <pb n="73" id="VAA4025-073-1-079"/> about attitudes of politicians, newsmen, and leaders from
                    other segments of society—no complete coverage of public opinion but probably the best
                    that could be done. Readers interested in Indiana will enjoy the attention given that state and the
                    generous mention of counties, small towns, and newspapers with which they might identify.</p>
            <p>This book does not determine if Americans in 1900 supported imperialism, but it does suggest some
                    meaningful generalizations about politics and diplomacy. Faced with an issue even as important as
                    imperialism, the people were less concerned with foreign affairs than with domestic issues which
                    affected their immediate interests. Politicians did not hesitate to use foreign policy as a
                    political device to be trumpeted or left alone as the situation seemed to indicate. However
                    uncertain the decision in 1900, so the author concludes, imperialism had attracted so much
                    attention, left so much doubt, that the government was in no mood to embark on future colonialist
                    ventures.</p>

                    century, they represented examples of architecture at various periods, they were neighborhood
                    landmarks, or they were once homes of locally or nationally famous persons (p. x). The text mainly
                    consists of brief sketches focused on the houses pictured. The rapidity with which such houses often
                    disappear is suggested by the observation in an introductory note that a house by house check
                    revealed that only thirty-four of the one hundred houses listed in the 1941 edition were found on
                    the same location when this reprint was prepared. In short, roughly two of these houses, on an
                    average, disappeared each year between 1941 and 1975.</p>

                    mainly on public structures. Tallmadge, himself an architect who was a specialist in church
                    architecture, gives information about construction techniques ranging from how American pioneers
                    notched logs to make the corners of log cabins to the "skeleton construction" plan
                    for building skyscrapers. A limited number of illustrations is used, but they are less significant
                    than the text itself.</p>

                    service to scholars and lay readers alike by summarizing much of what is known about the role of the
                    West Indian islands in the mainland colonies' drive for independence. The theme of the book
                    is trade and the continuing economic interdependence of the West Indies and the mainland colonies.
                    This interdependence was both a cause of the American Revolution and a guarantor of its success.
                    Moreover, by surviving both the mercantile restrictions of empire and the machinations of the
                    imperialists, the economic ties between the mainland and the West Indian islands proved just as
                    significant as ideology in hastening the decline of the European overseas empires. The book also
                    provides an important bicentennial tribute to historians of the era by successfully combining the
                    accumulated scholarship of over three quarters of a century into a story which is both readable and
                    coherent. <hi rend="i">Paul R. Lucas, Indiana University, <placeName>

                    included in this <hi rend="i">Biographical Dictionary</hi>. Particular emphasis was given to
                    representatives of trade unions, but an effort was made to obtain a representative group of
                    "labor-oriented" politicians, editors, radicals, etc. (p. xii). The usefulness of
                    this pioneering work is enhanced by the inclusion of bibliographical material about persons
                    sketched. Unfortunately an examination of two entries uncovered some disturbing errors of fact.
                    Robert Dale Owen was not "elected to the Indiana legislature for three terms, 1832-1838;
                    defeated in 1838 and 1840, but elected to the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Congress as a Democrat in 1842 and served two terms" (p. 280). Instead, he was
                    elected to the legislature for one year terms in 1836, 1837, and 1838; for a two year term in 1851;
                    and to Congress in 1843 and 1845, serving in this body from 1843 to 1847. Further, Powers Hap-good
