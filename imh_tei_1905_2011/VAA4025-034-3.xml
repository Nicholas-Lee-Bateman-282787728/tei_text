                    Colfax. He was born in <placeName>

                    </placeName> City on March 23, 1823. His paternal grandfather was General William Colfax, who, in

                    Colfax married Hester Schuyler, a cousin of General Philip Schuyler. On the maternal side the
                    ancestry of Schuyler Colfax included the La Masters and Strykers.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> His mother
                    was a Stryker. His father died a few months before the son was born. In 1834 Mrs. Colfax married
                    George W. Matthews of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>

                    </placeName> City. He did not go far in the attainment of a formal education and often referred in
                    later life to his training in the school of experience.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The year 1836 found the Matthews family contributing their part to the great westward movement of the
                    period. Traveling by way of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Buffalo</settlement>

                    </placeName>. Here young Schuyler Colfax spent the next five years clerking in his
                    step-father's store and doing farm work in the surrounding community. The Matthews house
                    was used for a Sunday school in which the step-father, mother and son were teachers.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> It is well to mention this in passing as the religious environment of Colfax had its
                    influence on his later life.</p>

            <p>In 1841 the Matthews family moved to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> which remained the home of Schuyler Colfax until his death in 1885. Before locating in
                    the city, Mr. Matthews had been elected Auditor of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                    </placeName> County on the Whig ticket. Young Schuyler was appointed Deputy-Auditor by Mr. Matthews.
                    Interested in politics ever since he was a lad, his opportunities for studying the game were now
                    greater than ever. He was expected to study law, which he did rather spasmodically, but apparently
                    never intended to take it up as a profession. "Other subjects," he stated,
                    interfered too much with his study. One of these other "subjects" was a love
                    affair with Miss Evelyn Clark of Argyle, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, whom he later married.</p>
            <p>Another matter which interfered with the study of law was politics. The call to party activity was
                    too strong. In debating clubs, mock legislatures and mock courts he and his friends fought out the
                    issues of the day. Forces had played upon him from the beginning that made of him a steadfast Whig.
                    His correspondence shows that relatives and friends often encouraged him to stand fast in the Whig
                        faith.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Interest in newspapers and journalism started at an early date. From youth on it was a common sight
                    in the home to see Schuyler sprawled out on the floor poring over a newspaper. Nothing seemed to
                    interest him more than the political events of the day. Not satisfied merely to read papers, he felt
                    the urge to write articles. At the age of sixteen, he began writing for local papers and two years
                    later he made arrangements with Horace Greeley to send in articles for the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Tribune.</hi> "I shall be happy," Greeley wrote, "to hear
                    from you on the terms so generously proposed by you as often as you think proper. … Write

                    </placeName> in Colfax made him a reformer. One of the reforms in which he was personally interested
                    was that of temperance. A Total Abstinence Society was started in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the early eighteen-forties and grew rapidly. Colfax took the pledge of a tee-totaler
                    sometime in 1842. To his fiancée, Miss Evelyn Clark, he announced that "since my
                    return West I have taken an inward pledge against drinking any kind of liquor. Thus far I have kept
                    it strictly, and in all my gayety and blithesomeness no temptation shall ever lead me to pollute my
                    lips with the liquid fire."<hi rend="sup">8</hi> It appears that this pledge was never
                    broken, but reforms of this kind could go too far, Colfax thought. On one occasion he and a few
                    other youngsters pledged themselves to abstain from smoking for three months in order to test their
                    moral fortitude. When congratulated for abandoning smoking he replied: <text>
                  <body>
                     <div type="letter">
                        <p>You congratulate me on abandoning smoking, but the pledge expired last week, and we
                                    have all been gloriously smoking ever since. One of the members broke the pledge; we
                                    tried and convicted him, and turned him out, and fined him one hundred Spanish
                                    cigars, which will last us some time. I don't think it does me much harm,
                                    if any, and I guess I won't join another anti-tobacco society soon.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>
                        </p>
                     </div>
                  </body>
               </text> It seems that this pledge too was kept, for Colfax is believed to have been second only to
                    Ulysses S. Grant when it came to smoking.</p>
            <p>During the winter of 1842–43, Colfax had further experience as a newspaper reporter. He
                    went to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

                    latter's home, Colfax found a storm-center of Whig politics, so he was now in his
                        element.<hi rend="sup">10</hi>

                    Convention—Colfax serving as Chairman of the Resolutions Committee—he
                    continued: "You will see (they) are of the most ultra character; for I am an uncompromising

            </p>
            <p>It will be seen by the foregoing that by 1845, Colfax was not a new-comer in the field of journalism.
                    But in this year, his most important venture in the field was launched. He and Albert W. West
                    purchased the <placeName>

                        Register,</hi> with Colfax as editor. It was to be issued weekly. Said the editor in the first
                    issue: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>In presenting ourselves before you as the conductors of this paper, custom demands, and
                            inclination requires, that we should set forth as briefly as possible, our intentions as to
                            its future course. In <hi rend="i">Politics,</hi> we shall be inflexibly Whig, believing
                            those principles the best and safest and wisest for the administration of our Government.
                            With an abiding confidence that, sooner or later, those principles will gloriously and
                            permanently triumph, we shall labor for them as zealously and faithfully when the prospect
                            is dimmed by defeat or reverses, as when it is lit up by the sunshine of Victory.</p>
                    </quote> The language used in defending these principles, however, would be such as to offend no
                    reasonable opponent, the young Whig editor rashly declared.</p>
            <p>As to the state debt the editor asserted that he would advocate the side of honesty against
                    repudiation. He conceded that the state might not be able to pay every cent of the interest
                    immediately. But common justice, he thought, demanded that as much of it as possible should be paid.
                    "This done, we could all feel that the shame and blight-spot on our State's credit
                    and fame had passed away. … We shall advocate a prompt settlement of the
                    matter."</p>
            <p>On the slavery issue, which was shortly to become still more important, a position between the
                    extremes was announced: "We shall be opposed both to Calhounism and Birneyism, viewing them
                    both as ultraisms. … " The editor condemned Calhoun for holding that slavery was

                    criticized the Liberty Party more because he thought its position prevented calm and argumentative
                    discussion in the South and thus tended to rivet the chains of the slave more firmly. He was opposed
                    to any extension of slave territory, however, and declared he would hail the day when the southern

            <p>Colfax thought it necessary to reply editorially to the statement that the <hi rend="i">Register

                    hundred fifty its circulation quadrupled in a few years. In the spring of 1846, Colfax became sole
                    proprietor. On September 10, 1847, the editor announced an enlargement of the paper and expressed
                    the hope that it would now meet with still greater support. The <hi rend="i">Register</hi> was now
                    about the size of the <hi rend="i">Indiana State Journal</hi> and the only seven-column paper north

            <p>Rev. A. Y. Moore, a fellow-townsman and friend of Colfax, later characterized the <hi rend="i">Register</hi> in high terms: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The Register was a pure paper. It did not carry the delineations of the revolting and
                            demoralizing scenes of crime into the households it visited. It was the advocate of good
                            things; an earnest, ardent advocate of temperance, and the things that build up society.

            <p>As suggested in this rating, the interest of Colfax in the temperance movement was not a mere
                    youthful flash in the pan. Not a little space in the paper was given to it. Colfax himself became
                    secretary of a County Total Abstinence Society.<hi rend="sup">19</hi> His editorial interests were
                    quite broad, however. As was the case with the typical newspaper of the times, subjects of current

                    that he refused "most obstinately" to accept any of the bargains urged on him by
                    the Democrats, and to the refusal of some Democrats to support him as he had expected. He thought
                    also that it was a strategic mistake for four-fifths of the Whigs to vote for him on the first
                        ballot.<hi rend="sup">22</hi> He remained in <placeName>

                    contacts with the leading men of the state and no doubt used them to good political advantage. But
                    because of a smallpox scare among the legislators he found himself back at his editorial duties in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>

                    </placeName>, became ill with the smallpox, but before the nature of his illness was known many of
                    the other legislators had visited him in his sick room. When the truth became known something akin
                    to panic struck the legislators and there followed a rather hasty and undignified retreat in every

            <p>The position which Colfax took on the issues growing out of the Mexican War need not be gone into at
                    great length for his position is not surprising. It was what one would expect of a northern Whig. In
                    September, 1845, he thought President Polk's course "judicious and
                    moderate" in the main, and believed war not very likely. Yet he had fears that the
                    President would not be able to withstand the "`spirit of the age'—a
                    spirit of mobs, of bloodspilling, of ravage and of war."<hi rend="sup">25</hi> After war
                    broke out, the tone of the <hi rend="i">Register</hi> editorials changed. Colfax contended that the
                    war was due to the annexation of <placeName>

                    followed the war could still have been prevented. Now that the <placeName>

                    Colfax pursued a course in the first war which he vigorously denounced in the second. Democratic

                    later of the <hi rend="i">Register</hi> in particular declared to the editor that "your

                    of disloyalty on the part of the Whigs saying "every pulsation of our heart is <hi rend="i">for</hi> our country."<hi rend="sup">28</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The columns of the <hi rend="i">Register</hi> reflect the renewed discussion of slavery which came
                    with the war. No one, said the editor, desired more than he to see the day when there would not be a
                    slave in America. "But we constantly notice with sinsere [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] regret
                    … that the ultra stand taken and ultra measures proposed by citizens of the North, banded
                    together into a political party for this single object (abolishing slavery), are throwing obstacles
                    into the way which it will be difficult, if not impossible, to surmount." He thought the
                    political abolitionists, if sincere, would temper their plans "with moderation instead of
                        ultraism."<hi rend="sup">29</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Colfax was adamant on the further extension of slave territory. The cry of the North, he said,
                    should be: "Not another inch of Slave territory." He praised the House of
                    Representatives which passed the Wilmot Proviso as being true to the impulses of freedom. If the
                    slaveholding states, he held, were girdled with a belt of freedom it would in time mean the death of
                    the "peculiar institution."<hi rend="sup">30</hi>

                    Colfax had been sure that the country had disgraced itself in 1844 when it refused to elect <placeName>

                    the first choice if he could be elected, Colfax perceived that the Mexican War might be helping the
                    Whigs to solve their nomination problem in 1848. Various favorable articles and editorials about
                    General Taylor were published long before the Whig National Convention of 1848. However, the failure
                    of Taylor to come out in no uncertain terms as a thorough-going Whig cooled Colfax's ardor
                    somewhat as it did that of some others. Some of the friends of Colfax wrote him that Taylor should
                    not be the Whig nominee. John D. Defrees, for example, argued that "Henry <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> cannot be nominated or elected, and General Zachary Taylor ought not to be, because he
                    will not pledge himself to carry out Whig principles if elected."<hi rend="sup">31</hi>
                    Horace Greeley wrote in April, 1848, that <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> was the man who ought to be nominated. "We cannot with any decency support

                    the compromise, the dissent of the <hi rend="i">Register</hi> was still more marked.<hi rend="sup">42</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was in the midst of the struggle over the compromise measures of 1850 that President Taylor died.
                    "At such a crisis as this," said Colfax in the <hi rend="i">Register,</hi>
                    "it is difficult to acquiesce in the will of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Providence</settlement>
                    </placeName>." He thought Fillmore would prove no Tyler but he was nevertheless somewhat
                        disturbed.<hi rend="sup">43</hi> But with the adoption of the compromise measures and in line
                    with the comparative calm which followed, Colfax too expressed moderate sentiments and became for a
                    while pretty much of a "finality Whig."</p>
            <p>In the meantime Colfax was called to serve in a new capacity—that of delegate from his
                    district to the Indiana Constitutional Convention of 1850–1851. This body met in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> on October 7. For some time before 1850, editorials had appeared in the <hi rend="i">Register</hi> defining the editor's position on constitutional questions. He thought
                    the time a good one inasmuch as party strife was not then strong. "There is a happier era
                    of Toleration commenced." No "party will strive to engraft its ultraisms upon
                        it."<hi rend="sup">44</hi> He advocated a non-partisan convention including a
                    non-partisan election of delegates but was defeated in this respect.<hi rend="sup">45</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He issued a circular on constitutional reform stating it was his duty to present his views in order
                    that the people might know his position. In it he noted that although his plan for a non-partisan
                    convention was not adopted he promised nevertheless to recognize its spirit. He was of the opinion
                    that the constitution should be brief—"an instrument of principles rather than
                    of laws." In order to protect the family and unfortunate debtors, homesteads, he held,

                    the state had taught it that no debt should be incurred without a vote of the people. He was opposed
                    to the doctrine of "no banks," but he was not in favor of giving exclusive banking
                    privileges to one institution. He was, rather, in favor of free banks. The grand jury ought to be
                    retained, he held. He was opposed to granting the right of suffrage to negroes, largely on grounds
                    of expediency, it seems. He was opposed also to forcibly exiling them. Elimination of the
                    "jargons" and "technicalities" of the laws of the state was also
                    favored. "I am in favor of Temperance, and expect to remain so through life," he
                    stated. But he was not in favor of a constitutional provision relative to the policy. Finally, he
                    was in favor of provisions declaring for no slavery, no imprisonment for debt, and no divorces by
                    the legislature. He promised to endeavor, if elected, to justify the confidence placed in him and to

            <p>When Colfax arrived at the Capital he reported in his editorial correspondence that Democrats were in
                    control by a large majority. Whigs could not even get one assistant doorkeeper appointed, and
                    "There is not the remotest taint of Whiggery in any of the officers from the President to
                    the fireman." To him the political emphasis on things did not augur well for future
                        deliberations.<hi rend="sup">47</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One of the youngest members of the convention, Colfax took an active part in its work and showed
                    considerable ability as a debater and parliamentarian. He was appointed on the Committees on
                    Currency and Banking and on Public Institutions of the State.<hi rend="sup">48</hi> One of the
                    subjects in which Colfax interested himself and on which he debated was that of the rights of
                    negroes. He favored submitting to the people for a separate vote the question whether negroes should
                    be given the right of suffrage. He was willing to let the people decide the issue though he, for
                    reasons satisfactory to himself, would not vote in favor of such a proposition. He thought, too,

                    "to follow where-ever duty leads, regardless of what may be the temporary verdict upon the
                    question, and I shall not shrink here or now from any responsibility I have assumed." The
                    suffrage referendum proposal was voted down by 62 to 60<hi rend="sup">50</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The proposal to keep free negroes from coming into the state likewise brought forth some oratorical
                    flights on the part of Colfax: "Mr. President, do as we may here, our action is not final.
                    Sooner or later this case will receive a fairer hearing, and calmer consideration at the bar of
                    public opinion. That judgment if we would we cannot escape."<hi rend="sup">51</hi> He would
                    oppose injustice anywhere whether it emanted from a despot or "from a popular majority
                    which has become lost to sense of right."<hi rend="sup">52</hi> In his editorial
                    correspondence he reported that on this question the delegates from the northern tier of counties,
                    regardless of party, voted but one way.<hi rend="sup">53</hi> His views sounded like a rather far
                    cry for that day, but they were nearer fulfillment than was realized at the time.</p>
            <p>Exempting homesteads from foreclosure proceedings was another proposal which Colfax warmly defended.
                    In his plea for taking care of the poor because "they have a special claim upon us for our
                    protection" he sounded distinctly modern. The arguments of those who opposed this sounded
                    very much like those used to-day by our alleged reactionaries.<hi rend="sup">54</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One of the subjects on which the Convention had difficulty in agreeing was that of banking. There
                    were state-bank men, free-bank men and no-bank men. After many efforts Colfax had the satisfaction
                    of contributing considerable in the way of proposing compromise measures which a sufficient number
                    could agree on to adopt. The <hi rend="i">State Journal</hi> remarked that "to have been
                    the pacificator of this important measure is certainly creditable to Mr. Colfax, and is evidence of

            </p>

            <p>Scarcely had Colfax gotten back to his regular editorial duties when he again had extraneous
                    interests to look after. Indeed while in the convention, the question had been broached. A number of
                    his friends suggested that he ought to run for Congress in 1851. In a "strictly, sacredly
                    confidential" letter to a friend in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> he asked for advice, and weighed the pros and cons. In favor of it, he thought the
                    position "very honorable" and regarded the pay as "comfortable
                        withal."<hi rend="sup">57</hi> Though he wrote in the <hi rend="i">Register</hi> on May
                    1 that the Whig candidate is not as yet agreed upon, he must have had a pretty good idea who he
                    would be, for on May 28, 1851, the district convention nominated him unanimously and praised him for
                    not being an extremist. The resolutions passed admitted that there was a difference among Whigs on
                    the compromise measures of 1850 though all were for obedience to law, and were for carrying them out
                    until "Time and Experience shall show that a Change or Modification of them is necessary to
                    avoid evasion or abuse."<hi rend="sup">58</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dr. Graham N. Fitch, then representing the district, was nominated by the Democrats. While the odds
                    seemed against Colfax, he entered vigorously into the canvass, engaging in joint debates with his
                    opponent. Thinking that "propriety, as well as necessity" required that he retire
                    from the editorship of the <hi rend="i">Register</hi> during the canvass, Mr. James Davis again
                    became acting-editor.</p>
            <p>The differences between the two candidates on the issues of the day were not great. Both parties in
                    the district and both candidates seem to have been influenced by the current emphasis on the
                    finality of the compromise measures as the solution of the slavery issue. A local Anti-Slavery and
                    Free-Soil convention addressed letters to both Colfax and Fitch on the slavery question and received
                    similar replies. Colfax said he could not close his eyes to the right of the southern master to
                    recapture his slave. The Fugitive Slave Law might be unnecessarily harsh but he could not pledge
                    himself to <list type="footnotes">

                    judicial decisions the western territories would be free without the necessity of legislation.<hi rend="sup">59</hi> In short his position in this period was indeed very moderate. That of Fitch,
                    who in 1849 had, it was said, "out-free-soiled" the Free-Soilers in order to get
                    their votes, was similarly moderate.<hi rend="sup">60</hi> The answers of these candidates were not
                    satisfactory to the Free-Soilers. One opposition editor in the district remarked that the Whigs
                    "pretty much `go the whole hog' on the subject of Fugitiveism and
                        Fillmoreism."<hi rend="sup">61</hi>

            <p>This same editor, Ellis of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Goshen</settlement>
                    </placeName>, twitted the Whig candidate on his youth saying he had better "tarry at
                    Jericho `till his beard grows."<hi rend="sup">62</hi> In one of the first debates with
                    Colfax, Dr. Fitch likewise, it is said, cast aspersion upon Colfax's youth repeating the
                    jibe about tarrying at Jericho. Amid derisive shouts of laughter Fitch retired and Colfax came
                    forward to speak. After looking over the audience he made this retort: "I was not aware, my
                    fellow-citizens, that brass and beard were necessary qualifications of a Congressman. If, in your
                    judgment, it is so, I must renounce all hopes of your votes, as I confess, what you cannot but see,
                    that my competitor has a superabundance of both." On one occasion, Fitch attempted to
                    incite prejudice against his opponent by reminding the audience of Colfax's position in the
                    constitutional convention on the rights of negroes, though it seems there had been an agreement not
                    to mention these matters.<hi rend="sup">63</hi> Colfax in turn mentioned his understanding of the
                    agreement and added that those were his conscientious convictions which he would not give up for a
                    seat in Congress.<hi rend="sup">64</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the eve of the election, the <hi rend="i">Register</hi> remarked that "no great party

                    between men."<hi rend="sup">65</hi> The choice was Dr. Fitch, though only by about 200
                    majority. Colfax attributed his defeat to "illegal voting in the Rail Road Counties, and
                    Whig defection in the County of our competitor."<hi rend="sup">66</hi> It seems too that

            </p>
            <p>In the fall of this same year Colfax was engaged in still another activity outside the journalistic
                    field. Having been an active member of the Odd Fellows fraternal order for some years, he became a
                    leading spirit in the establishing of the Degree of Rebekah, ladies' auxiliary of the
                    order. At the session of the Grand Lodge of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1850, Colfax was appointed chairman of a committee to consider the matter and report
                    at the next meeting. He had previously suggested the idea of a <hi rend="i">Ladies'
                    Degree.</hi> A majority of the committee was opposed, but the next Grand Lodge adopted the minority
                    report which he made. In the words of one writer, the report "was suggested and originated
                    by Schuyler Colfax … by whom also it was written."<hi rend="sup">68</hi>
                    "Brother Colfax deserves, as he has received, the sincere thanks of the Fraternity, for
                    this ornament to the building which our fathers framed."<hi rend="sup">69</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the meantime, the Whig editor of the <hi rend="i">Register</hi> took an early interest in the
                    presidential campaign of 1852. In February of 1851, noting that Indiana Democrats were pushing the
                    presidential fortunes of General Joseph Lane, he reported that the Whigs "believe that the
                    only Lane that is to be President, is old Lundy's Lane, and they have, with a more entire
                    unanimity, "nominated Gen. Scott." Because of Scott's victories
                    "on the frozen soil of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>

                        <country reg="mx">Mexico</country>
                    </placeName>," this young Whig editor thought he heard the call strong and clear from every
                    section of the Union to elevate another warrior-statesman to the Presidency.<hi rend="sup">70</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As in 1848, Colfax was a delegate to the Whig National Convention. He believed Scott to be safe on
                    the slavery issue, and thought that he would not make devotion to the Compromise of 1850 a
                    shibboleth of party faith.<hi rend="sup">71</hi> He held that Scott should not be pinned down with
                    controversial issues but should be taken on faith as Taylor was four years <list type="footnotes">

                    apparently played quite a leading part in getting Scott nominated. On one point of strategy, he
                    differed with William H. Seward and the other members of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> degelation. The idea of Colfax was that Scott's letter on the compromise which
                    had been prepared and which was to be given in accepting the nomination should be read first in
                    order to attract some Southern voters.<hi rend="sup">73</hi> He seemed to have been right in this as
                    no delegate south of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> came to Scott's support until the letter was read, Scott finally being
                    nominated on the fifty-third ballot. The Whig platform endorsed the compromise measures of 1850 as
                    did that of the Democratic party.<hi rend="sup">74</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Colfax was active in the campaign. He tried to make the platform as palatable as possible and
                    contended that in any case the North got what was more valuable than the platform, namely, the <hi rend="i">candidate.</hi> The price of the <hi rend="i">Register</hi> for the campaign was again
                    reduced. All the battles Scott ever engaged in were again re-fought in the pages of the <hi rend="i">Register</hi> and gloriously won. He was vigorously defended against all charges including
                    those that said he was a Catholic and that he was a nativist. The Whigs went down in defeat in that
                    election and were never, as events proved, to rise again. Possibly sensing defeat, and remembering
                    the coolness of the President towards him, as evidenced again by a recent removal of his father from
                    the postmastership of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Colfax turned down a nomination as the Whig candidate for the House of
                        Representatives.<hi rend="sup">75</hi> The Whigs nominated Horace P. Biddle who was defeated.</p>
            <p>The defeat of Scott was, of course, a keen disappointment to the zealous Whig editor of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Register.</hi> He spoke with some bitterness about the conduct of certain Whigs,
                    including a number of the friends of the late Daniel Webster's, who voted for Pierce rather
                    than for Scott. To his subscribers he announced that "the <hi rend="i">Register</hi> will,
                    we need scarcely say, remain Whig to the backbone. … We shall stand by the Whig banner to

            <p>Confident in this hope, Colfax preceeded with his journalistic efforts, putting forth an effort to

                    circulation was the largest of any paper in Northern Indiana. The prospectus stated that no new
                    pledges need be given as to its course. Its promise is in its past record. "We have made
                    our paper the reflex of our heart. It will relax not one jot in its attachment to its old

            <p>Writing in August, 1853, Colfax referred to the "political calm which happily

            <p>In the Spring of 1937, it was the writer's good fortune to be appointed to investigate the
                    rumor that there was a lot for destitute teachers in Crown Hill Cemetery in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. After checking a single reference, he was quite sure that such a burial ground had at
                    one time existed. On arriving at the cemetery office he presented the following inquiry:
                    "Can you tell me, Mr. Myers, whether you have a lot, a very old one, perhaps, called a lot
                    for destitute teachers and designated on the books as `Lot 30, Section 3?'" Mr.
                    Myers replied that he did not know personally of such a lot, but evidently the old records would
                    give the desired information.</p>
            <p>There it was, top the page, "A Lot for the Destitute Teachers of the Public
                    Schools." Below the title was a diagram of the plot, with the graves outlined and numbered.
                    Spaces were provided for twelve graves, seven of which were occupied. Below the diagram on the same
                    page was a list of those who were buried there: <list type="simple">
                  <item>Ella P. Coffin, 1874.</item>
                  <item>Anna M. Tyler (sister), 1874</item>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>"Alexander Ralston," exclaimed the author, "what is he doing on a lot for
                    destitute teachers? The man who designed and surveyed the downtown district of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He was neither a teacher nor was he destitute. And neither was John B. Dillon, one of
                    the city's early attorneys and a worthy historian." Mr. Myers was as nonplussed as
                    the questioner and rapidly became equally interested. He proposed a drive to the location. There
                    were the graves, all marked with a variety of stones, bearing names and dates, except one, the grave
                    of Alexander Ralston. No stick or stone marked his resting place—there was only the
                    outline of a grave in the green sod.</p>
            <p>John B. Dillon has a large stone monument which is ten feet high and six feet square at the base.
                    Such a marker on a lot for the destitute adds a bit of incongruity to the scene. Question after
                    question came to mind. "How does the designer <list type="footnotes">

                    these other people? How does there happen to be a lot for destitute teachers? When was there such
                    need? Who, if anyone, beside the cemetery association, furnished the ground?"</p>
            <p>The writer took up the question of the identity of each of the persons buried on the lot. This work
                    required a study of the Crown Hill records, the city papers in the state library, teachers'
                    directories at the main school office, the city directories at the city library, the funeral records
                    at the Kregelo-Bailey undertaking establishment, and the proceedings of the Common Council of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The cemetery records show that Ella P. Coffin died May 30, 1870, at the age of
                    twenty-three. The date of her burial in Crown Hill was April 18, 1874. On that same date her sister,
                    Anna M. Tyler, was laid beside her. She too had been dead for quite a period—since August
                    11, 1870. She was twenty-seven years of age at the time of her death. An examination of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> for the dates of these deaths revealed the following item: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Ella P. Coffin, a principle [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] teacher of the 4th ward, died yesterday
                            at 10:00 o'clock. Funeral services at home Wednesday, 262 North East Street.</p>
                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>Though this was a meager bit of information, it was very significant, because Ella Coffin and her
                    sister were the first to be placed on the lot, and the former, was a teacher in the city schools.
                    The fact that she was not buried there until four years after her death would indicate that she and
                    her relatives were without the means to be independent in the matter of burial. Furthermore, a note
                    on the funeral record at Crown Hill showed that Mr. A. C. Shortridge, then Superintendent of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Schools, paid $16.00 for the burial of the two sisters.</p>
            <p>Work on the identification of the others continued. The cemetery records and the books of the
                    Kregelo-Bailey undertaking establishment showed that George McKinney died on September 3, 1889; was
                    buried September 5, 1889; died at <pb n="285" id="VAA4025-034-3-027"/> the age of thirty of liver
                    trouble; and that a Dr. Wood-burn was the attending physician. Mr. Kregelo, as undertaker, paid the
                    cemetery $15.00, and was reimbursed by an equal amount by Mrs. McKinney and a C. J.
                    Linton. The vital statistics of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Sentinel</hi> confirmed these dates, but no further mention was made of the death in
                    the papers. The name of George McKinney was not found in the teachers' directory for any
                    year of the 1880's.</p>
            <p>Records showed that William Lentz, a bachelor, died of tuberculosis October 4, 1889, and was buried
                    two days later in the lot for destitute teachers. He was thirty-three at the time of his death. His
                    name did not appear in the teachers' directories.</p>
            <p>The other occupant unknown to the investigator was Catherine Messing. Records revealed that Mrs.
                    Messing died January 23, 1891, and was buried on January 26. As in the cases above, Dr. Woodburn was
                    the physician, Kregelo the undertaker. In each case the undertaker paid the cemetery association
                    $15 and was reimbursed by friends or relatives. As in the case of the foregoing,
                    Catherine Messing's name was not to be found in the directory of teachers.</p>
            <p>The city directories for the 1880's settled the question of the occupations of George
                    McKinney, William Lentz, and Catherine Messing. All were listed as mechanics or laborers. No record
                    was found which might explain why they were buried in the lot for destitute teachers.</p>

            <p>From original manuscripts, letters, state papers, and the reminiscences of old settlers, he pieced
                    together the history of early Indiana. It is fortunate for the later historians that he did so,

            <p>Mr. Dillon's books had no sale value, and he was always faced with poverty. His friends
                    managed to keep him in minor political offices from which he received some remuneration. He lived in

                    George S. Cottman epitomizes the life of this man as follows. "Forty years of honest
                    conscientious devotion; four books that people would not buy, and death in a lonely garret, face to
                    face with grim poverty, because he wrought for the love of truth and not for dollars—this

                    to have a board of twelve directors. The first list of directors included the names of George Clark,

            <p>It was not safe for the expedition to come too near Natchez, so the flotilla stopped about thirty

                    river in a light boat so that he might learn exactly what had happened. These two scouts spent the
                    night of January 11, 1807, with a Dr. John F. Carmichael<hi rend="sup">8</hi> near Fort Adams. Dr.
                    Carmichael later testified that Ralston revealed to him that the expedition was directed against

            <p>Davis Floyd was tried in the territorial court of Indiana for his part in the fiasco, was convicted,

                    of his expedition, the question of the motives behind Ralston's participation presents even
                    greater difficulties. Admirers of Alexander Ralston have said that his connection with the Burr
                    fiasco was merely that of a surveyor, employed for the purpose of surveying the Bastrop Lands on the

                    they chose the site at the junction of <placeName>

                    </placeName> and the West Fork of the White River. The legislature ratified their selection on
                    January 6, 1821, and appointed three commissioners to lay out the city. The appointees were James W.
                    Jones, Samuel P. Booker and Christopher Harrison. The resolution provided that the commissioners
                    should meet on the site the first Monday in April and plan the town on "such lines as they
                    conceive will be advantageous to the state and to the prosperity of such town, having specially in
                    view the health, utility, and beauty of the place." Christopher Harrison of <placeName>

                    </placeName> came alone to the appointed place and selected Alexander Ralston, his fellow townsman,
                    and Elias Pym Fordham, of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, to survey and plan the new city.</p>
            <p>Statements made by contemporaries of Ralston indicate that he was largely responsible for the plan of
                    present downtown <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. There is considerable evidence to support this view and careful historians refer to
                    the plan as the "Ralston plat".<hi rend="sup">15</hi> The perfect geometric
                    symmetry of his "mile square" with its circle and radiating avenues show the
                    influence of his experience in surveying the capital of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Ralston thought that to plat an area of one square mile would be sufficient for the time. This area
                    was bounded by East, West, North and South Streets, although he did not name these streets on his
                    plan. With few exceptions the interior of the "mile square" is exactly as it was
                    on the Ralston plat of 1821. This plat provided for a municipal recreation park along
                    Pogue's Run, bounded on the north by <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName> Street and on the south by <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName> Street It is apparent that the growing metropolis could not long permit a park of that
                    size to stand in the way of its industrial development, and it was soon intersected by streets and
                    railroads. In 1894, the city council changed Ralston's names for <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>

                    </placeName> Streets to Senate Avenue and Capitol Avenue, respectively.</p>
            <p>Great credit is due the foresight of the designer of the "mile square" that he
                    platted the streets ninety feet wide with the exception of <placeName>

                    designed by Ralston that one finds narrow streets, "one side" parking and
                    dangerous jogs. Ralston provided that each block not intersected by an avenue should be cut by
                    alleys, fifteen to thirty feet wide. These alleys are of course indispensable to the delivery

                            original survey of it. In the latter part of his life he was our county surveyor, and his
                            leisure time was employed in attending to a neat garden, in which various useful and
                            ornamental plants, fruits, etc., were carefully cultivated. Mr. Ralston was skilful in his
                            profession, honest in his dealings, gentlemanly in his deportment, a liberal and hospitable
                            citizen, a sincere and ardent friend. The respect and esteem of the generous and the good
                            were always awarded to him, and he found constant satisfaction in conferring favors not only
                            on his own species, but even on the humblest of the brute creation. "He would not
                            willingly set foot upon a worm." But his unsuspecting nature made him liable to
                            imposition; his sanguine expectations were often disappointed, his independent spirit
                            sometimes provoked opposition, and his extreme sensibility was frequently put to the
                            severest trials. Though he stood alone amongst us, as it respects family, his loss will be
                            long lamented.</p>

                            steps up to a small platform before the door of the center room. Mr. Ralston was here some
                            time before we were. I saw him often. He was so slender that he looked rather tall to a
                            child of six years. He <pb n="292" id="VAA4025-034-3-034"/> was always dressed in taste, I
                            should say, as a gentleman should be. One day, taking me by the hand, he said: "You
                            must have a pole for your martin box. We will go and find one." So we took a long
                            walk down the road to the thick woods and picked out one. When we were coming home he said:
                            "You must be very tired. Come in and rest while I read you a story." While
                            I rested he sat in an old-fashioned chair, a rest for his Bible at his right hand. From this

                        <p>Yesterday afternoon at 3 o'clock, the committee appointed by the Common Council to
                            superintend the removal of the remains of Alexander Ralston, the surveyor of the original

                            by David Kregelo. There were present during the afternoon, Mr. J. H. B. Nowland, wife and
                            daughter, Mrs. P. B. L. Nowland, Mary S. Cowger, Isaac N. Phipps and wife, Mrs. White,

                        <p>The remains were found on the spot designated last spring by the venerable George Norwood, on
                            the river bank near the southwest corner of the cemetery. The burial of Mr. Ralston took
                            place nearly forty-eight years ago, in the year 1827, and at that time graves were dug much
                            deeper than they are now. Yesterday afternoon the laborers became well nigh discouraged, as
                            did also several of the spectators, before they came to the level upon which the coffin was
                            laid. As Mr. Nowland remembered General Ralston, he was a man six feet in height or more,
                            and when the grave diggers came upon a human thigh-bone it was decided, from its length, to
                            be that of Mr. Ralston. The rest of the bones were exhumed (all vestiges of a coffin had
                            long ago disappeared) and were placed in a casket. The company then repaired to Crown Hill,
                            where the casket was buried in a grave on a beautiful sloping bank, just west of the
                            soldiers' graves, donated for the purpose by the Crown Hill Cemetery authorities.
                            There were no formal ceremonies, and when the last clod fell into the newly made grave the
                            company retired.</p>
                        <p>The work of the committee is but half done. They will now inquire into and report upon the
                            probable cost of erecting a suitable monument over the spot, and also have prepared a sketch
                            of Mr. Ralston's life, by George Norwood and J. H. B. Nowland, and a suitable
                            memorial to place upon the monument. The committee will proceed in this matter with the same
                            dispatch that has already characterized their movements."</p>

            <p>At the next meeting of the city council, Mr. Darnell proposed an amendment to the list of claims
                    under consideration to provide for an appropriation of $10.50 to pay for the removal of
                    Ralston's body.</p>
            <p>Mr. Ralston's remains were interred in a plot of ground <pb n="294" id="VAA4025-034-3-036"/>
                    set aside as the "Lot for Destitute Teachers of the Public Schools"—Lot
                    30-Section 3. This site was chosen both because of its beautiful location and because of the
                    probability that few of the twelve graves provided would be needed for the purpose originally
                    intended.</p>
            <p>In a meeting of the City Council of January 4, 1875, Councilman Darnell reported as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>As chairman of the special committee appointed by his honor to ascertain the cost of a
                            monument to be erected to the memory of Alexander Ralston I herewith submit designs and
                            prices of the same for your consideration. Also in reference to the identity of the remains
                            of Mr. Ralston I called upon Mr. George Norwood and he gave me the following statement.
                            "I verily believe the place I showed Mr. Kregelo is where Mr. Ralston was
                            buried—I selected the place to bury the remains, helped to prepare him for burial
                            and attended the funeral. With the exception of a short time I visited the grave quite
                            often, where Ralston's remains were deposited." Signed George Norwood.</p>
                    </quote> In spite of these apparently good intentions the Council did not erect a monument, and as
                    to a memorial sketch of Ralston's life, none was printed.</p>
            <p>Five years after the removal of Ralston's remains to Crown Hill Cemetery, James Cooley
                    Fletcher, writing in one of the city papers,<hi rend="sup">18</hi> said that he had just visited
                    George Norwood who would be ninety-two years old in five months. He said that he found Mr.
                    Norwood's memory of the early years of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> vivid and accurate. Mr. Fletcher had at that time in his possession a copy of an <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> newspaper dated July, 1822, which contained an advertisement inserted by Mr. Norwood
                    who was then the city's wheelwright. Mr. Fletcher closed his article by saying
                    "Why not have a monument to Ralston? Instead of the unmeaning name given to the old
                    seminary square [University Square], which has no significance whatever, why not call it Ralston
                    Park? This would be a monumental and graceful tribute to the man who designed the plan of <placeName>

            <p>Judge E. B. Martindale, Mr. E. P. Claypool and other prominent citizens headed a movement about 1890
                    to raise funds by public subscription for the purpose of erecting a monument in honor of Alexander
                        Ralston.<hi rend="sup">19</hi> A total of three hundred fifty dollars was obtained, of which

                    than raising the money and depositing it in the Fletcher Bank came from this effort and the grave
                    remained unmarked.</p>
            <p>The obligation of the citizens to Mr. Ralston was presented again in 1904, when an article appeared
                    stating that "his grave is unmarked by any stone. There is nothing above it but the green
                    sward and yet his name is one that well deserves to be remembered in <placeName>

            <p>In 1907, Judge Martindale, mindful of the funds intrusted to him and to others during the past
                    seventeen years, attempted once more to secure for Alexander Ralston his long belated honor. The
                    local papers of November 22 and 23, 1907, carried the following information to the readers: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>A little greenish clay model of Alexander Ralston as he should have looked, according to
                            Rudolph Schwartz, the local sculptor, occupied a point of vantage on the table of the City
                            Park Board this morning. The clay man is the model of a statue which it is proposed to erect
                            in University Square, probably in the center, surmounting a fountain replacing the one that
                            now plays there all summer long.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Martindale, before the Park Board, explained that the Schwartz model was a suggestion of
                            what could be done. The <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                            </placeName> sculptor agrees to make the figure in bronze, life size, for $1,000,
                            and this, Mr. Martindale assured the board, was not more than half what a similar statue
                            would cost elsewhere. If the Park Board will decide to make up the remainder of the
                            necessary sum by giving $675 for the purpose, Mr. Martindale will turn the fund
                            now in the Fletcher Bank over to the board he said.</p>
                        <p>The matter was discussed, but no decision was reached. At Mr. Martindale's
                            suggestion the board decided to refer the subject to a committee, composed of Dr. Henry
                            Jameson and J. Clyde Power, to report probably at the next meeting.</p>
                        <p>As far as known, there is no picture or likeness of Mr. Ralston of any sort in existence, so
                            that the model made by Mr. Schwartz is, as was said, the sculptor's idea of what
                            the engineer should have looked like, if he didn't.</p>
                        <p>The little figure is clothed in an old-fashioned double-breasted, swallow-tailed <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                            </placeName> coat, with a tall hat of the period in which the engineer worked. The queer
                            costume, when compared with modern out-of-doors work clothes, led Dr. Jameson to inquire why
                            Ralston did his work in a dress suit. Mr. Martindale assured the board that the sculptor
                            made very careful inquiries as to the clothes of the period before he dressed his model.</p>
                        <p>The cost of a suitable granite base for the Schwarz statue would probably be not less than
                            $1,000, so that the cost of a fountain with this statue as a center would
                            probably be $2,500 or $3,000. Members <list type="footnotes">

            <p>On November 30, the Ralston committee of the park board reported unfavorably on the plan because of
                    the fact that the proposed statue was not a likeness. They offered the recommendation, however, that
                    the funds be held until a larger sum could be raised and then erect a fountain in University Park
                    and place a plaque on it commemorating Ralston's work.</p>

                    the passing of this opportunity gave rise to newspaper articles recalling the fact that it was once
                    intended to use the fountain site for that purpose and to the fact that much had been said and that
                    little had been done by way of honoring the designer of the "mile square."<hi rend="sup">22</hi>

            <p>The archives room of the Indiana State Library was very hot. It was midsummer of the year 1937. The
                    old newspapers of 1907 were yellow and fragile. The papers were bound and it was hard to see the
                    tops of the columns without standing up and bending over them. In a moment of relaxation certain
                    questions came to the mind of the writer: "What has become of this money raised by Mr.
                    Martindale and Mr. Claypool and others in 1890, as reported in this paper? Deposited in the Fletcher
                    Bank; but that institution has gone through reorganization several times. This fund is certainly no
                    longer in existence. But what became of it? The solicitors would not have returned it to the
                    contributors; no honor has been shown Alexander Ralston through its expenditure. If there is money
                    to be spent in his honor this is the fund to be used." The writer left the room principally
                    to get his lunch, secondly to visit the Fletcher National Bank.</p>
            <p>Arriving at the trust department the writer said, "I would like to talk to the oldest member
                    of the firm about an old trust fund left here over forty years ago." He was introduced to a
                    comparatively young man. "The newspapers show," the inquirer began, "that
                    there was deposited in this bank a sum to be used for the purpose of erecting a monument to the
                    designer of the mile square." After further explanation as <list type="footnotes">

                    he had never heard of such a trust fund, and was positive it did not exist.</p>
            <p>"Where in the bank might this money be? It is obvious that it has never been spent for the
                    purpose for which it was collected," pursued the writer. By this time the young
                    banker's interest was fully aroused and he suggested a visit to the checking accounts
                    department.</p>
            <p>Introduced to the proper official, the story of Alexander Ralston, the intention of the
                    Teachers' Federation to mark his grave, and the newspaper account of the lost fund was
                    narrated once more. "What account do you think it would be in? If you don't know
                    the name of the account, it would be like hunting a needle in a hay stack," replied the
                    official. "It should have been deposited in the name of the Alexander Ralston Memorial
                    Fund." The banker telephoned to the inactive accounts department and asked if such an
                    account existed—a long suspense, and the return call came back: "Yes we have an
                    account entitled the Alexander Ralston Monument Fund."</p>

                    tailoring. Later she married again, this time, a man with six children. After the death of her
                    second husband, she was again compelled to turn to her old occupation of tailoring. It is said that
                    in this she was an expert.</p>
            <p>Of far greater importance to the future of the little Julia, was the fact that the mother was an
                    exceptionally well-educated woman, for that time, and the author of at least one book called, <hi rend="i">Lucinda,</hi> or the <hi rend="i">Mountain Mourner.</hi> Consequently, Mrs. Cory, or
                    Mrs. Mandville, as her name was then, saw to it that her daughter received the best possible
                    education and developed in her a love of books and learning that lasted through her life. One result
                    of this was that, at what we now consider high school age, Julia Cory was teaching school, and at
                    the age of seventeen, we have a record of a poem, presumably written by her in Saratoga, <placeName>

                    remained.</p>
            <p>Beginning about 1820 and continuing most of the time for the next thirty-five years or so, Mrs.
                    Dumont taught school. One of her first schools was held in the upstairs room of the older part of
                    the house now occupied by Mr. and Mrs. J. K. Danglade. At this time, the house, not yet plastered,
                    was too cool for comfort, so Mrs. Dumont suggested to some of the older boys that if they would do
                    the work, she would procure the necessary lumber for ceiling the room. This was done and the room
                    was consequently much more comfortable. Among the pupils who helped was "Uncle"
                    Aime Morerod, still remembered in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>. At another time, she taught in a building on the lot where the present James Sieglitz
                    residence stands. Ferret Dufour, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Switzerland</region>
                    </placeName> County's historian, was also an early pupil of hers.</p>
            <p>Tradition has it that Mrs. Dumont, in her earlier days of teaching, often had her baby in its cradle
                    in one corner of the room so that she could watch the child while pursuing her pedagogical duties.
                    At the same time, it was not unusual for her to have, besides the baby, a primer class in one corner
                    and an advanced algebra or geomtery class in another corner, keeping a very competent eye on all
                    three. This was the more remarkable when we remember that at the time she began teaching, it was
                    indeed out of the ordinary for any woman to be proficient in any branch of higher mathematics. Many
                    women in that day, having received an education equivalent to that of finishing the fourth grade,
                    were considered well educated.</p>
            <p>In that earlier period, the usual accompaniments of teaching were the free use of the rod, the dunce
                    cap, and allied devices. The teacher, usually a man, would sometimes wear out five or six stout
                    switches in the course of a daily session, punishments being swift and sure for the most trivial
                    offences. For a really serious offence, a delinquent was often given a beating severe enough to tear
                    his shirt and <pb n="300" id="VAA4025-034-3-042"/> stain it with blood. As for giving the pupil any
                    commendation for work well performed, the very suggestion was too ridiculous to be considered.</p>
            <p>However, Mrs. Dumont did not agree with this viewpoint and gave praise where it was earned. Of this,
                    in <hi rend="i">The First of the Hoosiers,</hi> George Carry Eggleston says that Julia L. Dumont was
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>the wisest woman, and the most successful teacher I have ever known. … I have
                            called her a Dr. Arnold in petticoats, but she was more even than that. Her gift of mastery
                            over young minds was an inspiration, her sympathy with youthful thought and feeling was a
                            sixth sense. Indeed her gift and her practice of encouraging pupils was looked upon by many
                            parents at that time as dangerous in tendency. To those who had been trained in the
                            severities of an older and ruder time, praise for a pupil seemed a perilous throwing down of
                            the bars of discipline. It was feared also that commendation might breed vanity and
                            self-conceit of a kind to endanger the salvation of souls.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

                            forgotten but in the time, before railways, when the west, shut in by the Alleghanies, had
                            an incipient literature, Mrs. Dumont occupied no mean place as a writer of poetry and prose

                        <p>We thought Mrs. Dumont's poem on "The Retreat of the Ten Thousand"
                            admirable, but we were partial judges. Her story of "Boonesborough" was
                            highly praised by the great lights of the time. But her book of stories is out of print, and
                            her poems are forgotten. …</p>
                        <p>But as a schoolmistress, Mrs. Dumont deserves immortality. She knew nothing of systems, but
                            she went unerringly to the goal by pure force of native genius. In all her earlier life she
                            taught because she was poor, but after her husband's increasing property relieved
                            her from necessity, she still taught from love of it. When she was past sixty years old, a
                            school room was built for her alongside her residence, which was one of the best in the
                            town. It was here that I first knew her after she had already taught two generations in the
                            place. The "graded" schools had been newly introduced and no man was found
                            who could either in requirements or ability, take precedence of the venerable
                            schoolmistress; so the high school was given to her.</p>

                            in our pursuit of knowledge, so that the school hours were not enough, and we had a
                            "lyceum" in the evening for reading compositions and a club for the study
                            of history. If a recitation became very interesting, the entire school would sometimes be
                            drawn into the discussion of the subject; all other lessons went to the wall, books of
                            reference were brought out of her library, hours were consumed and many a time the school
                            session was prolonged until darkness forced us reluctantly to adjourn.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

            <p>These lyceum sessions were so interesting to the participants that little or no notice was taken of
                    the time consumed. Two of the girls who attended these lyceums boarded at the home of Mrs. Lucy
                    Detraz. One winter evening, "Aunt Lucy," who always sat up until they came home,
                    waited for them and as their usual hour came and passed, she waited uneasily for their appearance.
                    Ten o'clock, eleven and still the clock ticked on to midnight and no girls. After it struck
                    twelve, "Aunt Lucy" very indignantly put on her wraps, lighted a lantern and
                    started for Mrs. Dumont's. Arriving there, she found the lyceum session going full blast.
                    Interested in what they were doing, both teacher and pupils had entirely forgotten time until they
                    heard "Aunt Lucy's" indignant exclamation: "Julia Dumont, you
                    ought to be ashamed of yourself for keeping these children here till such an hour!"</p>
            <p>Mrs. Dumont's library was by far the most complete of any in the community and she was
                    thoroughly familiar with the volumes included, among which were Shakespeare's plays, the
                        <hi rend="i">Encyclopedia Britannica,</hi> and books on philosophy and poetry, as well as those
                    which related to the general school subjects which she taught. This wide variety of reading matter
                    was at the disposal of and used by the entire town.</p>
            <p>Edward Eggleston further said of Mrs. Dumont in his article on western teachers: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Mrs. Dumont was the ideal of a teacher because she succeeded in forming character. She gave

                            diligence, a bright pupil for ability, a good one for general excellence. The dullards got
                            more than their share, for, knowing how easily such a one is disheartened, Mrs. Dumont went
                            out of her way to praise the first show of success in a slow scholar. She treated no two

            <p>George Cary Eggleston tells how Mrs. Dumont taught him to write legibly after all his previous
                    teachers had failed to teach him even the rudiments of writing. These teachers included in addition
                    to the ordinary school instructor, several special writing masters. But he himself says that the
                    result of all their efforts was nil, and that he could not read the manuscript when it was cold. He
                    reports that his latest teacher had <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>made a positively desperate attempt to teach me to write. He had tied up my fingers with blue
                            ribbons to compel me to hold my pen correctly. He had written "miserable"
                            across each page of my copybook—emphasizing his criticism with even more
                            elaborate flourishes than usual. He had called me "dunce,"
                            "booby," and other pet names of like sort, and finally he had dismissed me
                            from his school, sending my mother a letter in which he assured her that it was useless to
                            make any further effort to teach me an art which I was wholly incapable of learning.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>

            </p>
            <p>After this, George asked Mrs. Dumont to excuse him from all writing exercises and upon her surprised
                    inquiry as to whether he had learned to write so well that he couldn't learn any more, the
                    shame-faced boy confessed that his teacher had found him incapable of learning to write. Mrs. Dumont
                    drew the story of his experiences from him and she promised to teach him to write a clear and
                    legible hand so that in two weeks he could write a letter to this writing master at her dictation
                    and thus show the man that his estimate of the boy's capabilities was far from correct.
                    Buoyed by her faith in him, he made up his mind he would learn to write under her direction, though
                    he had to give up all his days and nights to succeed. He was determined, even though it should
                    involve physical torture, to justify this faith in him by becoming a good scribe. Unconventionally,
                    she explained that flourishes were unnecessary, that a difference in width of stroking was not
                    needed but legibility was, and that the method of holding the pen was not as important as whether or
                    not it was comfortable and natural to the user. To George's astonishment, he could read
                    what he had written after the very first session, and, at the end <list type="footnotes">

            <p>A contributor to the success was her husband, himself a well-educated man, a fine lawyer, and always
                    an advocate and active promoter of higher education. He filled several local offices, such as
                    Justice of the Peace and Coroner, and, as early as October, 1814, served as inspector at the
                    election dividing the county into townships. He was also president of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> County's first representative in the legislature. The trip to the capital,
                    then located at Corydon, had to be made on horseback with his necessary baggage carried in
                    saddlebags. He also served as a representative in five additional, though not always consecutive,
                    annual sesions, and in the state senate continuously from 1831 to 1837. After his last term in the
                    senate, he ran for Governor but was defeated. This was in the great internal improvements contest of
                        1837.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> His opponent was David Wallace, who stood for the whole program of
                    public works adopted in 1836, while Dumont advocated a modification. Much of his work in the
                    legislature was associated with the fight for a better educational system, and he was instrumental
                    in helping to establish early in Indiana's history a high standard for the public education
                    of her children.</p>
            <p>John Dumont prospered and he acquired quite a little real estate around the town. He started and
                    maintained for many years a nursery of fruit trees, raising and selling several varieties of apple
                    trees, some of, the varieties that he sold still being found in present day nursery catalogues. He
                    was quite successful in his profession as a lawyer, having been admitted to the Indiana bar in 1818
                    at the March session <list type="footnotes">

            <p>In an article in an old Reveille, we find the following description of John Dumont in his later
                    years: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>He was dressed in a faded suit of butternut jeans with a cap to match, and trousers stuffed
                            into soggy boots. The suit might have been made by his wife [dead for a few years] who was a
                            noble teacher, but a flop as a tailoress [if she really made them]. … John Dumont
                            was "a helluva looking lawyer" but he was smart enough that looks

            <p>In another article in the <hi rend="i">Reveille</hi> concerning early courts and lawyers, we find a
                    description of the veteran attorney in action. At the time referred to he was in his seventies and
                    more than somewhat frail, but according to the writer was "able to take care of his end of
                    the case and occasionally amused the spectators with wise-cracks, but his voice was not
                    strong." The opposition attorney in this particular case was a much younger man, but he
                    didn't seem able to down the veteran as Mr. Dumont more than held his own in the many wordy
                    clashes during the progress of the case. When the trial stopped for dinner, the young reporter of
                    the proceedings says he was quite surprised to hear Mr. Dumont quickly accept the invitation of his
                    opponent to have dinner with him. At the age of seventy-four, in 1861, he served as judge <hi rend="i">pro tem</hi> in the absence of the regular judge of the <placeName>

                    story was probably one of her earlier published efforts and held it to be superior to much material
                    published in the magazines of the year 1869.</p>
            <p>Meredith Nicholson says: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Mrs. Dumont was the first Hoosier to become known beyond the state through imaginative
                            writing. In the little school of story tellers and poets that flourished in the
                                <geogName>Ohio Valley</geogName> in its early history, she was one of the chief figures.
                            It had not then become the fashion to local life and her prose sketches usually reflected

                            skill was superior to that of her western contemporaries; but it is idle and ungracious to
                            criticize the writings of one whose talents were so varied, and whose life was consecrated

            <p>The book referred to was Mrs. Dumont's last published work and is a series of short stories.
                    In her preface she says that the book was long planned, but delayed of execution as other duties
                    intervened. She dedicated it to her two living sons, the only two remaining of the seven sons she
                    had borne. Written in the fifties, the stories are, as might be expected, very moral in tone and
                    expressed in flowery language. The heroes are knights in shining armor, or rather their nineteenth
                    century equivalents, and the heroines are the proverbially delicate and shrinking damsels of
                    romance. Stripped of some of their excess verbiage, the tales might be interesting even now, but
                    written as they are, no one in the busy world of today is likely to take the time to find out.</p>
            <p>The Dumonts owned property where the county infirmary now is. There they always lived, building their
                    first home on that site. It was the Hon. John Dumont, who, when he became more prosperous, built the
                    original house that is now used as the principal building by the infirmary. The stone addition at
                    the back of the house was built by him as a surprise for his wife, when, in the summer of 1856, she
                    made a trip to <placeName>

                    and Harriet was a very brilliant affair. The story is told that the bride's dress was of
                    heavy, white satin elaborately embroidered with pearls and almost stiff enough to stand alone.

                    death claimed him at the age of twenty-six. This was only a year after his marriage, and his wife

                    delegations called upon him at his home. These were from surrounding
                            towns—<placeName>

                    day came in the early evening when a voluntary throng of more than 5,000 of his <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> neighbors and friends gathered around his home with joyful demonstrations. Addressing
                    them from his doorstep with deep feeling, he said in part: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>His concluding words were: "My house will always open its doors gladly to any one of you

            <p>Benjamin Harrison was a typical citizen of the Hoosier capital and wished always to be known as such.
                    It was his chosen home. He came to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> with his young wife, Caroline Scott Harrison, in 1854, to begin the practice of law at
                    the age of twenty-one. The young couple began their residence in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> in a humble three-room cottage, rented for six dollars a month. As the family increased
                    and the young lawyer's business prospered, they moved twice, each time into a somewhat
                    larger home. In 1871, already a leader in his profession, Mr. Harrison built the stately but modest
                    mansion, now become a memorial. In 1896, he was married to Mary Lord Dimmick, and his last years in
                    his home were gladdened by his association with her and by the childish affection of their little
                    daughter Elizabeth.</p>

                    a fine American family. Even families of states are involved in this singular continuity. <placeName>

                    that Benjamin Harrison ever sought or desired even in the smallest degree any personal advantages
                    from his illustrious family heritage. Indeed, the evidence is all to the contrary. He seldom
                    mentioned his family and when he did, it was with exemplary modesty. An example of this is seen in
                    his speech at <placeName>

                    leaders in that growing age of the Old Dominion. Greatest of all was the fifth Benjamin,
                    great-grandfather of our own Benjamin Harrison, for he was a member of the Continental Congress and

                    his children were born there; among them, his son John Scott Harrison, who became the father of
                    Benjamin Harrison of Indiana and the nation.</p>
            <p>There is still to be seen, in the old shutter on a south window of the living room in that old
                    mansion, the bullet hole, supposedly made by an Indian firing from the darkness of the walnut grove
                    surrounding the mansion. That bullet narrowly missed the head of an infant Harrison, whom his
                    father, the Governor, was carrying before the fireplace. That infant was John Scott Harrison, who
                    lived to become the only American destined to be the son of one president and the father of another.</p>

                    of that dramatic campaign made a lasting impression upon Benjamin. Following the death of General
                    Harrison in 1841, after one month in the White House, his widow came to make her home for the rest
                    of her life with her son, John Scott Harrison, while the boy Benjamin was growing to manhood. Though

                    from here, he was elected President in 1888. Sixty years, 1773 to 1833, divided the birthdays of his
                    illustrious grandfather and himself. Forty-eight years, 1841 to 1889, separated their inauguration

                            he had won from his fellow-citizens. It seems to be the settled habit in our family to leave

            <p>This has the true Harrison tone and the genuine American ring. He must have received fine inspiration
                    from his distinguished family heritage; but the name of Harrison could no more make him the gallant
                    soldier and famous statesman that he was than make him a brilliant and successful lawyer.
                    Notwithstanding the many interruptions due to public service, he became the acknowledged head of the

            <p>Throughout the summer and autumn of 1888, General Harrison received at his home from one to five or
                    more different delegations daily. They represented all classes and occupations from all parts of
                    Indiana and there were many from neighboring states. To each of them he extended a special greeting
                    peculiarly suited to the given group and the place it represented, showing his versatility and his

                    West-from April 14 to May 15 in 1891, was a demonstration of his adaptability. In this tour of
                    10,000 miles through twenty-two states all of his more than one hundred fifty speeches were happily

            <p>The speeches of Benjamin Harrison would serve as excellent specimens for study and drill by students
                    in our schools to-day, and they offer the best source material for historic site recitals at his
                    home. A Pageant-Drama of Harrison Historical Episodes was given at the memorial home by the Society
                    of Indiana Pioneers on May 21, 1938. A series of pilgrimage programs is being conducted to the home
                    under the sponsorship of the Indiana University Foundation for the purpose of demonstrating the
                    value of such recitals. The spacious rooms, stately portico and shady lawn furnish rare facilities

            <p>The Benjamin Harrison home has been fully restored and is equipped throughout with furnishings that
                    belong to the Victorian, or "Gay Nineties", period. Many of these furnishings were

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, a number of gifts have been received for which the Society is deeply grateful. The
                    amount Of material received as gifts, however, has been somewhat disappointing. The Society has a
                    relatively small income for <pb n="320" id="VAA4025-034-3-062"/> an important historical library. It
                    is not attempting to develop a general nor a numerically large library; being in the same building
                    with the State Library, it rather seeks to avoid duplication. Its chief function is to develop a
                    collection of rare and valuable historical material, especially upon the region of the Old
                    Northwest. Much of this material is scattered in homes of families that have been longest in this
                    region. Undoubtedly much of it is known to, or can be located by, members of the Society. May we
                    urge all of our members to look for historical material of this sort, both books and manuscripts,
                    including letters, in their own attics, and to be on the lookout for it among their neighbors and
                    friends. Gifts of this material are greatly appreciated by the Society and are a valuable
                    contribution towards preserving our history. If it cannot be given or purchased at the time,
                    provisions for bequests not only are in order but frequently are a source of satisfaction to the
                    present owners.</p>
            <p>An interesting, and thus far a unique, provision has been made in the will of a well-known Indiana
                    citizen. This person is compiling a historical publication and has taken care of the contingency of
                    dying before it is completed by making a bequest for the completion and publication by the Indiana
                    Historical Society, Many of our readers can recall cases in which this was not done and consequently
                    important work was lost. The Society, of course, cannot obligate itself to accept bequests for the
                    publication of all such works, but a reasonable assurance could be given by previous consultation,
                    or other provision could be inserted into the will should the Society not accept the bequest.</p>
            <p>Both the committee on covered timber bridges and the committee on early mills have been steadily at
                    work. Much information and many illustrations remain to be collected or definitely given up as
                    unobtainable. However, the committees have gone far enough to begin to plan for final compilation
                    and writing. The committee on publication hopes that in both cases an attractive volume can be
                    produced. No time can be set, but the committees are working toward the completion of their work for
                    publication within the next two or three years.</p>
            <p>The membership of the Society has reached an all-time <pb n="321" id="VAA4025-034-3-063"/> high. For
                    some years prior to 1925, memberships ran for one year from the date of the payment of the annual
                    dues and no exact figures are available for any one time. It seems certain, however, that the
                    present total membrship of 1241 (exclusive of honorary) is the largest in the one hundred eight
                    years of the Society's history.</p>

            <p>The high school teachers of history are on the firing line. Often, being engaged in their work of
                    teaching the events of the past and present, they become absorbed in the processes of imparting
                    these facts, and in those whom they are instructing. Little details come and go in their daily
                    routine which seem insignificant. Like the soldier on the firing line, little bits of information
                    which they come in contact with seem so insignificant that opportunities are passed. Yet the men
                    back of the lines need this information, and the good soldier en the firing line today not only
                    fights but becomes a collector of bits of information to be passed back to others with more time,
                    experience, and broader views to look them over and to discover their real significance and put them
                    to use in their proper places. So the history teachers in our Indiana High Schools are on
                    history's firing line. They should be constantly looking for bits of rare information, as
                    well as for facts which seemingly are insignificant but may become very important in a broader
                    set-up.</p>
            <p>As an illustration the writer will relate the story of two letters which came to his attention when
                    he was a history teacher. Several years ago, after teaching a lesson in <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> History, a boy stopped after class and said he had a letter at home that he would like
                    for me to read. The next day before school started the letter was brought in and read. It was a
                    description by an eye witness of Morgan's Raid in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> after Morgan had left Indiana soil.</p>
            <p>A year or so later a girl informed me that her mother had discovered an old letter in a clock. I
                    asked to see it. This letter was written by a missionary to the Wyandotte Indians here in Indiana.
                    The letter described the writer's trials with the Indians as they were moved from Indiana
                    to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>. A copy of this was sent to the Secretary of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> Historical Society, and it brought a reply that this was a letter of real importance.
                    Also that the Secretary was writing a biography of Mr. Wheeler and welcomed this find. Incidentally,
                    the girl's parents discovered relatives in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> and visits have been exchanged since that time.</p>
            <pb n="323" id="VAA4025-034-3-065"/>
            <p>Perhaps there are other teachers of history in Indiana with better stories than the above. Let us
                    hope so. I am also satisfied that there are others that have passed up "finds"
                    when the gold ore was in their pans. The <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> contains a
                    department devoted to the publishing of documents. It can serve us and we can serve it. There should
                    be a better tie-up between history teachers of Indiana and the Indiana Historical Society. This
                    sentiment was expressed by a speaker at the October meeting.</p>
            <p>As we travel "The trodden path" recognizing all of the old land marks, perhaps we
                    should saunter a little and look more closely. A "find" may be just back of that
                    "big decaying walnut stump." So come on History Teachers of Indiana, "let
                    down the `bars'—climb over" and let us use the work of the Indiana
                    Historical Society and of the quarterly, the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History.</hi>

            <p>Letters and diaries are often of more interest for the light they throw upon a way of life or a point
                    of view than for their descriptions of great events. Such, to a degree, is the case with the letters
                    of a drummer-boy that follow. His regiment, although almost constantly in active service, aside from
                    the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vicksburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> campaign, took part in few of the important battles of the Civil War. There are casual
                    accounts here of a number, of forgotten skirmishes and expeditions, and something about the assault
                    on Fort Blakely during the siege of Mobile, but some readers will perhaps get more of an idea,of a
                    Civil War soldier's life from incidental things: from the chicken that spoiled in the
                    haversack, so that "I did not get to eat a bit of it;" from the green corn that
                    was "coming out in tassell in some places and looks very nice," but was used to
                    make beds; from the picture cases that had "nearly all come to pieces," and that
                    he wanted to exchange for photographs; from the pay delayed for a year; and from Mr. Cope who
                    "comes to me everytime the mail comes and asks me if I got a letter from home and how his
                    folks is."</p>
            <p>Then, from this lad, who, in his later years, was one of the kindliest of men, comes the pious hope
                    that "Andrew Johnson will kill every leader of the Confederacy which ought to be
                    done," and the expression, "I don't know what they done with the
                    butternuts but I hope they hung them for I know they need it." No seeker after glory in
                    those days of 1864–1865, he cheered the fact that "Our regiment was so lucky as
                    to not get into the charge," and he longed for the day when "we will once more
                    have peace and hapiness restored to our once hapy [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] country." Of such
                    homely materials are most of the letters made, and so they are presented, with no omissions except
                    of some extraneous and unimportant messages to the folk at home.</p>

                    originally Colonel of the Twenty-fourth Indiana, but was now assigned to the First Brigade of the

                    Thirteenth Army Corps of Maj. Gen. John A. McClernand, one of the three army corps of Maj. Gen. U.

            <p>Immediately on landing, the Forty-seventh began the movement into the interior, marching all night,
                    and confronting the enemy under Maj. Gen. J. S. Bowen near Port Gibson on May 1.
                    "Hovey's Division had the brunt of this battle, and the 47th, assisted by a
                    battery of field guns, repulsed charges made by one of Bowen's brigades."

                    concentrating at Edward's Station. McClernand's and McPherson's corps
                    were turned in that direction. This resulted in the Forty-seventh's heaviest battle of the
                    war, that of Champion's Hill, or Baker's Creek, fought on May 16. That
                    Hovey's Division bore the brunt of this battle is shown by the casualty lists. The seven
                    divisions on the field had 2,408 casualties, of which 1,202 were in Hovey's Division.</p>
            <p>Company A of the Forty-seventh was on the skirmish line, and a short retreat of the forces engaged
                    brought the Eleventh Indiana Regiment to the rear. The charge made by this regiment swept the
                    skirmishers with it. The guns of a rebel battery were captured, but had to be abandoned, because,
                    just at that time, the Union force was outnumbered and had to fall back for a space. It was soon
                    reinforced and the enemy was driven from the field.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> Casualties in the

                                    of the enemy's forts. No enemy dare show his head. We shoot so close, or

                                    sides. A flag of truce sent out to bury the dead and bring in the wounded. The men
                                    from both sides came together and talked friendly. Our boys jollied them and advised

                    October, and then took part in Maj. Gen. N. P. Banks' first Red River Campaign, usually
                    known as the Teche Campaign. This extended from October 3 to November 30, and was marked by one
                    engagement, at Bayou Grand Coteau. It then returned to New Iberia, and while there, in December,
                    1863, the "three years of the war" having expired, the regiment re-enlisted and
                    was sent home on veterans' furlough, leaving Algiers, <placeName>

                    </placeName> on Feb. 18. The next day a public reception was given to the 146 veterans of the
                    Forty-seventh, who had re-enlisted, and to the Twenty-first Indiana, also home on furlough.
                    Addresses were made by Governor Oliver P. Morton and by Gen. Slack, who had received his commission
                    as Brigadier General of volunteers on Nov. 11, a promotion <list type="footnotes">

                    service. Incidents of the return to the front are told in the letter of April 3, 1864. The Knights
                    of the Golden Circle and other organizations of southern sympathizers were active in 1864 and it is
                    presumed they are the "Butternuts" encountered at Mattoon, <placeName>

                    remained at Shreveport until October 23. Then it was sent to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, ending its service with thirty-two officers and five hundred thirty men on its rolls.
                    Its losses had been two officers and eighty enlisted men, killed or mortally wounded and four
                    officers and two hundred fifty men, who died of disease, a total of three hundred thirty-six.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Manchester</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, and because of the fact that most of the men of the Forty-seventh had come
                    from closely continguous territory, these annual events were continued for many years. At the
                    twenty-sixth annual re-union, held at Hunting-ton in 1908, the roster was signed by 130 members.</p>
            <p>General Slack was commissioned a Brevet Major General of volunteers on March 13, 1865, "for
                    gallant and meritorious service in the field during the war". He was mustered out January
                    15, 1866, and died at <placeName>

                        <p>I seat myself this morning to try to write you a few lines to let you know that I
                                    received your letter and was glad to hear that you was well and hear that <placeName>

                                    </placeName> got home safe. I have been well for a <pb n="330" id="VAA4025-034-3-072"/> long time and as long as I keep my health I am very
                                    well satisfied. I just come from meeting. I heard the General preach<hi rend="sup">8</hi> he said he was in the hands of the rebels for six months he was taken at Pea
                                        Ridge.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> he says the prisoners was almost naked when they
                                    whre [were] exchanged, that is those that were with him.</p>
                        <p>I have been some time writing this letter. I will try and end it up in a different
                                        style.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> I will tell you something about a fight there was
                                    in town. There was a lot of soldiers come down the river on some boats this morning
                                    and the officers would not let them get off the boats and they tried to Break guard
                                    and the officers ordered the guards to shoot and one of the guards shot a soldier in
                                    the leg and then one of the privates belonging to the boat run out and cocked the
                                    pistol under the lieutenant's nose and dared him to speak and he stood
                                    there and never said a word. So then the 11th Ind. went down to settle the fuss and
                                    they soon had it stopped and there was three men shot in the operation but only one
                                        killed.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>

                        <p>It is with great pleasure that I take this opportunity to write you a letter. I am
                                    well at present and hoping that when this comes to hand may find you enjoying the
                                    same good health. I will tell you something about our travels from home.</p>
                        <p>We left <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                                    </placeName> on the 30th day of March, 1864, and got to Mattoon, Ill., on the 31st
                                    early in the morning and was called out in line of battle to fight the Butternuts
                                    but we only Captured two of them but the citizens of Mattoon was out at the same
                                    time and they caught 42 of them. So that morning we started out for Ciaro [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] about 10 o'clock but I don't know what they
                                    done with the butternuts but I hope they hung them for I know they need it. So we
                                    went gliding along on the cars and the next morning about 1 o'clock found
                                    ourselves at Cairo so we stayed in the cars till day light for it was raining very
                                    Hard and a little after day light it checked raining and we got off the cars and
                                    went on a boat named N. W. Thomas and we had just got our things on and loaded and
                                    we had to move off and go into the barracks and there we stayed till the next
                                    morning or till the afternoon rather at 1 o'clock and then we had orders to
                                    go on the boat Raymond to go to Paducah, Ky., and we started about 3
                                    o'clock and the next morning found ourselves at this place. The reason we
                                    was ordered here was that the rebels had been here and destroyed a good part of town
                                    and tried to take the place but failed and they are looking for them in again and we
                                    come here to help them out or fight them if they come in. <list type="footnotes">

            <p>[The stay in Paducah was not long, and the Forty-seventh soon joined Gen. Bank's second Red
                    River expedition, which got under way in March, in co-operation with the navy. This is the
                    expedition referred to in the next letter. The fifteen days of fighting included Monett's

                    Graham's Plantation on May 5. The "ten days' hard marching"
                    refers to the retreat to Morganza, which was reached on May 20 after an engagement at Mansura May
                    16. Apparently the drum major never did come back, as Henry L. Bert became drum major or
                    "principal musician" of the regiment during his second enlistment and was
                    discharged as of that grade.]</p>

                                    hard expedition of marching and fighting. We was skirmishing about 15 days all
                                    together and then after that 10 days hard marching, day and night both and very
                                    scarce of rations but it is all over now We are in camp close to the
                                        <geogName>Mississippi River</geogName>. It has been just one week since we come
                                    here and we moved camp today. We was about a quarter of a mile from the river and
                                    today [Sunday] we moved down close to the river so we would be handy to watter. I
                                    went out this forenoon to get some brush to make a shade for my mess and it was
                                    about a mile to the woods where we went to get brush and it was very tiresome work
                                    and when we come back we got our dinners and then went out to get some green corn to
                                    make beds, we dont mind that in this country. We just use it the same as we do
                                    anything else for anything that we want it for. The weather here is very hot and
                                    dry. We have not had any rain of any account since the 23rd of April but the river
                                    has been very high but is falling now. We have fixed up Camp as if we was going to
                                    stay here some time but we dont know anything about it.</p>
                        <p>I have a great deal of work to do now for I have to attend to beating all the calls.
                                    We; have ten drummers and ten fifers and I am put at the head of them all and have
                                    to boss them all and that is what makes the work. Our drum major has never come back
                                    yet since <list type="footnotes">

                        <p>We have a table fixed up to eat off of and to write on. There is three other boys
                                    writing letters on the same table. We have a nice camp now to what we have had in

                        <p>I now seat myself to answer your interesting letter which I received a few days ago
                                    at the same time I received one from Mother and Mary and John. They was not all of
                                    one date but come the same time and I tell you I was glad to hear from home for I
                                    had not heard from there for a long time before. You wanted to know whether I had
                                    your pictures yet or not. Of course I would keep them till the last but the cases is
                                    nearly all come to pieces and if you will all get photographs for me instead of them
                                    it would be a great deal handier for me and as soon as you send me the photographs I
                                    will send the pictures and the money to pay for them, all except Eliza's
                                    and hers you cannot get it very handy for she is too small.</p>
                        <p>Now I will tell you that we are going to leave here before long. We had orders today
                                    but did not go. We had everything packed up and ready to leave at a
                                    moment's warning but after a few hours was ordered to put up our tents and
                                    we would stay a day or two longer and if we do I will write to mother and John
                                    tomorrow. There is two regiments going away today. One is the 8th Ind. and the other
                                    the 24th <placeName>

                        <p>We are now back to this miserable hole of Morganza. I would rather stay anyplace else
                                    for we cannot get anything at All. I hope we will leave before long for I want to
                                    get away from here. The very first day we got here we got orders to go the next day
                                    on a scout and that I did not like at all but had to go. We got up at 1.
                                    o'clock and started. Marched on till after daylight and then got our
                                    breakfast and then went till 10 o'clock and then had a fight which lasted
                                    till after 12. o'clock and then we slowly retreated back with the loss of 7
                                    men wounded out of the regiment. Eat our dinners between two and three
                                    o'clock and then went to camp. Got in about dark. Our whole march was about
                                    32 miles. It was an awful hard day's march being very mudy coming in for it
                                    rained all afternoon. …</p>

                    </placeName>, as is told in the letter of Nov. 19. The regiment did not, however, remain in <placeName>

                    </placeName> all winter—that was no more accurate than the prediction that they would be
                    at home by the next summer. Nevertheless, the drummer-boy was not far wrong in seeing the beginning
                    of the end in the reelection of <placeName>

                        <p>I now take this opportunity of trying to write you a few lines to inform you that I
                                    am still a little farther out in <placeName>

                                    </placeName> where we have been for about three Days and I expect we will stay here
                                    till winter. When we came here we was as wet as we could be for when we got off the
                                    cars it was about nine o'clock and it looked about as much like rain as I
                                    ever saw it but it did not rain till about 1. o'clock and then it commenced
                                    raining and we was out dores [doors], had not a tent nor a house to crawl into but
                                    had to take it till about 10 o'clock the next day and then we got into some
                                    houses which some other soldiers had built and had left a few days ago and gone to
                                    fort Smith but they had left some of their sick here and they are here in the camp
                                    with us but we dont know whether we will stay in these houses all winter or not or
                                    whether we will have to go out when these other soldiers come back. There is some
                                    talk of them going some other place when they come back and if they do we will have
                                    the quarters all to ourselves but if they dont we will have to build some of our
                                    own.</p>
                        <p>Well I was speaking of the rain when we first came here and that rain is not over
                                    yet. It is still raining and has been ever since we came here. We have not seen the
                                    sun since we came here but for all the rain it does not get muddy here like it does
                                    in some places for it is very hilly and the hills is very gravely.</p>
                        <p>This is a very nice place about as nice a place as <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Noblesville</settlement>
                                    </placeName> only <pb n="335" id="VAA4025-034-3-077"/> a great deal larger but
                                    nothing to compare with the capital of Indiana and it is very nice country around
                                    here too.</p>
                        <p>There is a great many soldiers here now and I think they will stay here all winter
                                    and; then in the Spring start out through the country after the rebels. I think that
                                    is the movements of this army but there is no telling what will be done for we have
                                    been knocked around all summer and done nothing and it may be done so this winter,
                                    but I hope we will all come home next summer and I think we will for we have won one
                                    of the grand victories already. The reason I say this is that we have got our
                                    Governor again and that is not the best yet for, we hope soon to hear of the
                                    re-election of our Noble President that we have long wished to have four years
                                    longer and when we hear of that I think we will not have to stay in the field much
                                    longer, at least I hope not.</p>

                        <p>Now I will tell you something about our camp. We are in a low place about four feet
                                    below the level of the river but there is a large leve [levee] that keeps the river
                                    in its place but the river is not always this high. It is about as high as it ever
                                    gets and when it is at its lowest stage it is about forty feet lower than it is now
                                    and it is always very muddy water and that is all the kind of water we have to drink
                                    but it is the purest water we have had to drink in this country. Our camp is
                                    perfectly dry now for it has been clear for three or four days but we have a very
                                    muddy place when it rains for it gets very muddy when it rains rite away and it is
                                    about ankle deep all over the camp. You spoke about going to school and learning so
                                    fast but I tell you when I get my money I intend to go to the city and get me some
                                    school books if I can and try to learn something too for there are a great many men
                                    in the camp that can give me lessons in all kind of school books and if I dont learn
                                    anything I will try and keep from forgetting everything I did know.</p>
                        <p>Well the weather. It is very pleasant now and has been for three or four days but
                                    Jack Frost showed himself a little this morning again but had all dried off now
                                    again and I declare I never saw pleasanter weather in my life for this time of year.</p>

                    had planned. In later life, however, he did attempt to make up for the education missed during his
                    service in the Civil War, particularly by applying himself to study of the Bible and of ancient
                    history to such a degree that he was qualified as a local preacher in the Methodist Episcopal
                    church. The Forty-seventh had been, since July, in the Nineteenth Army Corps, Department of the
                    Gulf. It was now assigned to the Reserve Corps, soon to be again numbered the Thirteenth Army Corps
                    in the new Military Division of West <placeName>

                    Maj. Gen. E. R. S. Canby, the corps by Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger. Gen. Slack commanded the First
                    Brigade to which the Forty-seventh was assigned. At times this brigade was commanded by Lt. Col.
                    McLaughlin of the Forty-seventh, and its division was the First, commanded by Brig. Gen. J. C.
                    Veatch. Spanish Fort was invested on March 26. The assault on and capture of Fort Blakely on April 9
                    is described in the letter of April 10.]</p>

                        <p>I received your letter yesterday evening which was Sunday and while I was reading it
                                    there was a tremendous artillery firing commenced which aroused my attention and I
                                    stoped reading and went up close to the skirmish line and in a few moments our men
                                    commenced yelping and I knew what was up. A charge was then going on and in about
                                    five or ten minutes more the firing ceased and another more strong and louder yell
                                    was utered and was continually kept up for more than half an hour and I rushed over
                                    with a lot more of our regiment to see! the result of the charge. There our men had

                        <p>We have been getting good news for some time about the capture of so many prisoners
                                    and old Lee and his whole army, Mobile and vicinity. Yesterday old Rebel Dick Taylor
                                    came into Mobile and surrendered up his army. Had about 5,000 men, they say. I have
                                    saw them. Yet everything has been cheering but among all the good news we received
                                    some bad news about the death of Abe <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, but at least the Rebs has not gained anything by that. I think that
                                    Andrew Johnson will kill every leader of the confederacy which ought to be done. The
                                    rebles has no army on the East side of the <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                                    </placeName> but the reble General Johnson and he has but a small force, nothing to
                                    compare with his opposition, but there is a few rebles west of the river but they
                                    can do no harm where they are. A few days ago there was a reble gunboat came out of
                                    the mouth of red river with our collors [colors] floating at half mast in honor of
                                    the president's death and all her crue [crew] on deck dressed in blue.
                                    Playing the opossum on us, run down the Miss, river almost like lightening. Went
                                    down just below the city of <placeName>

                                    Yankees but awfully mistaken. She was captured somewhere close to the mouth of the
                                    Miss, river. Didn't get away at all.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>

                                    but the paymaster is in the city sure now with plenty of money. We have almost
                                    forgotten what pay is for we have not got any for some time. Well I will close for
                                    the present. Well as usual. Write soon. Excuse this paper Anna for I have but little
                                    and must be saving till the pay comes.</p>

                        <p>We have a beautiful camp here on the top of a nice hill and the beautifulest springs
                                    here that I ever saw, more springs than can be counted and some of them the largest
                                    that I ever saw. They roll out as large as a quart cup in streams and we have got
                                    shades put up all over camp and the pretiest camp we ever had and if it would close
                                    the war by staying here I would love to stay here till the war is over.</p>
                        <p>Well, now I have given you a good description of our camp and I have nothing more of
                                    Importance to write this time. Mr. Paul and <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Benton</region>
                                    </placeName> is well and so is Mr. Cope and I would ask you and Mary to say more
                                    about Mr. Cope's folks for he comes to me everytime the mail comes and ask
                                    me if I got a letter from home and how his folks is. I always tell him or let him
                                    read the letters when you say anything about them.</p>
                        <p>So no more at present. Excuse this short letter. I will try and do better next time.
                                    Write soon as possible.</p>

                    of a projected, but unfinished, "History of our Revolutionary West in War, Diplomacy and
                    Politics." The present volume embodies some of the material in the two former publications,
                    but presents much additional material upon the struggle for the West.</p>
            <p>Under chapter headings of "Politics," "War," and
                    "Diplomacy," Dr. Bodley describes respectively the contention over western lands
                    in the Continental Congress "between states north of the Potomac and two powerful land
                    companies on one side, and the four states south of the Potomac on the other," the
                    campaigns of George Rogers Clark, and the negotiations (perhaps haggling would be a better word) by
                    the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, and chiefly by John Jay, against <placeName>
                  <country reg="sp">Spain</country>,
                            <country reg="fr">France</country>
               </placeName>, and Great Britain for title to the land
                    between the Appalachian Mountains and the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>

            <p>The land company ventures, especially the Indiana and Vandalia schemes, are drawn as shrewd,
                    unscrupulous speculations, are credited with great influence before the Revolution in <placeName>

                    </placeName> legislature and members of Congress are represented in the whole transaction as
                    conspiring against <placeName>

                    sovereign control of Congress" stressed by Herbert B. Adams, is! denied and the Adams
                    monograph, it is asserted, "fairly bristles with errors of fact and inference."</p>
            <p>In the negotiations for peace, Dr. Bodley scarcely deems worthy of mention the theory that Lord
                    Shelburne agreed to the boundary of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> and the Great Lakes as a gesture of generosity to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Rather, he interprets the English insistence upon compensation for loyalists'
                    property and other contentions as a disguise for the dominant desire of the English to keep the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> east of the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
            <p>In some respects <hi rend="i">Our First Great West</hi> reads like a polemic against land companies
                    of the revolutionary era, against states north of Virgina, against the Spanish, French and English
                    ministries, and against what might be called standard <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> historical writings. At points, the author's indictments are well founded and
                    supported by original sources. In many places, however, he overshoots the mark and gives hostile
                    interpretations based entirely on his own inferences. He is inclined to discredit everything and
                    every person not making for <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>'s possession and later the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>' possession of the West and to credit too much anything or person agreeing
                    with his own view. A curious illustration of this tendency is the emphasis upon <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s age and susceptibility to French flattery whenever he disagreed with, John
                    Jay, and the emphasis upon his wisdom and shrewdness whenever he worked with Jay.</p>
            <p>Dr. Bodley apparently has not made use of some of the important recent publications which cover part,
                    or the whole, of his subject (and which embody additional sources, such as Thomas Perkins
                    Abernethy's <hi rend="i">Western Lands and the American Revolution</hi> (1937), and the
                    monograph of Theodore C. and Marguerite Jenison Pease, <hi rend="i">George Rogers Clark and the
                        American Revolution in <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                        </placeName>
               </hi> (1929). The number of misprints is larger than it should be, though most of
                    them are not misleading (e.g., p. 130, footnote, and p. 182, in which 1794 is printed instead of
                    1784.) These criticisms, however, do not imply that the volume is not a valuable and important
                    contribution to our understanding of the movements which affected the West in the Revolution. It is
                    an incisive attack upon many traditional versions and upon some <pb n="342" id="VAA4025-034-3-084"/>
                    scholarly versions of these movements. It must be reckoned with in any attempt to reach definitive
                    conclusions. "Appendix A" makes available the; curious "Six Nation Deed
                    for Traders" (the "retribution" grant of "Indiana") of
                    November 3, 1768. The Filson Club has performed a notable service in publishing the volume.</p>

            <p>Dr. Clarence E. Carter, of the Division of Research and Publication in the Department of State, has
                    brought our Volume VI of the <hi rend="i">Territorial Papers of the <placeName>

                        </placeName>.</hi> This is the second and concluding volume of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> Territorial Papers. The papers in Volume V covered the period from the creation of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> Territory in 1798 to 1809. Volume VI, which covers the period 1809–1817,
                    treats chiefly of the administration of David Holmes who became governor in May, 1809, and served
                    until the Territory became a State in 1817.</p>
            <p>In a brief review, only a few of the many problems that troubled Governor Holmes can be mentioned.
                    Many of the papers show the slowness of travel and the uncertainty of postal service. Perhaps two
                    examples drawn from the letters of Holmes himself will suffice. In one of his first letters to
                    President <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Holmes remarked: "I left <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> for this territory early in May and arrived in Natchez on the last day of
                    June" (p. 12). In June, 1815, Holmes wrote to the President asking that he be allowed to
                    make a trip to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> in September on account of his health. The letter did not even reach <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> until two months after the date which the Governor had set to begin his journey. Within
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> Territory, which at that time included the present State of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="alu">Alabama</region>
                    </placeName>, there were many communities that had no postal service. Citizens were constantly
                    urging, through petitions to the Governor and Congress, an expansion of territorial mail facilities.</p>
            <p>If Governor Holmes had been asked to name the two problems that gave him most trouble, his
                    answer—judging <pb n="343" id="VAA4025-034-3-085"/> by the papers in the
                    volume—would have been Indians and land claims. War with the Indians, who were supported
                    by allies in Spanish <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>
                    </placeName>, disputes over ceded lands, the opening of roads and the extension of mail routes were
                    a few of the major difficulties. Many proclamations of public land sales and reports from the land
                    offices are included. Petitions frequently protested against intruders upon the Indian lands or the
                    public lands. Apparently, the usual procedure in dealing with squatters was to evict them and burn
                    their cabins. Some of the petitioners thought this treatment should be supplemented by arrest and
                    imprisonment.</p>
            <p>The book is a storehouse of information for those interested in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> territorial history, but it is more than that. Much of the material is valuable for any
                    student of American history who is interested in sources on Southern territorial history or on the
                    relations of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> with <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>, <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
               </placeName>, and Great Britain during the critical years of the War of
                    1812.</p>
            <p>As in previous volumes, the editor's work has been well done. The explanatory notes, cross
                    references, and excellent index are all very satisfactory. The inclusion of a briek sketch of the
                    political and economic background of the period would have aided the reader in placing the documents
                    in their proper prospective. Likewise, a map making clear the extent of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> Territory and the location of some of the most important land cessions, post roads, <hi rend="i">et cetera,</hi> would make many of the items mentioned more understandable.</p>

                    iron industry in America, a period when the capital involved was small, the knowledge of iron
                    manufacture meagre, and the processes employed very crude. Every chapter, and indeed every
                    paragraph, reveals that the <pb n="344" id="VAA4025-034-3-086"/> author did not write until he
                    garnered and interpreted the facts.</p>
            <p>The treatment of the "iron plantations," so widely scattered over <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, is a fascinating story. The iron-making process, the changes in the means and methods
                    of production, the ironmasters of the province who played important roles in the economic and
                    political development of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, the mansions of the masters, the work and homes of the laborers, the mines, the
                    forges, the furnaces—all these are carefully and even eloquently portrayed in the
                    narrative. The last chapter (IX) of the little volume is an excellent summary of the history of the
                    iron industry in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> from 1716 to 1800. Handicapped by lack of capital, by the money and banking situation
                    and by trade restrictions, nevertheless, "down to the period of the Revolution, the iron
                    industry of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> had achieved a normal growth." The author makes the very interesting (and no
                    doubt correct) observation that but for the high stage of development reached by iron production
                    before 1775, "the colonists would have been helpless in the struggle" for
                    independence.</p>
            <p>An extensive and very valuable bibliography accompanies the little volume and the index is adequate.
                    The author deserves high praise for his careful research and careful writing. He has prepared a
                    volume that will prove to be very useful to teachers and students of economic history, not only in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, but elsewhere, especially in every state where iron production was carried on in the
                    eighteenth century. The book will also provide fascinating reading for any intelligent person who
                    may pick it up.</p>

            <p>Every general work on American history, short or long, has given some attention to political

                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>. Comments in such works have usually been based on limited information, and it is well
                    that a monograph dealing with the topic has at last appeared. The volume covers roughly the half
                    century following 1773, with the quarter century lying between 1790 and 1815 strongly <pb n="345" id="VAA4025-034-3-087"/> stressed. A trained student, working on such a fascinating period of <placeName>

                    </placeName> history with quite adequate sources at his command, could not fail to produce a worth
                    while volume.</p>
            <p>It was in the era of the Whisky Insurrection that the Federalist and Republican parties were
                    gradually forming behind <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Jefferson. It was a period of much confusion when some of the great actors on the
                    stage did not understand the situation. Hamiltonians made a great deal of the overawing of the
                    insurrectionists of western <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> by the army that marched across that state, and historians have since pretty generally

                    At least they have credited them with carrying the federal government through the first dangerous
                    threat to its newly created national power. The statement of the author that the insurrection,
                    viewed in relation to the nation, "represented the first definite challenge to the
                    sovereignty of the federal government" seems too strong. The assertion in the remainder of
                    his sentence that "it also presented a definite challenge to the Federalist party"
                    (p. 120) accords more fully with the facts, in the opinion of the reviewer. Indeed the first
                    contention appears to be largely discredited by the matter presented in the remainder of the chapter
                    (pp. 129–131).</p>
            <p>The relationship of the Democratic Societies to the rebellion against the excise tax is briefly
                    treated (p. 125). Inasmuch as President <placeName>

                    </placeName> placed much of the responsibility for the insurrection on these clubs, it would have

                    as interchangeable, but even there it is best to qualify the use of the latter two. The country-wide
                    party name for Jefferson's party was Republican, and to use either of the other names with
                    the same application too early is confusing.</p>

            <p>This very welcome volume not only reproduces the early writings of Turner but includes a list of all
                    of his writings and an essay on "Turner's Formative Period" by Fulmer

                    brief comments on the contents of the volume.</p>
            <p>The reprinted essays include: "The Significance of History" (1891);

                    famous essay ever written in the field of American history, was republished here in order to provide
                    a new copy of the essay in the form in which it was published by the American Historical Society,

                    this essay, there is a comparison of the several versions in the Appendix (pp. 275–292).</p>

                    efforts were spared to make the "Bibliography" complete. It is accompanied by a

            <p>The essay by Fulmer Mood, "Turner's Formative Period" (pp.

                    the beginnings of Turner's teaching at <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> in association with William F. Allen is charmingly told. The gradual development of the
                    ideas embodied in "The Significance of the Frontier in American History" is
                    skilfully traced, and attention is drawn to the nature of his new course, first offered in
                    1891–1892, that was to become the famous course, "The History of the
                    West," beginning at <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Perhaps the only fault to be found with the account of Turner's early period
                    is that it is too brief in relation to his work as a young university teacher, and, especially, in
                    regard to his training at Johns Hopkins University. One must remember, of course, that the object of
                    the volume is to provide a reprinting of the early writings and be thankful that the other good
                    features were added.</p>

                    the patience to go over the conveyances, <pb n="349" id="VAA4025-034-3-091"/> inventories, and
                    records of purchases and sales, can learn much. As the author suggests (p.
                    7)—"Probably in no other type of plantation record can the scholar find such a
                    variety of information on the prices of commodities and services." Even general readers
                    will grievously err if they give this volume but a passing notice because so large a portion of it
                    is devoted to documents. It is a valuable, interesting book that can be highly recommended to both
                    libraries and individuals.</p>

                    "Preface" by Mr. Kagan. Great care has been exercised in the preparation of this
                    volume of the "Inventory of the County Archives of Indiana", and the State

            <p>In his article, "Recollection of Morgan's Raid," published in the June
                    issue, Mr. Middleton Robertson commented on the losses of farmers by reason of horses being
                    appropriated <pb n="350" id="VAA4025-034-3-092"/> by Confederates. The soldiers left behind worn out
                    horses which farmers made use of after caring for them until they were fit for work. Then these
                    horses that had been discarded were collected by agents of the Federal Government. Farmers later
                    made a concerted effort to obtain compensation for the animals appropriated by Morgan's
                    men, but according to Mr. Robertson the "claims were never allowed." Judge Lewis
                    B. Ewbank of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

                    Indiana Historical Society <hi rend="i">Publications</hi> (VII, 131–183) in which he
                    furnished information relative to the settlement of most of the claims. In his account (p. 182),
                    Judge Ewbank wrote: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            forage to their pursuers, waited several years for compensation for their losses. At length
                            in 1867, under a resolution of the General Assembly [of Indiana] a commission was appointed
                            to pass on the claims, amounting to nearly half a million dollars. The State finally allowed
                            and paid claims amounting to $413,599.48, of which more than $85,000

            <p>After his attention was called to the above statement, Mr. Robertson, who lives at Deputy, Indiana,
                    declared that he never heard of any such settlement, and added: <quote rend="blockquote">

                    I was a year beyond forty. I do not believe that one must live two score years before life can
                    begin, nor do I believe that all great ideas generate in the minds of young men. Whatever the truth
                    about this last contention, it is a poor philosophy to accept in a world where men are neither shot
                    at forty nor electrocuted at sixty. Since many of us live and work beyond sixty, it is better that
                    we continue to use our faculties throughout life than to surrender all expectations of productive
                    work and thinking at forty, or sixty either, because of an unproved theory.</p>
            <p>The academic year began on Wednesday, September 28, in 1911. When the day came, my wife, our small
                    daughter and myself, having been installed in a modest apartment at No. 47 Langdon Street for a few
                    days, I was ready for my year of study. I had already conferred with Dean Charles H. Haskins and Dr.
                    Frederick J. Turner, after an earlier meeting with Secretary George W. Robinson. The last named
                    gentlemen, who wore a full beard (not a <placeName>

                    mildest, kindest man that it has ever been my lot to meet. I had occasion to go to his office
                    several times while at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and he was always the same. I never saw him hurried or impatient, and can well believe
                    that throughout his career as Secretary of the Graduate School, he met and handled students just as
                    he did me and that he spoke every word slowly and with a gentle inflection.</p>
            <p>For twenty years, I had felt an urge to spend some time at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>

                    that every graduate student should be carefully guided and frankly advised, but I feel that each one

                    these humble statistics, but I am certain of their accuracy. I kept a careful cash account and have

                    Like Paul of old, I was able to prove that I knew how to "abound", but I trust
                    that no taxpayer will become unduly excited as my salary was just $230 per month or
                    $2760 for four quarters of service after both adjustments. While at <placeName>

                    but the president wrote me that the school could not pay so much, and I returned to my job in <placeName>

            <p>During my year as acting-head of the department of American history, I was in a more conspicuous
                    position than I had ever been before. My contacts with President Parsons and heads of other
                    departments were more frequent, my responsibilities were greater, and new duties outside of my
                    department were assigned to me. My method was "to saw wood" quietly and let
                    matters take their course. The head of the department was on leave and there was a general belief
                    that he was being eased out in the most kindly manner. One does not like to be placed in such a
                    position, but I was certain that I had been loyal to my superior, and, since it was out of the
                    question to aid him in any way, I gave very little thought to what was said or to the possible
                    outcome. Not once did President Parsons mention his plans for the future of the department to me
                    until after the whole matter was settled.</p>
            <p>For many years teachers' institutes were held in the counties of Indiana, and likewise in
                    many other states, each lasting for one week. Two or more lecturers were employed by each county
                    superintendent, each lecturer giving two addresses per day, as a rule. A number of counties paid
                    well and Indiana became a sort of Mecca for "instructors" from every part of the
                    country. Scores of informational or inspirational lectures were annually delivered to the teachers
                    of the public schools, but a considerable number of the educators and others who picked up some
                    money on the side during August or September by serving county institutes were little more than
                    entertainers. Spellbinders who more or less cleverly purveyed second-hand pedagogy were among those
                    employed each year to uplift the Hoosier teaching fraternity. <pb n="359" id="VAA4025-034-3-101"/> I
                    did not make a practice of serving county institutes, but lectured in enough to know what the system
                    was like and to become acquainted with its good and bad features.</p>
            <p>Early in September of 1913, I lectured for a week before the teachers of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pike</settlement>
                    </placeName> County, Indiana, in institute assembled.<hi rend="sup">12</hi> This was one of the
                    spots in Hoosierdom where men remained in the teaching profession, and I was very agreeably
                    surprised at their genuine interest in history and politics. This was partly due to the fact that
                    the condition of unrest which produced the Progressive party in 1912 had by no means subsided. So
                    great was the interest in political questions and the party situation that I was obliged to meet
                    with an enthusiastic group after the hour of adjournment in the afternoon for an off the record
                    discussion of politics in which everyone took part. One of the teachers in this group, who was then

                    Theodore Roosevelt would bolt the party should the delegates fail to nominate him became one of deep
                    moment. I have very seldom bothered public persons with communications, but I wrote to the Colonel
                    commending him because he had refused to declare that he would support the nominee of the Convention
                    regardless of the platform. I also called his attention to the fact that the Republican Party owed
                    its rise and early success to men <list type="footnotes">

                                    <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>, <region type="county">Fountain</region>

                            </placeName>, and Martin. I have known instructors who served in two or three counties
                            annually for many years, but I feel that I did enough work in that field. There is great
                            danger that one who does much work of the sort will dissipate his energies and fail to
                            accomplish things of greater moment. On the last day of my week's engagement in <placeName>

                            for about three weeks, passing away on September 24, 1913. Had he lived until the end of
                            December, he would have passed the seventy-third anniversary of his birth (Dec. 28, 1913)
                            and the fiftieth anniversary of his marriage (Dec. 3, 1913) to my mother, who outlived him
                            by fourteen years. My father belonged to that first generation of men born in north central
                            Indiana, a generation that never knew childhood and youth in an older area as did their
                            parents. The men and women of this generation, born on the raw frontier, were more truly the
                            products of pioneer conditions than were those who came in from more civilized states. I
                            have never known a man who was more anxious than my father that his children should make the
                            most of opportunities that had not been available to him.</item>

                    </placeName> and Seward. I do not suppose that my letter exerted a particle of influence, but when
                    the Colonel bolted and announced that he was ready to participate in the formation of a new party, I
                    was in complete accord with him.</p>
            <p>At the same time, I was deeply concerned about the-candidacy of Woodrow Wilson. Knowing well that a
                    Clark victory in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                    </placeName> Convention would make for the success of the nascent Progressive Party, I could only
                    rejoice over Bryan's great fight and the victory of Wilson. The nomination of Governor
                    Wilson caused me to write again to Colonel Roosevelt. The substance of my letter was that, since the
                    Democratic Party had not committed suicide but had instead nominated a progressive, the wisest
                    policy would be to organized the Progressive Party, make a platform and then seek a coalition with
                    the Wilson Democrats. I urged that an arrangement should be made under which, should Wilson be
                    elected, there would follow a Cabinet made up of Democrats and Progressive with a like combination
                    in the case of all important committees in Senate and House. For once, I believed that there was a
                    chance for a real and effective coalition, something to that time, and still, unknown to the
                    American party system.</p>
            <p>In reply to this earnest plea, I received a letter which explains why Colonel Roosevelt was unwilling
                    to take up my plan. I thought then and think now that, standing at the parting of the ways, he took
                    the wrong road. He made history by his decision, but he passed up the chance to make more and
                    greater history. Here is the paragraph that constituted the body of the letter: <text>

            <p>In taking this attitude, Colonel Roosevelt was in harmony with American party traditions, which only
                    means that American parties have not been wise enough to understand party coalitions and their value

                    my vote for the Roosevelt electors. I went as a delegate to the Progressive State Convention and
                    helped to nominate Albert J. Beveridge as a candidate for governor. In 1914, I again served as a
                    delegate to the party's State Convention, when Mr. Beveridge was named as a candidate for
                    the <placeName>

                  <hi rend="sup">14</hi> Ex-Senator Beveridge gladly accepted the nomination of 1912 and made
                        the race for governor with enthusiasm. Samuel M. Ralston was elected, running 109,221 ahead of
                        Beveridge. The latter, however, received 23,251 more votes than the Republican candidate,
                        Winfield T. Durbin. In 1914, Beveridge was drafted as the senatorial candidate by the
                        Progressives, and accepted very reluctantly. He knew only too well that the strength of the new
                        party was declining and that he was being asked to lead in a losing cause. He sat on the stage,
                        near the front and to the left of the chairman of the Convention. For several minutes, while the
                        delegates vigorously demanded that he accept the unanimously tendered nomination, Beveridge
                        leaned forward, his face buried in his hands, shaking his head and repeatedly saying <hi rend="i">"No."</hi> In the end, he rose to his feet, faced the silenced
                        body of delegates that filled Tomlinson Hall, and, speaking with deep feeling,
                            said—<hi rend="i">"I will."</hi> He made the sacrifice and
                        conducted a strong campaign, but wind and tide were against the Progressives. The Democrats won,
                        electing Benjamin F. Shively, with Hugh Th. Miller, the Republican candidate, running second in
                        the race for Senator.</item>
