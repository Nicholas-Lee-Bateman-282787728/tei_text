                    January 27, 1896, Mr. Clodfelter reorganized the company again, its new name being Indiana

            <p>In May, 1897, work was begun again on the grade and the power houses. The resources of the company
                    were exhausted so rapidly that very soon there was difficulty in paying the employees. June 1897,

            <p>The other pioneer in interurban railway construction in Indiana was Mr. Charles L. Henry of Anderson,
                    ex-congressman and capitalist whose efforts during the early history of the electric railway earned
                    for him the title, "Father of Interurbans". June 20, 1891, Mr. Henry bought the
                    Anderson City mule line; in April, 1892, in partnership with Philip Matter of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion</region>
                    </placeName> he built an electrically operated line from the business section of Anderson to an
                    outlying tract of land which they had recently plotted and offered for sale. In the same year the
                    mule line was electrified.</p>
            <p>In the fall of 1892, Mr. Henry went to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> and endeavored to buy certain city railway properties which he proposed to electrify
                    and extend to the neighboring towns, but was unable to effect the purchase. In 1893 he returned to
                    Indiana with the intention of building interurban lines but this purpose was also frustrated by the
                    panic of 1893. Two years later in May, lines from Anderson to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>

                    </placeName> Electric Street Railway company permitting the use of the latter's tracks. In

                    </placeName> to haul interurban cars over the city tracks. The approaching financial depression and
                    the campaign of 1896 delayed the plans again.</p>
            <p>Finally September 3, 1897, the Union Traction company ($300,000) was incorporated by

                    River</geogName> Valley grade which was a mile long and required several hundred men nearly a year
                    to complete. During November, 1907, the Electrical Installation company completed the grading and
                    was engaged in laying track. September 5, 1907, the stockholders voted to raise the capital stock to

            <p>The receiver and creditors agreed that receivers certificates to the amount of $450,000
                    were needed and would be issued to complete the line. D. M. Parry, Eli Marvin, W. E. Stevenson,
                    Eugene Bundy and Charles Hernley offered $200,000 realty and properties as security for
                    the issue of certificates.</p>
            <p>After considerable litigation the court ordered an issue of $460,000, 6%

                    following May the action was ratified by both directorates. The capital stock was
                    $8,500,000, an amount equal to the sum of the capital stock of the two companies.</p>
            <p>June 9, 1903 the Indiana Union Traction company ($5,000,000) was incorporated by Horace C.
                    Stillwell, Ellis C. Carpenter, Charles W. McGuire, Harry F. Guthrie, Edgar A. Turpin, Charles R.
                    Leas and Arthur Brady. The company, whose directors were stockholders in the old Union Traction
                    company of Indiana, operated the lines of the latter company by terms of a lease. May, 1912, the two
                    companies, by vote of their stockholderss were merged into a new Union Traction Company of Indiana
                    with a capital stock of $9,000,000. The merger was declared to be necessary in order to
                    make needed improvements.3 During the year 1912 several injunction proceedings were instituted
                    enjoining the consolidation of the two companies, the opponents of the merger invoked a clause in an
                    Indiana statute which provided that "one of the merging companies must be operating its own
                    line," but in the fall of 1915 the State Supreme court declared that the merger was legal.4</p>

            <p>All through the ages man has groped for an answer to the question: "If a man die, shall he
                    live again?" While the human race as a whole never quite believed death to be
                    the termination of human existence, faith always had to be exerted. Spiritualism has now come,
                    offering to fortify faith with knowledge.</p>
            <p>In this age of scientific investigation and enlightenment, it is imperative that we learn what
                    Spiritualism is, what it means, and what its mission. We cannot afford to neglect a subject that is
                    of such vital importance. Nor can we profit in our undertakings if we allow the doors of prejudice
                    to close the avenue of knowledge.</p>
            <p>The phenomena of Spiritualism were known to the ancient world. The literature of <placeName>
                  <country reg="ii">India</country>, <country reg="ua">Egypt</country>
               </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <country reg="cc">China</country>
                    </placeName> is permeated with spiritual truths. Mediaeval Spiritualism made its mark through Jesus,
                    the healer. This chain of spirit influence has continued unbroken; the rise and fall of nations have
                    not obliterated the phenomena from human existence.</p>
            <p>Spiritualism is defined as the belief in the continuity of life after death, and its continual
                    progress, and the application of this belief to the right conduct of living. Modern Spiritualism
                    stands for the supremacy of law in the realm of spirit, as in the physical. The departed are near
                    and communicate with their earth friends, not by permission but by law.</p>
            <p>That modern Spiritualism is not a movement of mortals alone has been frequently declared by spirit
                    workers. That the so-called dead are an organized body systematically working for mortals is no
                    secret to the mediums doing their work. Maintaining the purpose of life to be for the growth and
                    progress of the soul and its ultimate perfection, spirit teachers strive to impress this fact upon
                    man while he is yet in the body. Through the phenomena of spirit return they hope to call attention
                    to the need of individual soul culture, and to instruct man through the philosophy of Spiritualism
                    as presented through their trained speakers.</p>

            <p>The key which unlocked the door of modern Spiritualism was discovered in 1848 by the Fox sisters of
                    Hydesville, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>. Through the raps which came unheralded and unsought, to the Fox household, the girls,
                    Margaret and Kate, established a code of communication which proved that those called
                    "dead" could see and hear, and were seeking to prove their identity. That the
                    communicating intelligence had purpose, and determination to carry it out, was discovered when the
                    communication was rapped upon walls and furniture by the spirit Charles Rosna, who claimed he was
                    robbed of his peddler's pack, murdered, and his body buried in the cellar of the house.
                    These discoveries and their later verification naturally attracted widespread attention. Soon the
                    searchlight of intelligent investigation was turned upon the matter, revealing the truth that man
                    survives death, and that the fact is demonstrated through conditions operating under natural laws.
                    These revelations distinguish modern Spiritualism and place it on the list of scientific
                    discoveries.</p>
            <p>The spread of Spiritualism dates from 1850. At this early date the facts upon which Spiritualism is
                    based were known to be as follows: That man in the body is spirit as much as he ever will be; that
                    laws of the universe govern spirit; that through these laws communication between man in the body
                    and man out of the body is possible.</p>

                    Many other unorganized but zealous workers, remaining true to their convictions in the face of
                    persecution, aided the movement. Among these were Julius A. Wayland, editor of the Coming Nation, of <placeName>

            <p>There are two state Spiritualist organizations in Indiana todayâ€”one dating from 1888,
                    known as the Indiana Association of Spiritualists, the other from 1904, known as the Indiana State
                    Association of Spiritualists. The latter is an auxiliary of the National Spiritualist Association
                    which directs the welfare of the 34 state organizations and has for its purpose the promotion of
                    religion and morality, the erection of suitable places of worship where spiritualism may be taught
                    and the education and license of proper persons as authorized lecturers or teachers of Spiritualism.</p>
            <p>The Indiana Association of Spiritualists held its first Convention at Anderson, in 1888. Its by-laws
                    and laws of incorporation were drawn by Dr. G. W. Hilligoss, Anderson; James Millspaugh and Carl
                    Bronenberg, Chesterfield; and filed by A. J. Davis, recorder, of <placeName>

            <p>Of those who helped to prepare the camp ground for the first meeting in 1892, and who served

            <p>There is now a Spiritualist camp in nearly every state in the union. Camp Chesterfield ranks as the

                    </placeName>, being largest. The charming location and modern equipment make the Indiana camp an
                    ideal retreat for thousands coming from every state in the union to investigate the phenomena of
                    Spiritualism in open light through certificated mediums, and to hear its philosophy explained by the
                    highest talent in the ranks.</p>
            <p>Camp Chesterfield holds its six-weeksâ€™ session annually, beginning in July, with an
                    average attendance of twenty thousand. Its officers for 1924 are Myron H. Post, Pres.; Mable Riffle,

            <p>The rapid growth of Spiritualism is unprecedented in the annals of any religious movement. Coming
                    into an epoch of practical activity and working toward universal education and brotherhood, churches
                    began to spring up in the early fifties. The first was built in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fountain county</region>
                    </placeName>, near Veedersburg, and meetings are still held there. The builders of this church
                    suffered for their convictions by the boycott of local merchants and grain dealers, being forced to
                    take their produce to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> markets, fifty miles distant.</p>
            <p>In 1858, a church was built at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName>, by "The Friends of Progress." Its first president was Jonathan
                    Swain. Dr. Samuel Maxwell of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the first known public lecturer and message bearer, alternating with J. J. Gardner,
                    served the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName> church regularly. These workers established a Spiritualist library and lyceum in 1865.</p>
            <pb n="284" id="VAA4025-020-3-064"/>
            <p>The movement still grows. Today, Indiana with her fifty or more churches affiliated with the National
                    Spiritualist Organization, is one of over forty states so organized. The Indiana Association of
                    Spiritualists also has many churches and societies working under an independent state charter. The
                    average general attendance of all these churches and societies is now estimated at half a million.</p>
            <p>The origin and development of the First Spiritualist church of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Versailles</settlement>
                    </placeName>, is typical. Thirty years ago, Mr. B. F. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Spencer</settlement>
                    </placeName>, John B. Austin, and Dr. Jno. M. Sweezey engaged Mrs. R. S. Lilly, a medium of national
                    reputation, to deliver Spiritualist lectures in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Versailles</settlement>
                    </placeName>. After Mrs. Lilly, the national missionaries, Rev, and Mrs. E. W. Sprague, presented
                    the philosophy and phenomena to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Versailles</settlement>
                    </placeName> audiences. At Rev. Sprague's suggestion a society was organized and chartered
                    by the National Spiritualist Association under the name of "The Psychical Research
                    Society." Its membership was composed of prominent people, among whom were B. F. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Spencer</settlement>
                    </placeName> and family, Dr. Olmsted and family, Dr. John M. Sweezey and wife, and Attorney Adam
                    Stockinger and family. A course of reading for spiritual education and development was followed,
                    private home circles were formed and a medium for public message work developed. The accumulated
                    experiences of this medium were later edited by Prof. James H. Hyslop in the Journal of the American
                    Psychical Research society of 1916. In 1921 the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Versailles</settlement>
                    </placeName> society reorganized under charter of the Indiana State Association of Spiritualists and
                    the First Spiritualist church in southern Indiana was established, with Mrs. Eva M. Hunter,
                    president.</p>
            <p>The Rev. and Mrs. E. W. Sprague, working throughout Indiana thirty years ago, reported having
                    organized thirty-nine societies in the space of six months. These, like the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Versailles</settlement>
                    </placeName> society, later became churches. Also they learned that many circles for the development
                    and education of mediums were being held in private homes. That this home circle work still prevails
                    in Indiana is evidenced by the book of Mrs. May Wright Sewell which contains a wonderful example of
                    healing in the privacy of her home.</p>
            <pb n="285" id="VAA4025-020-3-065"/>
            <p>In past ages the mediaries between the spirit world and man were the seers, priests and prophets.
                    "Medium" is the word now used to designate such workers. The home circle is the
                    school where spirit teachers train mediums. While every one possesses some degree of mediumship, the
                    spirit teachers choose those certain to submit to years of training. If skeptical they become all
                    the better workers after being convinced of spirit return. In the circle, their spiritual faculties
                    are systematically quickened and exercised that they may serve as efficient tools for the receiving
                    and sending of information from the spirit world to man. In time they become message bearers and
                    speakers. They are then required by the state organizations to pass examination and become
                    certificated before engaging in public work. Those ordained as ministers are entitled to the rights
                    and privileges held by the clergy of other religions under the laws of Indiana.</p>
            <p>Many of these authorized workers were writers as well as mediums. They wrote many books which
                    contributed largely to the understanding of the subject. However, they are most popularly known and
                    loved for the messages they have delivered from the public platform. Through the public test message
                    from spirit loved ones, they brought consolation to the bereaved and proof of immortality to the
                    thousands who had disbelieved or whose faith had waned. Space permits mention of but few: Mrs. Colby

            <p>The literature of Spiritualism is abundant and has received wide attention. The books of Andrew
                    Jackson Davis circulated in Indiana in 1850. The volume, <hi rend="i">Nature's Divine
                        Revelations</hi> was noteworthy in that it contained the prophecy that Spiritualism would soon
                    become an established fact, which prophecy was fulfilled by the Fox sisters two years later. Other
                    books followed in quick succession. Most notable of these were from the pen of Robert Dale Owen,
                    member of congress and minister to Naples. Mr. Owen investigated spirit return through the Fox
                    sisters in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, and abroad with eminent men. In 1859, he made known the fact that the Spiritual
                    phenomena which had been observed for centuries were not to be dismissed by the easy term
                    "supernaturalism", but that they were occurrences under laws. The best
                    authenticated of the phenomena he published in <hi rend="i">Footfalls on the Boundary of Another
                        World.</hi> This and another book entitled <hi rend="i">

                    still find readers in Indiana.</p>
            <p>The books written in the early fifties by John W. Edmonds, judge of the supreme court of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, had even a deeper appeal than the scholarly Owen productions, because the
                    Judge's own mediumship made the subject clearer. The same is true of Rev. E. W. Sprague
                    whose books based on years of missionary experience throughout the nation convey with peculiar
                    clearness an understanding of the subject.</p>
            <p>A recent addition to the Spiritualist library is the book <hi rend="i">Neither Dead nor
                    Sleeping</hi>, by Mrs. May Wright Sewell, with introduction by Booth Tarkington. Mrs. Sewell, who
                    had attained national fame in educational lines, was ranked by <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

                    circle, especially in the work of spirit healing. Her book is a complete record of the work of
                    healing by spirit physicians through mortal coâ€”operation.</p>
            <p>The periodicals from the Spiritualist press have also a wide circulation. <hi rend="i">The
                        Progressive Thinker and The National Spiritualist</hi>, both <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> publications, are the most popular of the many Spiritualist papers circulating in
                    Indiana.</p>
            <p>To all its adherents, Spiritualism has meant intellectual emancipation. Its workers, inspired with
                    the idea that unrestricted mental progress should be for every individual, devote themselves to the
                    task of carrying the message of spirit return to the world. Through the philosophy of Spiritualism,
                    which teaches of life here and hereafter, they touch on every subject that makes for improved
                    material conditions. The organized Spiritualists of Indiana are influential in all that is for the
                    good of mankind.</p>

                            chief, he was accepted as leader over his own band merely by common consent. It is rather
                            remarkable that though not of superior physical, moral, or intellectual ability, he made

                    Stillman gave Black Hawk just provocation for retaliation by failure to observe the most ordinary
                    rules of war, seizing three Indians whom their leader had sent with a flag of truce, as the latter
                    had by this time become convinced of the futility of the war, and killing two of the five braves
                    sent to observe the outcome of the effort for peace. As could be expected, Black Hawk struck with
                    savage fury and simply overwhelmed Major Stillman and his forces, who took to their heels in an
                    ignominious flight, an act of cowardice which later conduct did not redeem. Some continued their
                    flight for forty miles to Dixon, spreading wild and terrifying reports of the ferocity and strength
                    of Black Hawk's forces.</p>
            <p>Governor Reynolds, who had, in 1831, interpreted Black Hawk's warning and threat of the use
                    of force as a declaration of war, had on April 16, 1832, sent out a call for a special levy of
                    mounted volunteers, called out the state militia, and notified the inhabitants that the Sauk and
                    Potawatomi were on the war-path.</p>

                    was rife with rumors, serious enough at best to give grave cause for anxiety, but rendered appalling
                    by the gross exaggerations with which they became embellished. News came that men had been murdered
                    on Hickory creek; that all the settlements of that section had been abandoned and that the people

                    to murder the inhabitants.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another bit of evidence of their surly mood is evidenced by C. W. Cathcart, a pioneer of <placeName>

                    </placeName>. An old chief, a giant in stature, jostled him rudely from the path, while several

                    some of the braves got switches and ordered Cathcart to whip her into submission. When he refused,
                    they turned upon him and hustled him about rudely and violently until he was able to quiet them by

                    entirely dried up, a site admirably chosen for the purpose. It was a stockade of tall posts driven
                    into the ground, the timber secured from a thick grove of wild cherry and quaking aspen just west of

                    under the hill and pick off the picket guard at night. And here a three-cornered fort was begun. The
                    ground was to be inclosed by a wall of timbers of split logs or puncheons to be sunk in the ground
                    three feet deep, rising nine or ten feet above ground in order to prevent the Indians from looking
                    over to spy out the weakness of the defense. The wall was to be pierced at intervals with
                    port-holes. The work was begun in a fever of excitement; the settlers egged each other on with the
                    wildest of tales, while, when other stories failed, some insisted on the secret hostility of the

                    preparation for this festival, which was partly penitential, partly propitiatory. One requirement
                    was that the dancers should not eat, drink, or sleep during the entire feast, which covered a period
                    of from two to four days. The first step was the erection of a structure which did duty for a temple
                    to the accompaniment of much rude ceremony, the beating of tin pans and the recital of incantations
                    by the medicine men.<hi rend="sup">35</hi> Then followed dances for many long hours by young people,

                    of their own wild songs piped through a goose-bone whistle and to the beating of deer-skin drums.
                    This was followed, in its turn, by many exhibitions by the young bucks of their powers of

                    letter seems to have been sent by an express rider first to Colonel John Jackson, presumably because
                    of the valiant part he had played in the War of 1812 under General Andrew Jackson, to the effect
                    that his Indians were near Niles, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>, and urging him to call out the militia. That officer at once set forth to summon his

                    </placeName> at eleven o'clock that same morning. One cool-headed neighbor, to whom we are
                    indebted for the preservation of the record in this part of the country, quietly made ready for a
                    campaign by half-soling his shoes while his wife prepared provisions and moulded bullets. He then
                    got out a knapsack which had already seen service in border-warfare, and started across country
                    afoot. Many of the settlers were entering <placeName>

                    rifles, old-fashioned horse pistols and butcher-knives. Men, women, and children came flocking into
                    the village hourly, crying, swearing, praying. The Indian war dances near Niles were interpreted as
                    preparation for war on that prairie.</p>

                    aroused great excitement and suspicion, allayed by the explanation that the visitors were in search
                    of seed-corn. The same pretext, offered through an interpreter, sufficed in a second Indian village,
                    where Oswego now stands, to melt the savages from hostile silence into an approach to welcome.
                    Although the report of these scouts contributed to quiet the apprehensions at <placeName>

            <p>Somewhat further south than the northernmost tier of counties of the state some ripples made
                    themselves felt. Some settlements had been made in White county, and so some alarmed families left
                    their homes when the rumors of Black Hawk's revolt reached them.<hi rend="sup">43</hi> And
                    into what later became Newton county, south of Lake county, about five hundred Kickapoo Indians came

                    hostile Indians had come nearer the Indiana border than seventy-five miles, yet the fear was
                    entirely justified, as the pioneers faced the danger of extinction. In the first place, they knew
                    quite well that the Potawatomi were closely related to the Sauk and naturally feared that they would
                    ally themselves with the latter in any movement against the whites, since they had regularly been
                    opposed to the <placeName>

                    convinced of the inability of the Indians to cope with the whites in diplomacy or in war and felt
                    that their safety depended upon the maintenance of peaceful relations with their powerful neighbors.

                    shadow of a doubt quite helpless against any band of Indians. In the second place, it was supposed

                    route of the old Sauk trail. Furthermore, a large body of Sauk warriors had crossed northern Indiana
                    just at the beginning of the war,46 and so had deepened the settlersâ€™ conviction that the
                    objective was Malden.</p>
            <p>And slight as was the visible effects of the war on Indiana, it was not without results. It led
                    immediately to the removal of the Potawatomi from this state, for, although they had kept perfectly
                    quiet, the settlers were still restive under their presence. After repeated efforts, they were
                    finally forcibly expelled in the summer of 1838 not without some accompanying hardships to the
                    natives,47 though the last lingering bands did not leave this part of the state until 1840.</p>

                        departed likewise in silence. They had called to pay their respects to a neighbor whom they
                        honored before taking their departure from the country.</item>

                    and James B. Ray were admitted to practice.</p>
            <p>At the February term, 1820, no presiding judge appears to have been present, and the associates who
                    had been on the bench from the formation of the county during the territorial government, had given
                    place to Abner Clarkson and Ralph Cotton, who appear to have been the only judges on the bench
                    during the term.</p>
            <p>Truman Richards was appointed prosecuting attorney during the term. At this term George H. Dunn was
                    admitted to practice as an attorney at law. At the May term, 1820, Miles C. Eggleston, who for so
                    many years was the presiding judge of the circuit to which <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland county</country>
                    </placeName> was attached, first appeared, took his seat as the presiding judge of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName> circuit court.</p>
            <p>What the population of the county was in 1820 it is not possible now to state, as the person
                    appointed to take the census for that year was taken sick and did not complete the same, and where
                    he had enumerated it appears that it was not very accurately done. The assessor appointed by the
                    state authorities to make an enumeration of the free white male inhabitants above the age of 21
                    years, for the year 1820, returned 1,122, which multiplied by five, the average proportion of the
                    whole to the free white males of 21 years of age and <pb n="311" id="VAA4025-020-3-091"/> upwards,
                    amounts to 5,610, so it may be safely estimated that the population of the county amounted to that
                    number.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the seat of justice, in 1820, contained upwards of 100 log, brick and frame dwelling
                    houses (the log outnumbering both brick and frame nearly two to one,) a brick courthouse, a jail, a
                    brick market house, a printing office, postoffice, an ox saw mill, two horse grist mills, a seminary
                    of learning incorporated in 1816, a circulating library, a branch of the State Bank of Indiana and
                    two Free Mason lodges.</p>
            <p>A meeting house for the Presbyterians and one for the Methodists were spoken of as being about to be
                    erected during the year 1820.</p>
            <p>The court house and school house were the only places where public religious services, such as
                    preaching and the place of holding Sabbath school, were held, until about 1828, when the
                    Presbyterians formed a church and built by subscription a meeting house on the lot where the present
                    Presbyterian church now stands. An account of the organization of the Presbyterian church and the
                    subscription for building the church, and other matters connected therewith, will be given in a
                    future number.</p>
            <p>The population of Vevay in 1820 was about six hundred souls, and the influx of population was so
                    great that many small houses contained two or three families; and in the summer of that year it
                    became very sickly, and as a natural consequence, the inhabitants being so crowded together, many
                    died of the prevailing fever, which was billious fever in a very malignant form. Many corpses, after
                    lying for a few hours, became so very yellow that many persons pronounced it "yellow
                    fever." More than one sixth of the population died during that summer and fall, and Vevay
                    after that time for many years, was shunned by persons seeking a place of settlement in the west, as
                    being a very sickly place. But the sickness that prevailed to such an alarming extent was not
                    confined to Vevay alone, but every place in the great <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> valley shared the same fate.</p>
            <p>It was several years until the prejudice against Vevay as being a sickly place was entirely removed
                    from the minds of strangers.</p>
            <pb n="312" id="VAA4025-020-3-092"/>
            <p>For many years from 1817 to 1826 farming was a very slow means of getting money together. In fact,
                    every article the farmer raised was at very low prices, and it required but a small amount of any
                    article of produce to overstock the market. As a comparison of the prices in those times with
                    present prices may be interesting to the farmers who raise produce to sell, and their wives who sell
                    butter, eggs and chickens, (not for "pin money",) but for the purpose of laying up
                    a few hundred dollars for a rainy way, some such comparison will be made: Eggs, for instance, were
                    brought to town and sold for 1 and 2Â½ cents per dozen, and sold with difficulty at that
                    price for goods in the store; now readily sell at from 10 to 15 cents a dozen in cash and
                    "no grumbling." Butter, 6Â¼ cents per pound when not more than thirty or
                    forty pounds on hand in town; now 20@40 cents cash, no matter if there is one thousand or two
                    thousand pounds in town. Chickens, from 37Â½ to 50 cents per dozen, and difficult to sell
                    them even at that price, now from $3 to $5 per dozen and no drag at that
                    price. These are the articles the farmer's wives sold to get their pins, needles,
                    pasteboards, and a little calico for sun bonnets and aprons. Now they sell them for cash, and lay up
                    perhaps hundreds of dollars annually.</p>
            <p>Then pork, in the fall, was sold with difficulty in Vevay at from $1.25 to
                    $1.75 per 100 pounds; this last fall it sold in Vevay at from $11 to
                    $13 per 100 pounds. Corn then sold at from 12Â½ to 18Â¾ cents per
                    bushel, wheat 31Â½ to 37Â½ cents per bushel, potatoes from 6Â¼ to
                    18Â¾, cents per bushel, and all that were sold in town to the traders was paid for in
                    goods. In the spring bacon hams sold at from 2 to 2Â½ cents per pound, and sides and
                    shoulders in proportion.</p>
            <p>A farmer living a few miles from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in the fall of 1812, had about 1,000 pounds of pork, which he brought to Vevay to
                    sell, was offered $1.25 per 100 pounds, would not take that; took it to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> in a large perogue, where he realized $1.75 per 100 pounds, and was three
                    days and two nights coming up the river against the current with the perogue. Truly the farmers of <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland county</country>
                    </placeName> have had their lot cast in a pleasant country, and they may be thankful to Almighty God
                    for their good heritage.</p>
            <pb n="313" id="VAA4025-020-3-093"/>
            <p>After the termination of the War of 1812 with Great Britain many European emigrants came to Vevay and
                    the neighboring settlements in the county. During the years 1815, 1816, 1817, and 1818, great
                    numbers from Europe, seeking homes in the west came to this county; many of whom purchased lands and
                    permanently settled among us.</p>
            <p>A number of Scotch families, and some others, formed the settlement on Long Run about that time, but
                    the exact date and years is not now recollected. Among the Scotch who settled on Long Run were Niel
                    McCallum, Duncan McCallum, John McCallum, Donal Cowan, the Malcomsons, and perhaps one or two other
                    families. They were, in their religious persuasions, what are commonly denominated Seventh Day
                    Baptists. It was quite a novelty to the then population to see these good people apparently idle all
                    day of Saturdays, no one stirring about in the clearings and no sound of the axe to be heard, plied
                    by these hardy Scots in felling the forest trees. When on Sunday the passerby in that settlement
                    could see the men and boys at work clearing up the land which they designed for cultivation and hear
                    the sound of the woodman's axe as he plied it to fell some large oak or beech, and this too
                    while the passerby was wending his way to some appointment whither he was going to hear the word of
                    God expounded. Eventually these men lived to enjoy the fruits of their labor, and they have passed
                    from among us leaving behind them a good name, and their descendants to enjoy it to the fullest
                    extent the lands which their fathers cleared up for their use.</p>
            <p>Philip and John Romeril, from the Isle of Jersey, settled on Long Run above where these Scotch
                    settled, and opened a farm, and some years after while all were from home save a sister some demon
                    in human form passed by and with a deadly aim shot her with a leaden ball dead, and when the other
                    members of the family returned home they found her lying cold in death. Suspicion was fixed on a
                    person named Long, but no proof of his being the guilty one could be brought against him,
                    consequently he was set at liberty.</p>
            <p>The family of Detraz came to Vevay sometime in the fall of 1816 or summer of 1817. They had not been
                    here very long until the old gentleman, while bathing in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> river, <pb n="314" id="VAA4025-020-3-094"/> was drowned. The body was recovered at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>; an inquest was held over the body by Abner Clarkson, (now of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>,) who, being a justice of the peace in Jefferson county, acted as coroner. The remains
                    were interred at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where they are to remain until their final resurrection. The family left consisted of
                    three sons by a former wife, John, Benjamin, and Francis, his widow, (his second wife,) and two
                    sons, Abraham and Louis, who reside in Craig township, the latter living on the land purchased for
                    the home of the father and his family.</p>
            <p>About this time, perhaps 1818, Frederick L. Grisard, (now dead) and his brother in law, Belrichard,
                    came to Vevay and settled below Indian creek on the land owned by the LeClerc's, and part
                    by William Tilly, where Mr. Grisard carried on his occupation of blacksmithing for some years, when
                    he sold the land and came to Vevay and bought the lots where R. F. Grisard now resides. Mr.
                    Belrichard, who was a shoemaker by profession, carried on his trade for some years, when he finally
                    sold out and removed to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> where he died, leaving a son and daughter. It would be a novelty for some of your
                    readers to see a horse shod in the manner it was performed by Mr. Grisard for the writer, on more
                    than one occasion. It was performed, perhaps, by driving the nails in the usual manner, and for
                    trimming the hoof after the nails were driven the foot was placed on a sort of stool, and while
                    there was trimmed and rasped, one holding the horse's foot on the stool.</p>
            <p>Somewhere about this same time a Swiss named James Bolens came to Vevay and brought with him several
                    young men, who had not the means of paying their passage.</p>
            <p>Mr. Bolens married to Miss Pernet, a cousin of David E. Pernet, who resided so long at Mt. Sterling.
                    He settled near Mt. Sterling, where the mound stood, and lived in a neat and comfortable looking log
                    cabin for some time. He had brought with him to America a number of watches; and while living in the
                    cabin alluded to, the watches were hung up against the wall near a window fronting the road. One
                    night some thief in passing, removed a pane of glass, put his hand through and took some of the
                    watches. In the morning the watches were <pb n="315" id="VAA4025-020-3-095"/> missing. Mr. Bolens,
                    mounting a horse, rode to Vevay and secured the services of Jacob Malin and another, and started
                    down the river towards <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> in search of the thief, whom they overtook at or near Indian <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, still having in his possession the watches. The thief was placed on a horse, his feet
                    tied under the horse and his hands behind and brought back as far as "Uncle
                    Morerod's" gate, where they halted. The thief was given his choice of being taken
                    to town and put in jail and kept there until court, or take forty lashes on his bare back with a raw
                    hide. He chose the latter. He was taken back of "Uncle Morerod's" barn,
                    there tied to a tree, his back made bare, a bottle of wine given him to drink, which he swallowed,
                    when the forty stripes were well applied, when his back was washed with wine, his clothes replaced,
                    led back to the gate on the river bank, a bottle of wine given him to drink, and he advised to leave
                    and never to show himself in the neighborhood again. He made his way down the road in the direction
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>In 1821 or 1822 Mr. Bolens, being at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> with a cargo of pork, stopped at a hotel, on entering he observed a person sitting with
                    his face towards the door by which he entered, who so soon as Bolens entered, turned his face, and
                    he could not get a fair chance to see his face; but that man left the hotel the next day and was not
                    seen again by Bolens about <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Being unable to sell his pork at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> he went to Havana with it, and there he again encountered the man he had seen at the
                    hotel in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and again the man seemed to shun him and left the hotel where they had stopped. Bolens
                    was always of the belief that the thief who stole his watches, was whipped so unmercifully, and the
                    man he met at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and Havanna, were one and the same; and that while in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Havanna after he had seen him, he was somewhat uneasy lest he might be waylaid and
                    murdered by that man, and fully prepared himself for anything of the kind.</p>
            <p>About the year 1817 the family of David E. Pernet came to the country and settled at Mt. Sterling.
                    The father, becoming somewhat deranged, hanged himself in the barn. The land which was owned by him
                    then descended to David E. and <pb n="316" id="VAA4025-020-3-096"/> John Pernet, his sons. David E.,
                    who was so well and favorably known by the citizens of Mt. Sterling and the surrounding country,
                    turned his attention to farming and keeping a retail store and house of entertainment in Mt.
                    Sterling, for many years; when he finally sold out and removed to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bethlehem</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in Clark county, where he turned his attention to farming and keeping a retail store
                    until his death. John removed to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Covington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and afterwards went to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bethlehem</settlement>
                    </placeName> and entered into partnership with his brother in merchandising.</p>
            <p>About the same year the Thiebaud family came to this country and settled on a farm below Indian
                    creek, on which Justin Thiebaud now resides. If ever there was a family that could be said to be
                    industrious in the true meaning of that word the Thiebaud family were truly an industrious family.
                    The old lady was an extraordinary woman in many respects, she was a loving wife, a kind and
                    indulgent mother; a pious Christian, a good citizen, and one whose example, if followed, would lead
                    to prosperity and happiness. Many of the readers of this article will remember how she toiled and
                    worked to assist her husband and sons, (who were then small) to improve the farm and make it a
                    suitable home for them and their daughters, which she lived to see, and too all her sons and
                    daughters grown up and in prosperous business, useful members of society and ornaments in the church
                    of the Lord Jesus.</p>
            <p>The sons of the Thiebaud family are Charles, who lives on Main street, and carries on the boot and

            <p>It may seem to many a matter of small moment that anything of such personal reference to families and
                    persons should <pb n="317" id="VAA4025-020-3-097"/> be mentioned in these articles but let every one
                    reflect and ask themselvesâ€”What would I not give had my father, when a young man fifty,
                    sixty or seventy years ago, settling in this new country, committed to writing many of the incidents
                    relating to that settlement so that I might now have it before me to read, and know something of the
                    manner of life led by them in the wilderness?</p>
            <p>About 1817 the settlement in Pleasant township known as Dutch settlement began to be formed. Sometime
                    about that period Cornelies A. Voris, the Carnines, Demarees, Vandevers, Harmons, and some of those
                    old settlers came into the county from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, principally, and in a few years that part of the county began to increase in
                    population quite rapidly. It was not many years until the farmers from that portion of the county
                    began to supply the citizens of Vevay with provisions of all kinds, butter, eggs and chickens,
                    through the summer, pork, venison, oats, flax, etc., in the fall. They soon organized a church, and
                    built a log church not far from what once was called "Stapp's Store,"
                    near David Henry's. That log church has been replaced by a neat and comfortable frame
                    church, and is familiarly called the Dutch church. It belongs to the old school Presbyterian
                    denomination.</p>
            <p>On the west side of Pleasant township and south of Stapp's store being in the southwest
                    corner of the township, quite a number of Scotch families settled as early, perhaps, as 1817 and
                    1818, and their numbers were added to by accessions from time to time until quite a large settlement
                    of those industrious and worthy people was made, and extends over into the adjoining county of
                    Jefferson. Among the number now thought of were the four brothers William, James, John, and Samuel
                    Culbertson, the Mortons, Glenns, Makenzies, Scotts, and many others whose names are not now
                    recollected.</p>
            <p>In a few years these industrious people opened farms and were very successful in their farming
                    operations, and that section of the county is under a good state of cultivation.</p>
            <p>About this period John, James and Philip Schenck, his wife and his son Ulysses, then a lad of 10
                    years old, came to the country and settled on the hill back of the Thiebaud farm. Mr. Schenck was a
                    tinner by trade, and as there was no tinner <pb n="318" id="VAA4025-020-3-098"/> in town Mr. Schenck
                    came to town once or twice a week and gathered up all the tinware that required mending, took it
                    home with him and mended it when not engaged in the farm work, and returned it to the owners, and so
                    he mended the tinware for the citizens of the town for sometime, when he finally went to
                    Shippingport, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>; and there, during the time of the digging of the canal around the falls, he kept a
                    store, in which clothing, shoes and every other article required by the laborers on the canal, was
                    kept; and during the digging of the canal made a considerable amount of money, when he finally
                    purchased the farm on which he now lives from Louis Gex Oboussier, removing from Shippingport to the
                    farm in 1834 or 1835.</p>
            <p>His son, Ulysses P. Schenck, commenced business for himself during the time the canal was being made
                    and made a considerable amount of money in this business. He afterwards leased a lot fronting the
                    river near the mouth of the canal in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and continued his business for some years after his father removed to his farm and all
                    his surplus means was sent to his father, who loaned it out for the son at 10 per cent interest,
                    secured by mortgage. This he continued to do until 1837, when he purchased the lot on which his
                    large store stands, built a house suitable for dwelling and storeroom and commenced business there
                    in 1838.</p>
            <p>His prosperous and successful career as a merchant and trader is known to most of the farmers of <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland county</country>
                    </placeName>, and the pecuniary aid he has extended to many of our farmers in assisting them to buy
                    and improve farms, whereby they were enabled to make for themselves comfortable homes, is a proof of
                    his sagacity as a financier and business man. He may be said to be in the strictest sense of the
                    word a sagacious and shrewd business man.</p>
            <p>Frederick L. Grisard, one of our successful mechanics, came to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> with his father and mother in 1818 when he was about 10 years of age, remained with his
                    father until he arrived at a proper age to learn a trade, choosing the profession of a blacksmith
                    for his future occupation. In 1824 he placed himself under the instruction of a Mr. Oberlee of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, a proficient in the trade, and after serving a <pb n="319" id="VAA4025-020-3-099"/>
                    sufficient length of time to become acquainted with all the secrets of the trade, commenced business
                    in Vevay in 1827. where he continued in business, realizing good profits for his work, and having
                    gained the reputation of being the best workman of the kind in all the region round about for many
                    miles. As a proof of which it may be remarked that more blacksmiths went out from among the
                    apprentices instructed in his shop than from any shop in any town of the size of Vevay in the whole
                    country. The names of many of those who went out from under his instruction as votaries of Vulcan,
                    may not be uninteresting to the readers of these articles, are here given: Henry Hatch, William
                    Malcomson, Lewuel Siebenthal, Daniel Detraz, William Rochat, Joseph Jagers, and others who are not
                    now recollected.</p>
            <p>In the fall of 1816 or spring of 1817, Joseph Malin came to Vevay and commenced the saddle and
                    harness making business, which he continued to carry on very successfully until sometime in 1833 or
                    1834, when he turned the business over to others; James W. Cole, perhaps, being one of his
                    successors in that business. Mr. Malin had been merchandising for a few years in connection with the
                    saddle and harness making business and turning his attention entirely to merchandising, he entered
                    into that business very actively and with much success. He occupied one part of the house in which
                    Robert A. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox</region>
                    </placeName> now resides, on Main street, for a shop when he first came to the place, and then moved
                    into a small two-story frame which stood on or near the spot where the house stands on Market
                    street, occupied by Mr. Shaw, where he remained for several years, when he removed to a building on
                    Main street, about where the two-story frame occupied by J. C. Wells &amp; Co. and S. E.
                    &amp; J. K. Pleasants and adjoining to the house on the corner of Ferry and Main, in which he
                    carried on the mercantile business.</p>
            <p>Abner Clarkson came to Vevay in the fall of 1817, commenced the selling of goods in a room in the
                    building now occupied by Robert A. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox</region>
                    </placeName>, on Main street, and continued there until he completed his building on Ferry street
                    opposite to the present store of Harwood &amp; Son, where he continued in business for many
                    years, in a word he has been engaged in <pb n="320" id="VAA4025-020-3-100"/> business of some kind
                    ever since he came to Vevay in 1817 until the present day, and although in the 85th year of his age
                    he still attends to a grocery store.</p>
            <p>About the year 1816 or 1817 there came to this county a man by the name of Smith, who settled in the
                    neighborhood of Quercus grove which if not at that very place, whose object appeared to be to take
                    the bark of the oak and by grinding it, beating it in some manner, so that it could be packed in
                    hogsheads and shipped to Europe for coloring cloths and yarns. He selected a large tract of land at
                    Quercus grove which was heavily timbered with oak. Whether he purchased the land of individuals,
                    entered in congress, or became only a squatter is not known to the writer, suffice it to say that he
                    commenced his operations on quite a large scale, and succeeded in getting a sufficient quantity to
                    load one or two flatboats, which he sent to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> in charge of Edward Patton (whose name is familiar to most of the residents of <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland county</country>
                    </placeName> who have resided in the county since 1840,) as supercargo, which bark was sent to <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> and it is thought by the writer that Edward Patton went to <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> in charge of this shipment as supercargo. The writer is not certain whether any other
                    shipments of bark were made from the barkworks of this man Smith or not. Neither does he know to
                    what Smith was indebted for the cognomen that was applied to him by many of "Rarified
                    Smith," but is of the opinion that it was on account of some theory he had advanced of
                    using rarified air for the purpose of propelling machinery instead of steam. It may be that John
                    Gibbons, Esq., who lives on Grant's creek, may know and could give some better account of
                    this man "Rarified Smith" and his connection with the bark business at the
                    "barkworks," as his establishment was called in the great Quercus grove in Posey
                    township. It is thought that Smith left his "bark works" about 1821 or 1822, for
                    he had left there before the father and family of Martin R. Green came to that part of the county,
                    which was in 1823.</p>
            <p>For sometime after the close of the War of 1812 small change was very scarce, and it was with
                    difficulty that change could be made in the transaction of business. To obviate this difficulty the
                    practice of cutting a silver dollar into quarters <pb n="321" id="VAA4025-020-3-101"/> and eighths,
                    and silver half dollars into quarters and twelveand-a-half-cent pieces. In many cases to make the
                    most of a silver dollar and to turn a penny, instead of cutting it into eighth piece, nine pieces
                    would be made, thereby making an odd twelve-and-a-half cents. Sometimes persons who handled much of
                    this cut money would have their pockets so much worn as to make holes in them through which
                    occasionally and odd "ninepence" would be lost. To guard against such losses some
                    persons would have a leather pocket made, which was not so easily worn as the common cloth pocket.</p>
            <p>Some of the business men of the town resorted to issuing tickets for 61/4, 121/2, 183/4, 25 and 50
                    cents, which were received by all the men in business in town as change. These tickets were redeemed
                    whenever three or five dollars worth were presented, in current bank notes on the banks of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, or any other notes of banks in other states that were passing currently at the time.</p>
            <p>Lucien Gex, Rawleigh Day, John F. Dufour and one or two others, as also the corporation of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>, issued tickets which passed as currently here as the notes of any bank.</p>
            <p>To show the manner in which small change was secured, the following announcement to the public was
                    made, and the agreement of those in business in the town to take the small bills for their goods and
                    wares: <quote rend="blockquote">

                        <p>Considering the scarcity of small change and the solicitations of some of my friends, I have
                            been induced to issue small bills, redeemable with current bank notes. I intend keeping by
                            me at all times three and five dollar notes on the banks of <placeName>

                            thereof will change one of the notes aforesaid. If he has not of my bills to amount to three

                    who signed an agreement to receive the small bills, such bills were printed, signed, numbered and

            <p>At the time the stone jail was built the county commissioners, at the request of the contractors,

                    </placeName>, which was in existence at the commencement of the state government. In January, 1817,

                    thousand shares, were to be opened on the first day of April, 1817, in the several counties therein
                    named under the direction of persons named in the act, without naming any of the counties except <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName>. It may be said in relation to that county that the subscriptions were to be opened at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in said county, under <pb n="323" id="VAA4025-020-3-103"/> the direction of John
                    Gilliland, Laurence Nihell and Daniel Dufour for two hundred shares. The law further provided that
                    in addition to the counties named that subscriptions should be taken in each and every county
                    organized during that session of the General Assembly, or which might at any time thereafter be
                    organized. Said subscriptions to be taken at the seat of justice of each county, for any number of
                    shares not exceeding one hundred, at such times and in such manner as the General Assembly might
                    direct.</p>
            <p>The stock for the branch at Vevay was subscribed, and the bank went into active operation sometime
                    during the summer or fall of 1817, and continued in operation until February, 1820; when it,
                    together with the parent institution at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> and all other branches thereof, failed, and were brought into liquidation. In 1819 the
                    directors of the Vevay branch authorized the issuing of a certain amount of notes of one, three and
                    five dollars, and sent to the printers at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Reynolds &amp; Co., to have them printed. The notes thus printed were put in
                    circulation and passed very currently for some time. Here is the copy of a $5 note:

            <p>Unfortunately for the bank, by some mistake or otherwise, five hundred $5 bills more than
                    were authorized to be printed were printed, and signed by some person other than the president; and
                    many of them thus counterfeited were found in circulation. This fraud upon the bank was found out by
                    John F. Dufour, the president. In December, 1819, while in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, on business for the bank, calling on Hugh and James Glenn to receive $2,500
                    which they had collected of Elijah Pierson for the banks, one of the Glenns placed on the table
                    several bundles of the notes of the Branch Bank receivable in payment of debts, saying to Mr.
                    Dufour: <pb n="324" id="VAA4025-020-3-104"/>
                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Here are $2500 in Vevay receivables. I counted the most of them myself last night,
                            and some are in the same bundles as they came out of the Bank.</p>
                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Dufour was about taking the money without counting it over, but in looking in one of the bundles
                    he saw that ones, threes and fives were mixed together; he then concluded to count it. When in the
                    act of counting them he perceived some of the fives had a forged signature, which he threw out, and
                    told Glenn he would not receive them, as they were counterfeits. Glenn for some time insisted that
                    they were genuine. After considerable conversation between Glenn and Dufour they concluded to search
                    the other bundles and found a considerable number of the fives with forged signatures. The plate
                    appeared to be genuine. The number of these bills found in Mr. Glenn's possession were
                    probably between 150 and 200. Immediately on this discovery Mr. Dufour's suspicions were
                    aroused.</p>
            <p>So soon as Mr. Dufour left Glenn's he went to the printers who had printed the bills,
                    (Reynolds &amp; Co.) and upon inquiring there found that they had printed five hundred
                    $5 bills more than the bank had authorized, and they had been returned to the bank by the
                    person entrusted with having them printed.</p>
            <p>A statement of this affair was made by Mr. Dufour, in writing, prepared for the Royal Arch Chapter of
                    Masons, and was published in the <hi rend="i">Vevay Times</hi> and <hi rend="i">

                        <p>3rd. The choice of the lands being made by a majority of the associates upon the tracts or
                            sections No. 12 and 14, and the fractions 13 and 23, 2nd township, 3d range, containing in
                            the whole 1,879 70â€”100 acres registered on the 11th of June, 1802, having still
                            one tract or section to choose. But as fractions 13 and 23 are not together a whole section,
                            it follows that the total purchase amounts to but 2,519 70â€”100 acres which are
                            divided into thirteen shares containing each 193 80â€”100 acres and numbered from
                            West to East, to-wit: One for each of the following, John James Dufour, Daniel Dufour, John

                        <p>4th. The said lands being on the banks of the river <placeName>

                            </placeName>, and being surveyed diagonally with the river, it is agreed that each lot shall
                            meet the river, and its breadth upon said river shall be the following: The most western, or
                            No. 1, 67 poles; No. 2, 65 poles; No. 3, 63 poles, and so on; and in order to run at right
                            angles, the lines of length of each lot, said Dufour engages himself to do everything in his
                            power to obtain the fraction and section adjoining the western side; and in that case <pb n="327" id="VAA4025-020-3-107"/> every lot shall be drawn in length for the quantity, at
                            right angles with the course of the river upon the above breadth. But if in the course of
                            six years the said straightening cannot be made the lots shall remain parallel to the lines
                            north and south run by the survey. Agreed moreover that Francis Lewis de Siebenthal shall
                            have the lot No. 1, Philip Bettens that No. 2, John Daniel Morerod that No. 3, John Francis
                            de Siebenthal that No. 4, and the family Dufour the other nine lots. Being reserved here
                            that if the family Dufour furnishes John Francis de Siebenthal to the west end adjoining the
                            lot No. 1 as much ground measured in the same manner as the lot No. 4, the Siebenthal shall
                            be bound to received the said ground in lieu of No. 4, which shall belong to the family
                            Dufour; provided the said exchange takes place before the end of the year 1808.</p>
                        <p>5th. In order to establish order from the beginning it is agreed to leave a road 100 feet in
                            breadth along a line run on the second bank, which shall be planted with four rows of trees
                            at thirty-three feet distance, and fronting said road shall the buildings be placed.</p>
                        <p>6th. In order to indemnify the family of the Dufour's of the costs and trouble they
                            have been at (at least John James Dufour), by traveling in the <placeName>

                            Congress, it shall be given him or family the sum of $100 for each lot, to be
                            paid before the 1st of January, 1812, diminishing six per cent, unto the day of payment,
                            upon the sums that shall have been paid before said time.</p>
                        <p>As a security of the said covenant each of us engages the whole of his property present and

            <p>In relation to the road that is provided to be laid out 100 feet wide on the second bank, the writer
                    remembers when quite a small boy to have seen some of the trees on the bank in front of the Morerod,
                    Bettens, Golay (now Danglade) and de <pb n="328" id="VAA4025-020-3-108"/> Siebenthal (now Norrisey)
                    farms. The houses of which farms fronted to the road. He also recollects when the width of the road
                    was outside of the edge of the bank in front of the Morerod and Bettens tracts.</p>
            <p>As these colonists had been accustomed to use good cold spring water in their native country, which
                    came gushing out of the mountains it was very natural that they should in some manner furnish
                    themselves with such a necessary beverage in thisâ€”then new homeâ€”and as there
                    were no springs, they had to resort to the digging of wells. Mr. Morerod had one dug near his house
                    sometime in 1812 or â€˜13. Others were dug in the settlement; the depth of the wells in the
                    river bottom near Vevay were from 85 to 90 feet. Mr. Morerod's was about 85 feet deep.</p>
            <p>On the 7th of August,. 1815, John F. Dufour entered into a written contract with William Scott and
                    Samuel Smith to dig, curb with timber, and wall up with stone a well at or near the corner of said
                    Dufour's dwelling house in the town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Said well was to be of the same dimensions as to width and thickness of the walls as
                    that of Jean D. Morerod near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and to be of such a depth as always to have at least three feet of water in it. In
                    walling up that part where the water would rise moss was to be put between the stones to prevent the
                    sand from getting through. The curbing was to be commenced with the digging. As the well would be
                    near the corner of said Dufour's house, the said Scott and Smith obligated themselves to
                    pay said Dufour all damages that might be occasioned to his house in case the said well, or any part
                    thereof, should cave in before it was completely finished and for two years afterwards. The well was
                    to be completely finished by the 1st of November following, for which work said Dufour obligated
                    himself to pay them $2.871/2 per foot for every foot said well should measure in depth
                    when completely finished, to the depth of 70 feet, and $3 per foot for every foot over
                    and above 70 feet. The well was finished and was at the north corner of Market and Main cross
                    street, near the corner of the lot on which William Archer now resides. That well was used by the
                    whole town for a number of years. It measured when completed 87 feet in depth, and was in constant
                        <pb n="329" id="VAA4025-020-3-109"/> use until about the year 1839 or 1840, when cisterns began
                    to be built in considerable numbers in the town, when the use of the well was dispensed with and
                    filled up.</p>
            <p>Some time about the year 1821 or â€˜22, the exact period not now recollected, a girl of
                    eight or ten years of age, by the name of Elizabeth Hare, being at the well with others to get
                    water, by some accidental misstep lost her balance and fell headlong into this well. The other
                    children who were by the well at the time, were so terrified that they could with difficulty tell
                    what had happened, or who had fallen into the well. Mrs. Dufour was very much alarmed when she
                    learned that a girl had fallen into the well, as her two girls were at the time not to be
                    seenâ€”she imagining that the accident had befallen one of them. A crowd collected, and it
                    was soon ascertained from the affrighted children near the spot, that Elizabeth Hare had fallen into
                    the well. Edward Patten, in the meantime, drew off his coat, boots and socks, and causing the bucket
                    to be lowered into the well, descended by the rope to the bottom, placed the girl in the bucket,
                    fastening her to it in some way, and made signs to draw up, which was done, he following up by
                    holding to the rope with one hand, and sticking his toes into the cracks of the wall, and in that
                    manner reached the top with the girl in an insensible stage. She lingered for some days and then
                    died.</p>
            <p>Some time since there was published in one of the papers published in Vevay a collector's
                    receipt for taxes, perhaps for the year 1818. Here is the copy of a tax receipt given by the sheriff

            <p>There is neither date or any other mark by which it can be ascertained at what date or at what place
                    the foregoing lines were written, but it is known by some now living, and who attended the school of
                    Mr. J. F. Buchetee, that he was residing here in <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName> in 1812 or 1813, and that while here he became acquainted with the Swiss colonists.
                    Hence it is that while here he wrote the poem in Latin entitled "Empire of
                    Bacchus." It is also ascertained that at about the same period of time a person by the name
                    of Priestly came to the colony and remained for a short time. It is also ascertained that Priestly
                    was a good Latin scholar; hence it is thought that he translated this poem while in this colony.</p>
            <p>It is confidently believed that this is the first time this poem has been made public by being
                    published in a newspaper. So if any of the votaries of Bacchus should chance to see and read it, its
                    publication at this time will have performed the mission which its author designed it should. If the
                    original should be found it may yet be given to the public in a future number of these articles.</p>
            <p>Perhaps some account of the company that was chartered by the legislature of Indiana in 1818, by the
                    name of the "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> Canal Company," would not be out of place. That act incorporating the company
                    was passed January 14, 1818, and had for its object the making of a canal around the falls of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> river, on the Indiana side. The company was organized, a board of directors elected,
                    and James Scott selected as president. The company, by the act of incorporation or some act passed
                    afterwards, was authorized to raise money for the making of said canal by means of a lottery,
                    besides the subscription of stock by individuals. The board of directors appointed agents at all
                    points along the river for the purpose of receiving subscriptions of stock. In April, 1818, they
                    appointed John F. Dufour agent of the company at Vevay to receive subscriptions to the capital stock
                    of the company and the directors also appointed William Cotton and John Gilliland assistants to
                    promote and facilitate the business.</p>
            <p>Subscribers to the stock were required to pay $5 at the time of subscribing. The agent was
                    requested to receipt for monies paid by subscribers and to forward to the president of the board at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                    </placeName> a certified list of subscribers who had paid $5 on each share.</p>
            <pb n="333" id="VAA4025-020-3-113"/>
            <p>Subscribers thus certified were entitled, at the election for directors on the first Monday of July,
                    1818, to vote either personally or by proxy. What success the agent met with in receiving
                    subscriptions to stock in the company is not now known. It appears from the following letter of
                    instructions to J. F. Dufour that he was also an agent for the sale of lottery tickets for said
                    company:</p>

            <p>It appears the company by this time began to be looking after the funds due to them for subscriptions
                    of stock and on the sale of tickets by agents. For at a meeting of the board of directors on the
                    21st of September, 1819, the following resolutions were adopted: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>
                     <hi rend="i">Resolved</hi>, That the Treasurer of the Board be requested from time to time to
                            take the most effectual step to collect the sums due from the stockholders and the moneys in
                            the hands of the lottery agents, and that he be authorized to appoint an agent or agents for
                            that purpose and that the treasurer of the board of managers be requested forthwith to pay
                            over to the treasurer of the canal company the money remaining in his hands.</p>
                        <p>
                     <hi rend="i">Resolved</hi>, That if the treasurer shall find it necessary to appoint an agent
                            or agents to settle with or collect money from lottery agents, he shall be authorized to
                            empower the agent or agents so appointed by him to sell lottery tickets and to solicit
                            further subscriptions to the capital stock of the company.</p>
                        <p>
                     <hi rend="i">Resolved</hi>, That the treasurer be requested to forward a copy of the
                            resolution of the 7th of December, 1818, relating to the sale of tickets <pb n="337" id="VAA4025-020-3-117"/> on a credit to each of the lottery agents, and require their
                            punctual observance of the same; and that they forward certificates of the
                            cashiersâ€™ of the banks in which they may have made deposits in compliance of that
                            resolution.</p>

            <p>Samuel Gwathmey, treasurer of the board of directors, appointed Robert Wallace an agent for the
                    purpose of collecting moneys due the company, either on account of sale of lottery tickets or of the
                    subscription of stock in said company. On the 14th of October, 1819, the treasurer notified Mr.
                    Dufour that the drawing of the lottery was progressing weekly, and was expected to continue in that
                    way till completed and that he would be furnished from time to time with a statement of the drawing.</p>
            <p>There does not appear to have been much advance made in the object of the canal company, other than
                    the drawings of the lottery already given in a former number.</p>
            <p>The commencement of the canal was made on the first Monday in May, 1818. At which time there was much
                    eating, drinking and speaking done, but with but little effect so far as the making of the canal was
                    concerned. The canal was commenced, a rod or two, or perhaps more, dug a few feet deep, and then all
                    came to a dead stop. Whether any person made money by the operation or not is not now certainly
                    known.</p>
            <p>It does not appear that any of the notes given for lottery tickets ever were paid or fell into the
                    hands of the managers of the lottery or the treasurer of the canal company.</p>
            <p>In November, 1817, the grand Masonic hall lottery commenced drawing and in December, 1817, William C.
                    Keen gave notice that a few tickets, warranted undrawn could yet be had at the original price of
                    $10. This lottery it is believed, also failed in realizing the expectations of those who
                    had the management of its affairs.</p>
            <p>On the 30th of January, 1818, the Literary Society of Vevay had a meeting at the office of Samuel
                    Merrill, which was convened in pursuance of the notice, and for the purpose set forth in that notice
                    which was as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>Whether Mr. Thiebaud ever effected an exchange by which he obtained his mare again is not known to
                    the writer.</p>
            <p>In the early settlement of this part of Indiana there was a law of congress in force by which section
                    21, and perhaps section 22, in every congressional township were usually called reserved lands; and
                    the price was fixed on such lands at $4 per acre. Under that law George Turner, who lived
                    on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> side of the river above the head of Vevay island, became the purchaser of the
                    south-east quarter of section 21, township 2, range 2. In 1818 he advertised that quarter section of
                    land for saleâ€”requiring one-fourth of the purchase money in hand, the balance at the end
                    of three years with interest.</p>
            <p>Whether he sold that land at that time or soon afterwards is not known, but David Miller became the
                    purchaser of that quarter section of land, but at what date is not known. However some of the heirs
                    of George Turner have lately had a suit pending against David Miller in one of our courts for their
                    interest in the land; as an error was made in selling the interest of said heirs while minors by the
                    guardian, perhaps, <pb n="339" id="VAA4025-020-3-119"/> by deeding a different quarter of land in a
                    different section from the quarter and section petitioned to be sold.</p>
            <p>At the time Mr. Turner paid $4 per acre for that land there was equally as good land in
                    the neighborhood to be had at $2 per acre.</p>
            <p>At one time there was in Vevay an ox saw mill, built on the bottom of what is now the corner of Ferry
                    and â€” streets. It was built by two brothers, Robert and Francis Bonner, the former the
                    father of Mrs. Ungles, who was in Vevay at the time of the death of her aunt, Mrs. Margaret
                    Armstrong, the latter was the father of Francis Bonner, who is now residing in Vevay and carrying on
                    the blacksmith business. The mill had a large tread wheel, upon which had to be placed from four to
                    six heavy oxen to cause it to run with sufficient force to do any execution. The mill never did much
                    in the way of sawing lumber, and was built about the year 1818 or 1819.</p>
            <p>About the same time, or perhaps a year later, Judge James Lee, father-in-law of Stephen C. Stevens,
                    came to Vevay and built an ox grist mill on the lot now occupied by Dr. J. W. Thompson, and the lot
                    adjoining thereto. This mill was designed to manufacture all the wheat raised in this part of the
                    county, but proved a failure in every respect. The tread wheel was an enormous wheel, upon which had
                    to be placed some six or eight heavy oxen to run the mill. It never did anything in the manufacture
                    of flour, but proved an unprofitable investment for the owner, and the utter failure in realizing
                    the expectations of Judge Lee.</p>
            <p>Some years afterward Joshua Smithson erected a carding machine on the lot now occupied by John
                    Gill's mill. Mr. Smithson continued the carding business by horse power for some time, and
                    erected a cotton gin, on which he ginned many hundreds of pounds of cotton raised in this
                    neighborhood annually for many years. Finally Mr. Smithson procured a steam engine, and commenced
                    with a grist mill attached to the carding machine. When, sometime in 1834, â€˜35, or
                    â€˜36 he exchanged his mill and all the machinery to Wm. C. Keen for the Printer's
                    Retreat farm.</p>
            <pb n="340" id="VAA4025-020-3-120"/>
            <p>George G. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox</region>
                    </placeName> after having carried on the cabinet making business for many years, erected a carding
                    machine on the corner of Main and Main cross streets, which he run for some years, and finally
                    attached a grist mill to it on which he made excellent flour.</p>
            <p>Vevay has had many hotels in it since its existence as a town, Robt. M. Trotter being perhaps the
                    first person to keep a house of public entertainment in the townâ€”his exact location the
                    writer has forgotten, but it was either on the lot now owned by Col, Ormsby, and cultivated as a
                    garden, or on the lot owned by John F. Doan, on which he has recently erected his fine residence,
                    and which was about the year 1816 and 1817 occupied by Thomas Armstrong as a tavern stand, until he
                    removed to his new frame on Market street, being the house now occupied by John L. Thiebaud as a
                    residence.</p>
            <p>William T. Huff kept a house of public entertainment in a two story brick on the present site of the
                    Le Clerc House for many years. William Bradley kept the same house in 1819 and 1820, when he removed
                    to a new house erected on the lot corner of Market and Union streets, now owned by John Melcher.</p>
            <p>The two-story brick on the corner of Ferry and Main street, the present site of the LeClerc House was
                    occupied by many others not now recollected except Amos Gilbert, who built the "Russell
                    House," who occupied it from 1827 to about 1832 or â€˜33; when shortly after it
                    was purchased by Robert LeClerc, who occupied it for some years, when he removed it to make place
                    for the present fine building occupied by his widow.</p>
            <p>Jonas Baldwin kept a house of public entertainment in 1817 or â€˜18 at the corner of Market
                    and Ferry streets, in a new frame building he had erected there, and which still stands there, and
                    is now owned by Mrs. Elizabeth Dalmazzo, widow of Joseph Dalmazzo.</p>
            <p>In the early days of the settlement of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and until perhaps in 1825 and â€˜26 it was customary for families to have the
                    shoes and clothing for the family made up at home. In order to have this done calfskins, upper and
                    sole leather was purchased and taken home a shoemaker engaged to come to <pb n="341" id="VAA4025-020-3-121"/> the house and take the measure for all shoes to be made for each member
                    of the family; and in the course of about two weeks shoes for a whole family of six or eight persons
                    would be finished, to last them for the whole year. In like manner cloth, thread and buttons were
                    bought and taken home, a tailor engaged to come to the house and cut and make the necessary clothes
                    for the men and boys for the whole year. In this manner the writer remembers well when his father
                    would, in the fall, bring in the stock of leather and cloth, and say that the shoemaker and tailor
                    would come perhaps the next week to make the shoes, coats, vests and pantaloons for the family. The
                    price paid the shoemaker was about $8 or $10 a week, and the tailor about the
                    same, and perhaps a little less. Oh, how the good old times have changed.</p>
            <p>As has been stated in a former number, that during the early settlement of the Swiss colony and for
                    some years afterwards, there was but one physician, Charles Muret. It is believed he was perhaps the
                    only physician in the settlement until about the year 1813 or 1814, when a Dr. Norton came to Vevay
                    and commenced the practice of medicine.</p>
            <p>The next physician who came to the town was Dr. John Mendenhall, who came in 1815 or 1816, who
                    commenced the practice of his profession and had quite an extensive and lucrative practice for many
                    years, in fact until his age prevented him from paying attention to calls from the country any
                    distance from town, and going about at night.</p>
            <p>About the year 1816 or 1817, Dr. James Welch, who was also a Presbyterian minister, came to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>, bringing with him a large stock of dry goods. He commenced the mercantile business, as
                    also the practice of his medical profession, preaching on the Sabbath in the court house. About the
                    year 1818 or â€˜19 he built the large brick building corner of Market and Main cross
                    streets. One room in the corner of the main building was occupied as a storeroom, the one
                    immediately in its rear being used as the counting-room, and one room in the ell as a drug store;
                    the latter being attended to by his son, Geo. W. Welch, who died about the year 1820. Dr. Welch, it
                    was said, was in the habit of using intoxicating liquors as a beverage to excess, and often has the
                    writer heard him tell his <pb n="342" id="VAA4025-020-3-122"/> congregation from the pulpit during
                    his sermons, "Do as I tell you, and not as I do." Referring no doubt to his habit
                    of using intoxicating drinks frequently to excess. Be that as it may, the church judicature
                    instituted proceedings against him sometime in 1825 or â€˜26 and after an investigation of
                    the case he was silenced as a minister, and shortly afterwards died, as was said by some, from
                    mortification at the decision made against him.</p>
            <p>The judicature that condemned Dr. Welch was presided over by Joshua L. Wilson, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, who was so long connected with the First Presbyterian church at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Dr. Edward Stall, a regular physician, formerly from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                    </placeName>, came to Vevay soon after and remained for several years. He finally left and removed
                    to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>. One of his daughters married a Mr. Wolf and resides in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rushville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in this state. Her husband was in the service during the rebellion and was killed or
                    died. A son, who is at present or was a short time since auditor of Rush county, was also in the
                    service and served as an officer with distinguished honor to himself and the cause he espoused.</p>
            <p>The year 1820 was a very sickly year along the water courses in the West, and Vevay did not escape
                    from the sad effects of sickness during the latter part of the summer and fall of that year. It was
                    estimated that the population of the town and the immediate vicinity (say between Indian and Plumb
                    creeks, in the bottom, between the river and the foot of the hill) at that time numbered about 600
                    souls. For during the spring of that year great numbers of persons came down the river in small
                    flatboats, mostly from Olean Point, seeking a home in this part of the country; many stopping at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in fact, so many that every house in the place was filled to overflowing. In many
                    instances two and three families, with from four to six souls in each family, were crowded into a
                    small tenement. As a natural consequence, when sickness once entered one of these crowded tenements
                    none escaped and in many instances out of from eight to twelve in one of these crowded tenements,
                    there would not be one left well enough to attend those that were sick; and, as might be <pb n="343" id="VAA4025-020-3-123"/> expected, many died from want of proper attention who perhaps would
                    otherwise have lived.</p>
            <p>Truman Richards, a young lawyer from the state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, an estimable young man, who was writing for J. F. Dufour in the clerk's
                    office, fell a victim to the dreadful scourge. His estate was administered on by Dr. William
                    Stephenson, a brother-in-law of Judge Stephen C. Stevens. The interest in the estate was sold by the
                    heirs who resided in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> to Jonathan Hawkins, the father of Ainsworth Hawkins and Mrs. Rosetta Ransom. By this
                    sale of the estate by the heirs there is nothing to be seen standing in the graveyard to mark where
                    his remains were deposited, save, perhaps a rough lime stone with the letter R roughly cut on it.
                    This ought not be thus, for Mr. Richards was a most estimable young man, and his remains deserve a
                    better memorial. But, as he died in a strange land among strangers, far away from home and friends,
                    it cannot be expected to be otherwise.</p>
            <p>It might be proper here to state that instead of there being but two lawyers or attorneys at law
                    buried in the Vevay cemetery, there are certainly known to be four: Truman Richards, James M. Kyle,
                    Aurelius W. Dumont and Robert Drummond. The three latter of whom many of your readers, especially in <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland county</country>
                    </placeName> will doubtless recollect.</p>
            <p>Among those who it is recollected dealt out the "0 be joyful" to their thirsty
                    customers in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>, within the recollection of the writer, may be mentioned; Frederick and Otis Waldo, who
                    kept their shop at the corner of Ferry and Market streets for several years, when they commenced
                    keeping dry goods. The latter was the father of 0. S. and F. J. Waldo and the former was their
                    grandfather.</p>
            <p>Edward Patton, who kept whisky, cider and wine to sell by the "small" in a log
                    house opposite to the residence of J. L. Thiebaud on Market street, and on the lot on which 0. S.
                    Waldo's residence stands.</p>
            <p>
               <placeName>
                        <country reg="is">Israel</country>
                    </placeName> R. Whitehead had an establishment on the lot where Mathias Madary now resides. He also
                    had a bakery, which was attended to in the mechanical department of Mr. Madary for a few years, when
                    Mr. Madary bought the house and lot <pb n="344" id="VAA4025-020-3-124"/> and set up for himself, and
                    carried on a thriving business in the bakery and retailing liquors.</p>
            <p>An anecdote worthy of relating took place about this time: A law had been enacted by the legislature
                    of Indiana requiring the boards doing county business to procure and keep in the office of the clerk
                    of the county a standard of weights and measures. These had been procured and placed in possession
                    of Edward Patton, who was then clerk of the county. One day the clerk visited some of the shops and
                    places where liquors were sold at retail, not by the drink, but by the gill, half-pint, etc. Calling
                    in at Mr. Madary's the clerk informed him that he had called to try his weights and
                    measures. And as the glasses on the counter and shelves were third pints instead of half-pints, Mr.
                    Madary called on his wife to bring him the "big tumblers." It is useless to say
                    anything further of this matter than that it was a joke gotten up by the clerk for his own sport.</p>
            <p>Later years brought upon the stage as retailers of spiritous liquors as a beverage, William Shaw and
                    Ladig Rous, who were in their day the most popular caterers to the appetites of their numerous
                    customers, who could be counted by hundreds, in arranging mint juleps, Tom and Jerry, Irish and
                    Italian punch, etc. During their continuance in that business they were very successful and made
                    considerable money, and eventually abandoned that business which was carried on at the corner of
                    Ferry and Main streets, where J. C. Well's store is kept, but in a different building, and
                    entered into the dry goods and grocery business.</p>
            <p>Percy Rous was also engaged in the retail liquor trade in this place, and from appearances did a
                    tolerably fair business, but did not continue at it for any considerable length of time.</p>
            <p>Many others have been engaged in the retail liquor trade in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>, who have left long since, and who did not make much of a mark in the business. Some of
                    our most prominent business men have at some time during their lives been engaged in the business.</p>
            <p>There is perhaps no business on which the opinion of many persons has undergone so radical a change
                    as the business of <pb n="345" id="VAA4025-020-3-125"/> retailing spirituous liquors. Many who were
                    engaged in it, and secured quite a competency of this world's goods, thought it a laudable
                    business and respected those engaged in it as men of good moral character and good citizens, now
                    hold the opinion that no man of good moral character will engage in the
                    "iniquitous" traffic.</p>
