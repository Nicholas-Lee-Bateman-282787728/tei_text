                         in health and welfare initiatives that sought to improve the well-being of
                         the state and its residents. With hindsight, we can see that the

                         contradictory, and evolved in intriguing ways over time. This special issue

                         shaped by a concern with policing the boundaries of an emergent and

                         examine myriad manifestations of eugenics in their particular

                    <p>Framed broadly and situated locally, each article in this special issue
                         demonstrates that the doctrine of human improvement deployed by Hoosier
                         reformers, while firm in the goal of enhancing well-being, was protean and
                         could change over time. In her essay on the female field workers who
                         carried out eugenic family studies, Kendra Clauser-Roemer shows how these
                         professional women shifted the emphasis of the Indiana Committee on Mental
                         Defectives away from the fatalist perspective that next to nothing could be
                         done for those deemed defective, to a more sanguine approach that touted
                         the promise of environmental and social interventions. In a similar vein,
                         Jennifer Burek Pierce provides a candid and enlightening portrait of the
                         long-serving health secretary John N. Hurty that eloquently captures the
                         personal and professional versatility of the man remembered as

                    <p>In practical terms, eugenics sought to distinguish and segregate the
                         &quot;normal&quot; from the &quot;abnormal,&quot; to implement preventive
                         measures of public health and social hygiene, above all those related to
                         sexuality and marriage, and to regiment education through school
                         standardization and mental testing. To a great extent, eugenics was about
                         creating and enforcing a new normality that was informed by the
                         consolidating sciences of heredity, statistics, and medicine, and in which
                         the white middle class was held up as both as the norm and the ideal to be
                              attained.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> In addition, eugenics helped to

                         a period in which teachers and psychologists were creating a large
                         repertoire of instruments to classify and track students according to their
                         putatively inherent intelligence. As Osgood shows, <placeName><region

                         of special education programs.</p> 
                    <p>One of the strengths of these articles is that they illuminate the
                         multi-dimensional character of eugenics in Indiana by profiling historical
                         actors who have received little scholarly attention, such as field worker
                         Edna Jatho or pioneer of special education Donald DuShane. This novel
                         research and analysis helps to populate the cast of characters studied in

                         Furthermore, it points to the critical role that a rising class of degreed
                         professionals played in setting the agendas of the state&apos;s
                         institutions and health and welfare programs. As the authors illuminate the
                         Hoosier ties and orbits of these historical figures, they also place them
                         in their regional and national contexts, emphasizing how the doctrines of

                         had, to some acclaim, lobbied for a general expansion of the state&apos;s
                         public health laws intended to ensure a healthy citizenry, initiated
                         campaigns against diseases like tuberculosis, and worked zealously to
                         improve the physical condition of public schools. He was also instrumental
                         in ensuring the quality of water, food, and medicine; his lobbying efforts
                         at the state level preceded the national Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 by
                         nine years. Many scholars have argued that Hurty&apos;s law formed the
                         model for the federal legislation; an early biographer claimed that he was
                         a key voice urging <hi rend="i">Ladies&apos; Home Journal</hi> editor

                    <p>In 1915, Hurty experienced a significant legislative threat to his status: a
                         new bill gave the governor the ability to fill Hurty&apos;s position by
                         appointment, rather than allow members of the public health board to elect
                         their own leader. While his career hung in the balance, Hurty&apos;s
                         colleagues at the Indianapolis Medical Society considered his legacy.
                         Certain he had provided the sort of leadership that should be celebrated,

                         tributes to the beleaguered health officer that created a portrait of the

                         Amidst serious commentary on the significance of the changes Hurty had
                         implemented through health regulations, a mock beauty pageant contrasted
                         an ailing Miss Indiana of 1896 with a Miss Indiana of 1915 whose bloom of
                         youth and health were meant to epitomize the secretary&apos;s
                         accomplishments.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> Guests celebrated his work and his words, even as they
                         teased him about his cantankerous attitude and the quirks of his diet.
                         Rhode Island secretary of the State Board of Health Gardner T. Swarts,
                         toasted—and teased—Hurty from afar: &quot;May good health and a long regime
                         be the allotment of Dr. Hurty and his consuming appetite for catsups,
                         doctored sauces and other pickled things not be a bar to his good
                         digestion at this joyful dinner.&quot;<hi rend="sup">7</hi> More than one person present
                         wondered how the state would eventually remember Hurty, yet none doubted
                         that his leadership would be commemorated by grateful future citizens.
                    </p>
                    <p>Hurty also was concerned about how his innovative career would be remembered,
                         well aware that by 1915 he had generated a record of service almost as
                         distinctive for its duration as its agenda. In <placeName><region

                         challenged his ideas about disease prevention, and legislators attacked his
                         views. Because of the many successes that resulted from his evangelistic
                         approach to health promotion, he became known as &quot;<placeName><region

                         professional judgment expressed at the honorary dinner, in tandem with a
                         groundswell of popular support within the state, indicated that Hurty had
                         considerable clout. While state health officers at the turn of the 
                         previous century have been described as &quot;largely powerless and
                         ineffective,&quot; Hurty, for good or ill, defied this characterization.<hi

                    <p>Hurty&apos;s work represented a microcosm of Progressive-era reform activity,

                         uplift, and righteousness. His belief in the benefits that could accrue
                         from scientific innovation and progressive advocacy did not prevent him
                         from forming harsh judgments about poor rural families, criminals, and

                         re-evaluation of Hurty&apos;s life and influence is likewise salient when
                         the eugenic norms he advocated are analyzed and discussed at the distance
                         of a century. Hurty&apos;s interest in health improvement was both local
                         and global, equally motivated by his sense of responsibility and his
                         blinding righteousness. His reform efforts reached in many directions: from
                         his interest in school children&apos;s health sparked by his father&apos;s
                         activism to his determination, generated by an international movement, to
                         stem the spread of syphilis. Hurty brought his convictions about healthy
                         behaviors and environments to bear in all aspects of his life, even in his
                         leisure activities. He was not by nature a humanitarian—he was attracted to

                    <p>John Hurty was a midwesterner, and a fourth-generation American of German

                         later a school superintendent, had a rather peripatetic career during
                         John&apos;s childhood. These years also seemed to be characterized by a
                         certain amount of conflict between the strong-willed father and his equally
                         willful son, although Hurty remembered his father fondly.<hi rend="sup"
                              >12</hi> Josiah Hurty had firm notions about standards of cleanliness
                         and health involving fresh air and frequent bathing that were
                         unconventional in the post-Civil War years; these practices, enforced at
                         home during John&apos;s upbringing, were also carried into Josiah&apos;s
                         school rooms, often to the indignation of local citizens. Hurty once
                         explained what he learned from the dissent that marked his father&apos;s
                         career: &quot;My father was ridiculed and received much abuse for

                         of wellness that he gained at home; he also seemed to internalize his
                         father&apos;s disregard for criticism of unpopular professional conduct,
                         adopting the same uncompromising attitude in his own career.</p>
                    <p>Much of what is commonly known about Hurty&apos;s childhood and young
                         adulthood has been preserved through the efforts of Thurman B. Rice,

                         and an apologist for Hurty. Rice&apos;s research on Hurty extended to
                         reading notations in his for- mer employer&apos;s family Bible, perusing
                         Josiah&apos;s scrapbooks from his days as a teacher, interviewing surviving
                         family members, and constructing a Hurty family tree that traced their
                         lineage back to Revolutionary-era hero Ethan Allen.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>
                         Rice&apos;s fascination with Hurty&apos;s family origins suggested that the
                         two men shared interests in breeding and the conditions of family life as
                         determinants of vigor and success. Ironically, it was Rice who emphasized
                         conflict and disagreement between Hurty and his father.</p>
                    <p>Whatever disagreements Hurty had with his father, his career repeatedly
                         suggested the elder man&apos;s influence, and Hurty himself acknowledged
                         this on occasion. In the last months of his life, when he lectured on
                         hygiene at the Indiana Dental College, Hurty described the individual as
                         the product of environment, education, and heredity. He told his students
                         that genetic inheritance and upbringing made the self; these facets of
                         being were the core of individual health.<hi rend="sup">15</hi> He saw his
                         life in these terms, too, which was understood by his colleagues near and

                                   in his dental hygiene classes, Hurty continued to espouse eugenic
                                   ideology, arguing that people are the products of what they have,
                                   who they are, and what they do.</p>

                         single-mindedness as, in fact, very human. However, those who knew Hurty
                         only through the laws and health promotion activities he created seldom
                         shared this sense of the state&apos;s health secretary as loved and loving
                         man, shaped by his family. Hurty&apos;s perspective on health derived from
                         his construction of his personal identity as much as it rested on public
                         policy, yet he touted the strengths of scientific health management, rather
                         than the lessons learned from his father.</p>
                    <p>Hurty&apos;s professional life began with an ordinary pharmacy job in

                         partnership with Dr. John Johnstone. Shortly thereafter, Hurty became

                         pharmacist, he married Dr. Johnstone&apos;s daughter Ethel in 1877, and
                         together they had two children. In 1879, when the Johnstone-Lilly
                         partnership broke up, Hurty opened his own drug store.<hi rend="sup"

                         became secretary of the State Board of Public Health, Hurty had also
                         operated his own chemical analysis company, specializing in water purity.
                         This dimension of his expertise was acknowledged by others in the business,
                         during the dust-up of 1915, when he was elected president of the Indiana
                         Sanitary and Water Supply Association, and again later in 1945, when the
                         Indiana Department of Environmental Management created an award in

                         communicated with numerous activists within the state&apos;s borders and
                         beyond, including John Harvey Kellogg, whose own health tracts and
                         involvement with the Race Betterment Conference evinced values Hurty found
                         sympathetic, and Prince A. Morrow, whose American Society for Moral and
                         Sanitary Prophylaxis also influenced Hurty&apos;s activities. Despite these
                         interactions, Hurty sometimes perceived himself as embattled and unaided,
                         his career reflecting the fortunes of the state health office—regarded as
                         vulnerable; marked by the need to balance scientific knowledge, media
                         savvy, and political skills; and threatened by frequent resignations of
                         agency heads. Instead of diplomatically presenting his specialized
                         knowledge to advocates who would help him make his case, Hurty returned his
                         critics&apos; scorn. The strains of this period of reform seemed to demand
                         the fortitude that Hurty brought to every encounter.</p>

                         like the American Eugenics Society to local conditions. But Hurty diverged
                         somewhat from this model, primarily holding memberships in national
                         professional organizations, rather than in local groups that often mingled

                         reforms, Hurty encountered what public health historian John Duffy has
                         described as &quot;the clash between individual liberty and the public

                         distance,&quot; enhanced the potential for conflict as Hurty attempted to
                         direct the state&apos;s citizenry in matters as sensitive as their sexual
                         conduct and as close to the hearth as child-raising.<hi rend="sup">24</hi>
                         Hurty invested his entire effort in public health, spurning the idea that
                         he could protect individual rights as well as the public welfare.</p>
                    <p>Hurty&apos;s contemporaries regarded his relentless energy and attention to
                         matters of well-being as crucial for improving public health in the early
                         twentieth century; however, the citizens whose lives he sought to protect
                         sometimes saw his actions as intrusive, expensive, or simply unnecessary.
                         It is unsurprising, then, that Hurty was threatened with (yet survived)
                         more than one political effort to unseat him-the first in 1911, and another
                         in 1915.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> In the intervening years, Hurty had been
                         elected president of the American Public Health Association, one sign of
                         how the larger health community regarded the efforts that seemed to
                         jeopardize his career in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"

                         At the same time that the state lagged behind its neighbors in industrial
                         development and other signs of modernization, Hurty developed a national
                         reputation as a leading health officer. Regardless of Hurty&apos;s long
                         tenure and accomplishments, by 1915 the balance seemed to tip in favor of
                         his detractors, when a bill proposed in the Indiana House of
                         Representatives tried to remove the Republican Hurty from his position by
                         allowing the Democratic governor to appoint the Board of Health&apos;s
                         secretary. The entire state watched the ensuing drama.</p>

                         during Hurty&apos;s lifetime. He served as health secretary from 1896 until
                         1922, retiring from his position only three years before his death. Further
                         accolades, though none with the fervor of 1915, followed his resignation.
                         The voices that touted his accomplishments described Hurty as
                         forward-looking, seeing possibilities for well-being where disease had
                         prevailed. Many others recognized that Hurty&apos;s official actions,
                         always contentious, were being scrutinized by the Indiana Supreme Court. In
                         1921, the court found that the sterilization legislation for which Hurty
                         had lobbied in 1907 violated the state constitution.</p>

                         was passed in 1905, followed by one permitting sterilization of the

                         interest. The inevitable institutionalization of these individuals was
                         costly, Hurty and other proponents argued, and preventing their vices from
                         being propagated was key to social improvement. When private individuals
                         and public officials from around the country consulted Hurty about the

                         astonishingly frank about strategies for securing his desired end. Hurty

                    <p>Hurty recognized that the legislature would not allow his scrutiny to intrude
                         as far into marriages and intimate relationships as he would have liked; he
                         depended instead on a range of opportunities, in print or in person, to
                         promote his views. He seemed to relish publicity, not for his own sake but
                         for the causes he supported. Each notice seemed to be a small victory in
                         the battle Hurty perceived himself waging against disease and other
                         conditions that required the state to spend its money on what he regarded
                         as irreparable illness and debilitation. When his talks were lauded, he
                         celebrated his successes; when he was criticized, he redoubled his efforts
                         in pursuit of the goals he had established for others&apos; lives.<hi

                         questioned Hurty about another prominent eugenicist&apos;s position on
                         the death penalty, Hurty explained away the concerns, adding his own
                         endorsement of the troubling sentiments: &quot;Dr. Bellfield did not advise
                         the killing of criminals and degenerates. He did say the graveyard was the
                         best place for all who are unfit to live.... He made a great speech and I
                         support every word that he said.&quot;<hi rend="sup">40</hi> To Hurty, Bellfield&apos;s
                         assessment was logical. The use of reason, he argued, supported
                         sterilizing those who had been judged unfit. &quot;I think the rational
                         scientific method is to stop the procreation of criminals, idiots, etc.
                         The farmer finds this method efficient and effective with animals and with
                         trees. Man is only a highly endowed animal. He is subject to the same laws
                         as are animals,&quot; Hurty maintained.<hi rend="sup">41</hi> He alternated between this
                         detached scientific idealism and moralism, describing &quot;the

                         podium. He took an active stand against the threat of contagion among the
                         rural poor. Some <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"
                                   >Indiana</region></placeName> residents appreciated his
                         willingness to visit farms and small towns, yet the manner in which these
                         visits were conducted at times provoked antagonism. Hurty&apos;s personal
                         involvement in hygiene reform, his attitudes toward the state&apos;s
                         predominantly rural families, and the resentment his actions and attitudes
                         created were evident in various instances. In one such case, Hurty assisted
                         a regional health official in managing a particularly virulent diphtheria
                         epidemic. Hurty described the situation: <quote rend="blockquote">What
                              could health officers do under the circumstances? A dilapidated
                              shanty, two beds covered with worn and filthy bed clothes and all
                              reeking with virulent diphtheria germs. Two dead children, three sick
                              and with the awful disease, pigs and chickens at the front and back
                              doors, spreading filth all around and ever anon entering the house to
                              be driven out by the old grandmother; and lastly, the father and
                              mother, stolid and ignorant, standing around with vacant stare doing
                              nothing.... The dilapidated house and its contents could never be
                              disinfected. Afterward we besought the commissioners to burn the house
                              and all it contained, and supply one equally as good with proper
                              furnishings. Against this, the sacred rights of property and
                              economy....This was not the first set of officials I had found who
                              regarded health, life and happiness as of less importance than
                              property rights and the making of a political record for economy.<hi

                    <p>The rich as well as the poor received criticism from Hurty. He interpreted
                         social worker Robert Hunter&apos;s treatise on Poverty as supporting his
                         own positions on &quot;degenerates and paupers,&quot; noting that Hunter
                         declared &quot;the exceedingly rich&quot; to be paupers too, &quot;because

                         austere vision of life: &quot;What we all want is better order in our daily

                         imposing this modern sort of stoicism on others.</p>
                    <p>Hurty required money to carry out the varied programs he considered necessary
                         for the state&apos;s improvement. He complained to one writer whom he hoped
                         would petition the legislature in support of his budget increases: &quot;It
                         would be an economy, for it is obvious if the public health can be uplifted
                         even one per cent, that the people will be made more prosperous and happy,

                    <p>Vital statistics were another of his signature interests. He insisted on

                                   touting the benefits of hygienic baby care, this room gave
                                   medical professionals a place in which to evaluate babies and
                                   educate their parents in the principles championed by Hurty.</p>

                         reporting raw numbers, Hurty also commented
                         on the trends that they represented. To him, the figures measured whether
                         the state&apos;s residents were more susceptible to disease than to

                    <p>In 1914, Hurty published The Indiana Mothers&apos; Baby Book, a treatise on
                         healthful childraising that informed subsequent outreach efforts such as
                         the Better Babies Contest at the Indiana State Fair.<hi rend="sup">51</hi> These endeavors
                         in infant hygiene were like many of Hurty&apos;s projects, reflecting an
                         amalgam of his philosophies of well-being and national health programs. In
                         this instance, Hurty&apos;s Baby Book brought forward the eugenic

                         Creed&quot; which asserted that &quot;Every child has the inalienable right
                         to be born free from disease, free from deformity and with pure blood in
                         its veins and arteries.&quot;<hi rend="sup">52</hi> Although the 
                         anti-venereal disease campaign was brought to an end by legislative pressure, it
                         was quickly revived under the guise of supporting infant health.<hi
                              rend="sup">53</hi> At the same time that he promoted an agenda
                         developed in the earlier program, he coupled those interests with a larger
                         and better-funded national health program. Hurty described himself as a
                         strong supporter of the Sheppard-Towner Act for the improvement of maternal
                         and infant health.<hi rend="sup">54</hi> Although the state-based programs
                         were opposed by a number of national associations whose affiliates had
                         opposed the legislation as it was heard in Congress, Hurty was able to use
                         Sheppard-Towner funds to establish the Division of Infant and Child Hygiene
                         within his purview. The division, in turn, propagated Hurty&apos;s
                         perspective on health, culminating in the Baby Book and related
                         programs.</p>
                    <p>Not all of Hurty&apos;s ventures met with the success that his Baby Book did.
                         For example, during the same time period when the New Castle Courier
                         reported that Hurty &quot;gave his celebrated lectures on
                         &apos;Eugenics&apos; before over 200 men in the Knights of Pythias

                         be eliminated, other papers described a rather different reception.<hi

                         leaders of the early twentieth-century hygiene movement, Hurty used the
                         status and the seniority he had gained throughout a lifetime of work to
                         advocate for aims that were both controversial and beneficial. It must be
                         noted, however, that his decision to leave his long-standing office
                         followed the 1921 Indiana Supreme Court decision on sterilization
                         legislation. Thus, Hurty concluded his career as state health commissioner

                         secretary.</p>
                    <p>Hurty&apos;s resignation and his subsequent fitful, single term in the
                         Indiana House of Representatives did not end his attempts to influence.
                         Hurty wrote a column for the Indianapolis News and continued to teach
                         classes for state university health and medical programs. Hurty became a
                         trusted confident of Indiana Senator Albert J. Beveridge, who described him
                         as &quot;dear Hurty,&quot; whom he held in his &quot;heart of
                              hearts.&quot;<hi rend="sup">59</hi> The two shared a common interest
                         in reform issues—Beveridge was a significant supporter of federal food
                              regulation.<hi rend="sup">60</hi> The former senator regarded the
                         former state official as a man who understood Hoosiers, their values and
                         their reasoning. As Hurty&apos;s career wound down, Beveridge, who had
                         served from 1899 to 1911, began an effort to return to Congress. When
                         Beveridge prepared to launch an ultimately unsuccessful re-election
                         campaign in 1922, he found Hurty&apos;s insights essential. Beveridge
                         wrote, <quote rend="blockquote">I want very much to get your analysis of
                              the public psychology. Also, I want your views as to the lines along

                              Hurty. During the past year I have knocked about among the people
                              myself more than ever before in my life and I think I have a fairly
                              accurate line on the mass thought and feeling. But I want it confirmed
                              or corrected by your own observation, which I have found to be as true

                         a poem, &quot;The Fence or the Ambulance,&quot; listing Hurty as the

                    <p>Following his death, Hurty&apos;s career has been recounted, often in
                         hagiographic terms, by those who want to revive his memory as a 
                         courageous fighter for modern health practices. He has also been demonized,
                         albeit indirectly, for the most damaging aspects of his health reforms. A
                         meaningful assessment of his life and work depends on understanding both
                         the revolutionary and the regressive elements of his intentions, since both
                         were part of his outlook and aims. While the photographs that document his
                         life and his health programs are monochromatic, Hurty&apos;s colorful
                         record reflects a mix of informed and ill-considered judgments that he

                         sterilized by the state who are still liv- ing. It is impossible, even a
                         century later, to distance ourselves from the health reforms Hurty
                         generated, despite our twenty-first-century recognition that some of the
                         laws and policies he developed were neither egalitarian nor altruistic.
                         Hurty&apos;s reform work had a eugenic core, which, in keeping with late
                         nineteenth-century attitudes, saw the sick and the disabled as financial
                         burdens upon the state; prevention, and institutionalization when
                         prophylactic measures failed, framed his aims. Differences of era and
                         infrastructure alone do not account for the distinctive role that Hurty
                         played in the nascent public health movement. Recognizing the harm wrought
                         by Hurty&apos;s decisions involves awareness of the way his single-minded
                         pursuit of a common good limited his consideration of individuals&apos;
                         humanity. His errors have become plainly visible, while his strengths have
                         led to public policies that have become so normal as to go virtually

                         and economy, might in time be deemed impolitic? Which uses of state power
                         truly provide for the well-being of individuals and society? The work Hurty
                         advanced has shown that even policies predicated on the most recent
                         science are not without moral entailments. His life story reveals
                         consequences that his contemporaries considered as benign which are now
                         understood in a different light. History&apos;s iron pen, which
                         Hurty&apos;s colleagues trusted to compose his illustrious story, may be
                         blunted.</p>

                         <pb n="247" id="VAA4025-106-3-037"/> Ralston established the Indiana
                         Committee on Mental Defectives (ICMD). The ICMD first met on December 17,
                         1915, to determine a method by which they could learn &quot;what the
                         problem of mental defectives—including the epileptic, feeble-minded and
                         insane—is in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                                   reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>, what is being done
                         for them here and elsewhere, and in light of the best experience what
                         program can be suggested for this state.&quot;<hi rend="sup">3</hi> During
                         its ten-year existence, the committee organized and funded three
                         psychological surveys in which field workers assessed communities, schools,
                         and state institutions. The ICMD culminated their efforts by publishing
                         three reports—each titled <hi rend="i">Mental Defectives in Indiana</hi>
                        —in 1916, 1918-19, and 1922.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> While all of the reports
                         included recommendations for much-needed institutional space and upgraded
                         services, and by default the money to fund them, the shift in the tone of
                         the third report is somewhat surprising. Instead of the fear-induced
                         language found in the introductions to the first and second reports, the
                         third booklet&apos;s tone shifted from apocalyptic warning to one of
                         community responsibility, and the recommendations for change bear a more
                         humanitarian initiative. While the tone may have changed, the message
                         remained the same, no doubt due to the stewardship of the original
                         committee members (six of whom remained on the committee during its entire
                         existence from 1915 to 1925). Each report warned of the increasing numbers
                         of mental defectives potentially requiring accommodations in state
                         institutions and the need for additional ICMD county surveys. The third
                         report, however, described the need for &quot;ample facilities for
                         scientific treatment, education and employment&quot; in addition to
                         community clinics and family care <list type="footnotes">

                    <p>Although many of the individuals whose names appear on state and national
                         mental hygiene reports, such as Lewis M. Terman and Julia C. Lathrop,
                         should be recognizable to scholars in the fields of history, education, and
                         psychology, most of the field workers remain anonymous. The ironic aspect
                         of this anonymity is that the field workers did the majority of the work on
                         these surveys. Not only did they conduct the interviews, proctor the tests,
                         and complete the case research, but some workers also wrote the reports.
                         Edna R. Jatho, one field worker involved in the ICMD studies, developed
                         well-defined ideas about &quot;what <placeName><region type="state"

                         could do&quot; to help its most vulnerable citizens. By the early 1920s,
                         Jatho and her colleagues shifted the focus of report recommendations from
                         an emphasis on institutionalization of the mentally challenged to the
                         improvement of individuals&apos; lives.</p>
                    <p>The eugenics movement, which proposed to improve society by controlling human
                         heredity, influenced the nation&apos;s perspective on genetics and health
                         during the first three decades of the twentieth century. Professionals in
                         the fields of medicine, social services, mental hygiene, and correction
                         concluded that the etiology of most mental illness was hereditary. Even
                         before the rediscovery of Mendel&apos;s genetic work in 1900, scientists
                         and social reformers began researching the perceived hereditary nature of
                         human characteristics within impoverished, rural families. Many of these
                         nineteenth-century researchers believed improved social conditions would
                         trump such hereditary shortcomings. As the twentieth century began,
                         however, a dramatic change occurred in the perception of treating
                         hereditary dysfunction. Spurred by the burgeoning field of genetics, many
                         eugenicists believed human heredity was fixed. Some eugenicists even
                         suggested that people with poor heredity should be confined in state
                         institutions or sterilized. In <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                              reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>, a crest of public anxiety aided the
                         passage of the 1907 compulsory sterilization act, the first in the
                         nation.</p>
                    <p>The next year also brought a monumental step for eugenics, when Henry H.
                         Goddard published the first English version of the Binet-Simon Measuring
                         Scale of Intelligence. After studying the methods of classroom teachers and
                         institutional physicians, French psychologist Alfred Binet and psychiatrist
                         Theodore Simon developed the scale, which assessed children through a
                         series of cognitive tests. The Binet-Simon Scale became the model for
                         intelligence testing because it not only combined elements of teacher
                         pedagogy and scientific technique, but it also compared a child&apos;s
                         development with established norms for <pb n="250" id="VAA4025-106-3-040"/>
                         his or her specific age level.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> Although Binet maintained that the 
                         purpose of the test was for individual assessment only, Progressive-era 
                         institutional managers discovered in Binet-Simon a scientific justification for
                         societal control and efficiency.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> Exacerbating the eugenic panic, in 1914
                         Goddard published Feeblemindedness and its Consequences, which defined
                         feeblemindedness as a recessive trait difficult to predict. In 1917,
                         Harvard geneticist Edward East reiterated this concept of supposed mental
                         deficiency by stating that &quot;the &apos;real menace&apos; of the
                         feebleminded...lay in the mass of invisible carriers, which constituted
                         about 7 percent of the American population, or one in every 14

                         ripe for progressive reform. As citizens of a swing state with a

                         parties clash over contemporary social dilemmas. During the early years of
                         the twentieth century, as electoral success shifted from the Republican
                         Party (1896-1908) to the Democratic Party (1909-1917) and then back to the

                         decrease dependency scientifically, and to limit alcohol consumption.</p>
                    <p>The ICMD was not the state&apos;s first progressive initiative to address
                         these three concerns. In 1881, the General Assembly created the Indiana
                         State Board of Health; by 1915 it was ranked sixth nationally in program
                         efficiency by the American Medical Association.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>

                         compulsory sterilization law in 1907 in response to the perceived success
                         of Dr. Harry C. Sharp&apos;s use of the vasectomy on prison inmates.<hi

                         published reports. The 1916 report, however, alludes to the
                         committee&apos;s eugenic intentions, opining that, &quot;the number of
                         defectives increases, largely, as we are coming to know, through bad
                         heredity, syphilis, and drug habits, including alcoholism. The task before
                         the state is one not only of institutional care but of prevention.&quot;<hi

                         ICMD, examining the attitudes of its members is crucial. Dr. George S.

                         Dr. Amos W. Butler, secretary of the Indiana BSC, supported to varying
                         degrees compulsory sterilization. The potential of sterilization as a
                         solution was expressed by Dr. Charles P. Emerson: <quote rend="blockquote"
                              >Would it be wise to take one institution, for instance, that had

                              some time to wipe this out; it is not a question of feeble-mindedness
                              or of epilepsy or of the criminal, but it is all one problem.<hi

                         rehabilitate or segregate those diagnosed as mentally defective, the phrase
                         &quot;wipe this out&quot; seems excessively strong.</p>
                    <p>The resolutions of the ICMD reiterated these three concerns, especially
                         dependency. The committee prioritized the fiscal challenge of caring for
                         social dependents, stating, &quot;the problem of the mental defective is
                         one of our greatest social as well as financial burdens and is increasing
                         in importance and weight every year.&quot;<hi rend="sup">16</hi> Despite the political
                         influence of the ICMD, the rapid increase in state spending on public
                         health did not necessarily mean that money was provided to all institutions
                         in need of funding. According to the 1915 <hi rend="i">Annual Report for the Board of
                         State Charities</hi>, occupancy in existing institutions was above recommended
                         levels, however, funding remained static. Due to these fiscal shortcomings,
                         the ICMD decided the prevention of mental illness through public
                         education would be the most effective goal of the survey.<hi rend="sup">17</hi></p>
                    <p>Their next step was to determine a means by which to survey the state. In
                         order to do so, the ICMD consulted both national and state organizations to
                         evaluate the effectiveness of their techniques.<hi rend="sup">18</hi> The

                         with the ERO, established in 1910 by Charles Davenport. Field-worker
                         training, however, began in 1904 when Superintendent Edward R. Johnstone
                         began classes for teachers at the Training School at Vineland.<hi

                         expertise in both heredity and psychology. An excellent example of the
                         training, experiences, and attitudes of many of the field workers was Edna
                         R. Jatho, a <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2066398" reg="Vineland"

                         third of the ICMD&apos;s state surveys. She was also a prolific letter
                         writer; the majority of her correspondence with Butler, Estabrook, and
                         other survey workers now resides at the Indiana State Archives.</p>

                         Edna and her sister Bertha, in addition to taking in boarders. Edna
                         attended the Philadelphia Normal School, which prepared her to become an
                         elementary school teacher; she began teaching in 1906. According to two
                         short resumes written for job applications, Jatho taught &quot;regular
                         classes,&quot; incorrigible boys, and feebleminded and retarded children in

                         absence, Butler asked Jatho to fulfill her speaking engagement at the
                         Indiana Conference against Crime on July 30, 1918.<hi rend="sup">32</hi></p>
                    <p>Life as a field worker was challenging. Interviewing individuals outside the
                         county seat meant that the women lived in local hotels or boarding houses
                         and needed to find their own transportation. The roads were often
                         treacherous and the weather abysmal. ICMD field workers used local
                         resources to their advantage whenever possible. While surveying in
                                   <placeName><region type="county" key="tgn_2000560" reg="Warrick"
                                   >Warrick County</region></placeName>, Reeves described to Butler:
                              <quote rend="blockquote">the roads being almost impassible on account
                              of continued rains and it is extremely difficult to get any sort of

                              sorts....Today Miss Jatho and I make a trip with the local undertaker
                             —business with him not being urgent. If a funeral should transpire
                              however we may be obliged to borrow his old horse hearse out of the

                         humor likely eased the dismal environment. In a previous letter, Jatho
                         quipped that if the highway commissioner stood behind his roads, they would
                         not be in such bad shape.</p>

                         unforeseeable events. From September to November 1918, the Spanish

                         &quot;Today I was planning to write to you, knowing you would be wondering
                         about our work and the &apos;Flu,&apos;&quot; Jatho wrote to Butler,

                         &quot;work of science&quot;: &quot;We have been able to work after a
                         fashion, but not in the direct systematic way we had planned... we have to
                         work in &quot;spots&quot; instead of working in entire townships as we had

                    <p>Despite their hardships, Jatho reminded her correspondents that she perceived
                         her work to be purely scientific, not to mention eugenic. For their final

                              <p>Family report by field worker Jane Griffiths, March 1918. Like many
                                   of her colleagues, Griffiths reported on the poor conditions of
                                   her subjects with both detail and condescension. The

                    <p>These women were working from the mindset of the 1920s, however, not that of
                         the twenty-first century. Present-day psychologists or social workers would
                         attribute most of the challenges faced by isolated rural communities to a
                         broken economy and/or an inferior educational system. For field workers in
                         the early twentieth century, on the other hand, nature was still winning
                         the nature vs. nurture debate. The irony of field workers who began their
                         careers as teachers was that their specialized training often led them to
                         blame a person&apos;s poverty on heredity instead of on the influences of
                         societal forces often observed by teachers. Helen Reeves provides another
                         example of the innate challenges to understanding the juxtaposition of
                         early twentieth-century eugenic mental health rhetoric with the compassion
                         shown by psychologists, social workers, and case investigators.
                         Reeves&apos;s work for the Kentucky Institution for Feeble-Minded Children

                         Reeves&apos;s answer told of the fine line field workers walked between
                         compassion and pity: &quot;<placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"
                                   >Indiana</region></placeName> is attractive but there is not a state

                         seemingly harsh assessment of their subjects, the goal of these women was
                         the betterment of society.</p>
                    <p>After completing the reports for the second survey, Jatho returned to

                         further develop her career in psychology. The increasing number of
                         diagnoses of feeblemindedness demonstrated to many in the field that
                         additional psychological services were needed, especially since psychology
                         departments in hospitals were rare. Desiring to professionalize their
                         field, psychiatrists and psychologists began to establish clinics in order

                         clinic&apos;s psychiatric social worker for a little over two years. The

                         Farmington patients in exchange for psychological assessments of hospital
                         patients. Jatho managed many of the clinic&apos;s services including
                         initial psychiatric evaluations, intelligence and medical assessments, and
                         home visits. She would then refer a patient to the appropriate physician at
                         the clinic. In accounts of her time at Farmington, Jatho lists herself as
                         psychologist, psychiatric social worker, and office manager. If Jatho did
                         fulfill the responsibilities of all of those positions, she would have
                         gained extraordinary experience, since during its final year the clinic
                         encountered six hundred walk-in patients, in addition to patient
                         consultations through social workers, hospitals, schools, and
                              orphanages.<hi rend="sup">41</hi></p>

                         used by Dr. Ludlum to diagnose and treat intestinal anomalies associated
                         with mental difficulties in children. Each case study included a

                         correct the physical disorders accompanying the mental manifestations, and
                         the latter will then disappear.&quot;<hi rend="sup">43</hi> Once certain
                         intestinal birth defects were corrected, often the children&apos;s mental

                    <p>If Jatho&apos;s inclusion on this article demonstrates her influence on
                         Farmington, then the incorporation of the connection between physiology
                         and psychology included in the last ICMD survey report demonstrates
                         Farmington&apos;s influence on her. The first two ICMD surveys suggested
                         routine physical and mental assessment of school-age children; however,
                         the third survey report concluded that &quot;mental health in children is
                         closely connected with physical health,&quot; and recommended that
                         &quot;all children whose mental development is not normal should have
                         intensive study of their physical condition and follow-up care.&quot;<hi

                         These conclusions demonstrate the growing understanding of connections
                         between environment and mental health.</p>
                    <p>Jatho owed her involvement in the final Indiana survey to Farmington; several
                         months after receiving an invitation to participate in the trial court
                         clinic planned by the ICMD, the Philadelphia General Hospital absorbed the
                         Farmington Clinic, thus freeing Jatho to work through the entire third
                              survey.<hi rend="sup">45</hi> Her first assignment during the fall of
                         1921 included several court clinics in the Marion County Criminal and
                         Juvenile Courts and the Indianapolis City Court. During a three-month span,
                         Jatho evaluated seventy-four youths referred by court employees,
                         policewomen, and other individuals. Jatho administered the Terman version
                         of the Binet-Simon test, discussed youths with current or previous case
                         workers or social workers, and in some cases conducted the complete
                         fieldwork assessment herself. Her final report, given to the ICMD in
                         December 1921, and published almost in its entirety in the 1922 ICMD
                         report, indicates Jatho&apos;s perspective on evaluative psychiatric

                         workers for previous surveys had administered intelligence tests to some
                         local children; however, the results provided in the 1916 and 1918-19
                         reports appeared as statistical data only. For the third survey, the ICMD
                         decided that a comprehensive school study would be more informative. In the
                         &quot;Purpose of the Survey&quot; section of the 1922 ICMD report, Jatho
                         and Nash state that &quot;no surveys have been made in public schools prior

                         presented simple pictures in groups. Test proctors asked students to choose

                         Mental Survey Scale No. 1, or Schedule D, asked students to consider a set
                         of words and cross out the word that did not belong. The third test was the

                                   reg="Richmond">Richmond</settlement></placeName> survey. Nash and
                         Jatho arrived on December 2, 1921, with the goal of administering group
                         tests to all of the students and individual tests to students chosen by
                         their teachers as performing substantially below grade level. In
                                   <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7014336"
                                   reg="Richmond">Richmond</settlement></placeName>, out of 3,800
                         students, 3,505 took group tests. According to the survey report, children
                         in grades K-3 took the Primer Test and students in grades 4-9 took Schedule
                         D. The report, however, does not always include the details of the survey
                         process. In a letter responding to Estabrook&apos;s concern over the amount
                         of time being spent in <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7014336"
                                   reg="Richmond">Richmond</settlement></placeName>, Jatho reminded
                         him that they were giving both the Primer and Schedule D tests to grades 4,
                         5, and 6 creating &quot;almost 50% more tests than there are grades&quot;
                         to score.<hi rend="sup">50</hi></p>
                    <p>Estabrook demonstrated high expectations regarding the speed with which the
                         project should be finished. In response to Jatho&apos;s suggestion that
                         she and Nash utilize high school students to help score the 42 class sets
                         of Schedule D test blanks, Estabrook responded: &quot; [G]et five or six
                         high school girls on Saturday and stay with them all day and [if] one or
                         both of you supervise the crowd it will be perfectly satisfactory. Working
                         Saturday would mean that none of them would be interfered with in their
                         school work.&quot;<hi rend="sup">51</hi> Estabrook rarely mentioned concern for the
                         amount of time Jatho and Nash were expected to commit to the project. A
                         ten- to twelve-hour Saturday most likely erased any time the 
                         investigators had planned for other aspects of the project, thus demanding
                         additional time to complete those tasks. Anxiety about Estabrook&apos;s
                         expectations appears in several of Jatho&apos;s letters. On December 18 she

                    <p>In the face of Estabrook&apos;s expectations, Jatho often held her ground by
                         defending her perspective of the survey process. Estabrook suggested
                         sending test forms to the ICMD office so that the staff could help score
                         them. &quot;The office force would not find the scoring of the papers as
                         simple a matter as it seems,&quot; Jatho suggested. &quot;[T]he marks are
                         low enough as it is even with our understanding of the children and the
                         circumstances surrounding the tests and if they were marked arbitrarily as
                         they would have to be by outsiders the scores would not compare fairly with
                         those on the papers scored by us.&quot;<hi rend="sup">53</hi> Jatho
                         convinced Estabrook to allow more time for the <placeName><settlement

                         remained until the end of March. In other matters Estabrook won: The tests
                         were scored in the home office.</p>
                    <p>In addition to scoring, writing reports, and corresponding with Estabrook,
                         Jatho spoke frequently at public functions. Several influential
                         organizations featured her as a speaker, including the Indiana Academy of
                         Science, the Indiana State Teachers&apos; Association, and the Indiana
                         Conference on Mental Hygiene. Jatho mentioned at least four speaking
                         engagements between December 1921 and February 1922, including an address

                         experience the time constraints placed on these women. The field of
                         psychology was becoming professionalized for both genders; however, women

                    <p>Other than a brief mention in the introduction to the surveys, the ICMD did
                         not credit any interpretive work to its field workers. A closer examination
                         of the three volumes of <hi rend="i">Mental Defectives in Indiana</hi>,
                         however, provides proof of the field workers&apos; input. The 1916 report
                         attributes the data gathering to the field workers, without their names.
                         The 1918-19 report provides the field workers&apos; names, and according to
                         a letter from Jatho to Butler&apos;s secretary, the section titled
                         &quot;What <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"
                                   >Indiana</region></placeName> Can Do&quot; can be attributed to
                         Jatho. The third report is the most telling because it includes the names
                         of the field workers and attributes all of the information beyond the
                         introduction and recommendations to the field workers. The committee
                         minutes verify that the report on the court studies which Jatho gave to the
                         ICMD on December 14, 1921, is verbatim to the report in the 1922 <hi

                         report also clearly demonstrates a shift in priorities from
                         institutionalization to community care, which corresponds to the attitudes
                         of the field workers. For example, in the court studies, Jatho found that
                         32 percent of individuals tested as feebleminded, although she warned that
                         feebleminded children were often misdiagnosed, their
                         &quot;retardation...due to causes which could have been remedied, or which,
                         if not remedied, must be taken into consideration as factors in bringing
                         about a condi- tion which resembles congenital mental defect.&quot;<hi

                         reports, the justifications and recom- mendations illustrate the influence
                         of the ICMD field workers.</p> 
                    <p>Statements of the field workers&apos; concern for the people diagnosed as
                         feebleminded appear as early as the first report, which is not surpris- ing
                         considering the amount of time and energy Jatho and her colleagues
                         committed to the surveys. As the introduction illuminates &quot;The

                         usefulness.&quot;<hi rend="sup">61</hi> Education continues to be a priority as
                         teacher and facility shortcomings are highlighted, followed by
                         recommendations which request &quot;mental as well as physical examination
                         of school children.&quot;<hi rend="sup">62</hi> The connection between institutional care and
                         education of the mentally challenged obviously resides in the minds of the
                         committee; however, the immediate needs of their institutions take
                         precedence. In the final twelve recommendations of the 1916 report, ten
                         request additional services, improved facilities, or commitment
                         legislation.<hi rend="sup">63</hi></p>
                    <p>Education and care emerge as more important topics in the 1918-19 report.
                         The tone of the data and inclusion of more case studies demonstrate the
                         influence of the investigators. Field workers give descriptions and data
                         from ten counties, detailing the ways in which industry, fertile soil, and
                         transportation, or lack thereof, affected the local population. The women
                         evaluated several counties based on the schools and on environmental
                         factors including alcohol consumption. The tone of their descriptions
                         indicates their acknowledgement of the role of environmental factors in
                         mental and physical health.</p> 
                    <p>The final report, published in July 1922, strongly demonstrates the influence
                         of the field workers. From the foreword through the recommendations, the
                         tone and the included data reveal a new perspective on mental health care:
                         &quot;Many of these mental defectives, if recognized in the early stages,
                         rightly trained and supervised, may become orderly, self-respecting members
                         of society.&quot;<hi rend="sup">64</hi> In the third report only five of the final sixteen
                         recommendations request services, facilities, or legislation. These
                         requests, however, also iterate the need for curative and educational
                         tools, defined as &quot;scientific treatment, education, and
                         employmentment.&quot;<hi rend="sup">65</hi> 
                         Also, the recommendations reiterate &quot;the fact that care
                         and provision for the feebleminded must be divided between the home or
                         community, the public school and state institutions.&quot;<hi rend="sup">66</hi></p>

                    <p>The sections of the report which best illustrate change are Jatho&apos;s
                         &quot;Court Studies&quot; and &quot;School Studies.&quot; For the school
                         study, the report includes intelligence test scores, percentile rankings by
                         age, school comparisons by age percentile scores, percentile rankings by
                         grade, and general diagnoses of individually evaluated students. Jatho
                         emphasized her belief that environmental factors played a role in
                         intelligence by including &quot;[c]harts and graphs to show comparisons
                         between different sections of the city&quot; in order to demonstrate
                         &quot;the relation between the social and economic status of these
                         community groups, and the intelligence levels of the children from such
                         communities.&quot;<hi rend="sup">67</hi> Jatho praised the Richmond Social Service Bureau for
                         providing &quot;shower baths for the boys and girls, cooking and sewing
                         classes for the mothers and reading and other clubs for
                         parents.&quot;<hi rend="sup">68</hi></p> 
                    <p>The recommendations to the schools are mainly positive except for
                         Jatho&apos;s suggestion that feebleminded students &quot;detract from the
                         value of a regular class to the normal members.&quot; Her suggestions for
                         special classes, however, are forward-thinking for the time, recommending
                         four different types of classes. First, a &quot;coaching and
                         observation&quot; class for students effected by &quot;disease or
                         environment&quot; could assuage the environmental and physical
                         difficulties so that these children &quot;could be reclaimed and returned
                         to the regular grades.&quot; Second, a training class &quot;for the mental
                         development of those known to be defective&quot; could enhance mental
                         development in children diagnosed as feebleminded. Third, Jatho suggests
                         classes that provide &quot;permanent provisions for certain selected
                         children along trade or occupational lines.&quot;<hi rend="sup">69</hi> Children in this class
                         would learn, in addition to life skills such as sewing, trade skills from a
                         teacher &quot;well trained...in Manual Arts and Woodworking.&quot; In
                         addition, this teacher should be &quot;very ingenious in keeping the 
                         interest of the child,&quot; providing a variety of tasks and projects to
                         increase their &quot;mental development.&quot;<hi rend="sup">70</hi> Jatho&apos;s fourth
                         suggestion was a program for students who test at superior levels of
                         intelligence. In order to avoid leaving advanced children with
                         &quot;undirected mental energy,&quot; Jatho suggests that teachers of
                         these students provide &quot;special educational  <list type="footnotes">

                         suggestions for special education demonstrate two growing trends of thought
                         during the 1920s. Although society still identified people diagnosed with
                         mental illness as a burden, educators increasingly believed that when
                         adequately trained, these individuals could play a productive role in
                         society. They also thought that when students were engaged through
                         pedagogy appropriate for their knowledge level and life experience, they
                         could thrive.</p> 
                    <p>The Indiana Committee on Mental Defectives represents the extreme influence
                         of eugenic thought during the Progressive Era. Interpreting the
                         group&apos;s overall support for human betterment based on the
                         committee&apos;s records and reports is complicated, because the 
                         priorities of the ICMD members often differed from those of the women 
                         conducting research. Field workers successfully fueled the flame of eugenics
                         and at the same time doused it. Their pedigree charts and harsh language
                         suggest eugenic intentions in their work; however, when placed in the
                         context of the growing fields of psychology and education in the early
                         decades of the twentieth century, the field workers&apos; views on
                         eugenics, heredity, and mental health demonstrate a shift in the concept of
                         human betterment, from one of removing mentally challenged individuals
                         from society to one of improving the lives of these individuals within
                         society. These women&apos;s influence on the ICMD rises above any
                         ideological changes connected to new committee members. The data these
                         field workers provided encouraged deeper investigation of the effect of the
                         environment and education on mental health. They also insisted on adequate
                         time to complete surveys in order to assess survey participants thoroughly.
                         Beyond the surveys themselves, the women field workers understood that the
                         causes of mental illness extended beyond heredity to include social forces
                         such as poverty. Although the shift from heredity to more complicated
                         causation of mental illness did not end the eugenic movement to race
                         betterment, it did signal a reassessment of care for people with mental
                         illness.<hi rend="sup">72</hi></p>

                    <p>At the twentieth annual state conference of the Indiana State Board of
                         Charities and Correction, J. W. Sale, a prominent member of the board of
                         trustees for the Indiana School for Feebleminded Youth, sounded a strong
                         alarm to the state regarding its &quot;defective citizens.&quot; Sale
                         asserted with confidence that the condition of
                         &quot;feeble-mindedness&quot; was largely inherited, that it was
                         &quot;incurable,&quot; and that without proper attention it would become
                         &quot;a tremendous burden of expense to every community.&quot; He then
                         argued that if &quot;defectives&quot; in <placeName><region type="state"

                         thought to an audience of like-minded reformers committed to improving

                         political and medical leadership considered eugenics a primary weapon in
                         its war against social pathology, one to be used in concert by state
                         institutions, local governments, public schools, and various social

                         &quot;inferior&quot; members of its population. Sale&apos;s comments
                         clearly reflected the then-current belief that a eugenic-based approach to
                         social melioration was both right and necessary: the terminology, the
                         alarmist tone, and the vision of a brighter future that would be free from
                         the intractable problems caused by corruptive breeding and inferior stock,
                         all represented the essence of a worldview framed by a eugenic perspective.
                         As a fundamental tenet of many Progressive-era visions of social
                         improvement, eugenics became imbedded in much of the discourse of the
                         reform movements that characterized Indiana and the nation during the early
                         twentieth century.</p> 
                    <p>One of the arenas in which eugenics had a strong impact was public
                         education. From 1900 to 1930 public education systems in the
                         <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">United States</country></placeName>
                         were shaped profoundly by Progressive-era concerns with science,
                         classification, and human betterment. This was a crucial period not only
                         for the development of public education in the nation, but also for the
                         advancement of eugenics as a factor in the development of social policy.
                         This concurrence assured that public schools would be effected
                         significantly by eugenic thought and practice. According to historian
                         Steven Selden, advocates of eugenics represented a self-appointed elite
                         group of individuals drawn from fields of medicine, public health, 
                         education, science, psychology, sociology, and politics. Many of these 
                         individuals, in turn, contributed ideas and perspectives that proved crucial to
                         public education&apos;s adaptations of eugenic principles. Given that 
                         public schools had long been considered essential vehicles for addressing
                         civic and moral issues, as well as solving social problems, it is no 
                         surprise that they became central features of efforts to advocate and 
                         implement eugenic-based policy throughout the <placeName><country

                                   first three decades of the twentieth century, public education
                                   was &quot;shaped profoundly&quot; by scientific theories,
                                   including eugenics.</p>

                         education: in part because schools had long been agents for social
                         progress, and in part because their emphasis on social selection,
                         differentiation, stratification, and preparation of most, if not all,
                         elements of the population rendered them natural allies in eugenics&apos;

                         in the Progressive Era, the sweeping movement that dominated American
                         society during this period.<hi rend="sup">2</hi></p>

                         these powerful emergent forces in science and education. Indeed, in the
                         early twentieth century, many prominent educators eagerly embraced ideas
                         about the promise and limits of education based on eugenic principles of
                         hereditary fitness and race improvement. It is difficult to understand
                         completely the development of mental testing, curriculum tracking, and
                         special education in the state without grasping the role of eugenics during
                         this period. This essay explores public education in <placeName><region

                         first time, the extent to which these ideas informed patterns of pedagogy,
                         student stratification and placement, and most importantly, the narratives
                         and policy statements of school professionals in the state. The article
                         focuses on three specific aspects of this landscape: the public language of
                         public education, the rise of mental testing and other modes of student
                         assessment, and the development of special programs for educating students
                         identified as gifted. It demonstrates that <placeName><region type="state"

                         concerns and claims raised by those advocates. Consequently, schools in the
                         state provide a fertile ground for exploring more specific relations
                         between eugenics and school policy and practice.</p>

                         followed paths similar to those in other midwestern states, but also
                         experienced some unique turns. The original state constitution of 1816
                         addressed education only in the broadest of terms, consequently, regional
                         differences led to serious disagreements among the populace and elected
                         legislators about the necessity and appropriateness of state involvement in
                         developing common schools and supporting them through state taxes.
                         Eventually the 1816 constitution was deemed inadequate, and another
                         constitution was written and adopted in 1851. Largely through the advocacy
                         and persuasive rhetoric of Caleb Mills, then president of Wabash College,
                         the new constitution established a state-authorized school system. A state
                         superintendent of public instruction was installed in 1852, soon followed
                         by a state board of education. However, resistance to tax-supported schools
                         persisted for two decades, inhibiting the development of a statewide public
                         school structure that could be more readily found in the neighboring states

                         In addition, local districts continued to provide their own programs on an
                         as-needed basis, either via informal institutes or through departments in
                         traditional private or public colleges. By the early 1900s, however,
                         standardized teacher credentialing had become a much more important issue:
                         public school enrollment had increased dramatically, and states took a much
                         closer interest in the quality of the teachers found in public school
                         classrooms. A second state-supported teacher training institution opened in

                         the 1920s. The state became much more actively involved in not only
                         training teachers but also setting credentialing requirements. Furthermore,
                         training for special education began to take hold in the 1920s, either
                         through the state teacher training institutions or through workshops and

                         state&apos;s demographic composition in terms of ancestral origin, wealth,
                         home life, and ability to perform in school. The state was overwhelmingly
                         white in racial origin; this population had emigrated from wealthier and
                         more established New England, as well from some of the poorest areas of
                         Appalachia. Consequently, the range of socio-economic status in the state
                         was quite wide. African Americans constituted a small portion of
                         Indiana&apos;s populace. They were concentrated in the major metropolitan

                         prohibited enrollment of students deemed unfit to receive school
                         instruction, the annual state superintendent reports saw a dramatic

                         ignorant of the fundamentals of good government.&quot; The 1924 report gave
                         an indication of the scope of the investment to that point: out of a total
                         of 614,212 elementary and secondary school students in <placeName><region type="state"

                         institutionalization for persons identified as feebleminded. Amos Butler

                         Mental Defectives (ICMD). This group, formed by Governor Samuel Ralston in
                         1915, and funded by Ralston and two succeeding governors until 1925,
                         sponsored sweeping field research projects designed to determine the nature
                         and extent of feeblemindedness in the state and develop policies to reduce,
                         and ultimately eradicate, the condition. Many of the ERO&apos;s

                         national origin and immigrant status than on the concept of race as a
                         biological construct. While the term &quot;race&quot; was used extensively
                         throughout the <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States"

                         eugenics coincided as much with what we today would term ethnicity or
                         national heritage, as with fundamental genetic racial distinctions among
                         humans. As noted earlier, the state&apos;s number of African American
                         residents during the early 1900s was quite small, with most living in
                         segregated sectors of the largest cities. In contrast, the political and
                         educational leaders of the state responded knowingly to the pervasive
                         anti-immigrant sentiments of the early twentieth century. Fueled largely by
                         H. H. Goddard&apos;s determinations that most immigrants coming through
                         Ellis Island were &quot;moron&quot; grade or lower in terms of intellect,
                         such sentiments translated into direct condemnation of whites who relocated

                         classes for defectives in its schools. However, the vast majority of these
                         children were ethnic whites, and discussions of defective children in
                         schools rarely if ever made note of whether a child was white or black.<hi

                    <p>The state focused on the importance of the medical and intellectual
                         inspection of all children as well as the need for all public social

                         and their families to promote social efficiency and a eugenic philosophy.

                         initiatives. In each of its three major reports-issued in 1916, 1918-19,
                         and 1922-the ICMD addressed the importance of public education in improving

                         analyzed the number of feebleminded children, described the structures to
                         accommodate them, and offered recommendations for further action. State
                         conferences, such as those of the Indiana State Teachers Association,
                         featured state school officials as well as speakers with national

                         <p>As acknowledged and established agents of social policy, public schools
                              in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"
                                        >Indiana</region></placeName> offered a regular stream of
                              published policy statements, regulations, and explications whose
                              terminology and assumptions reflected the dominant strain of eugenic
                              thought in the early 1900s. Of course, determining what constitutes
                              the language of eugenics is a highly complex task, one well beyond the
                              scope of this particular essay and discussed most competently by other
                              scholars. Nevertheless, those involved in public education employed
                              language that was often found in more general studies and discussions
                              of eugenics. While not obviously distinguishable from the language of
                              Progressivism, such terms—and the school contexts in which they
                              regularly appeared—clearly drew on significant elements of eugenic
                              thought and practice.</p> 
                         <p>In <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"
                                        >Indiana</region></placeName>, the connective networks among
                              state-operated agencies meant that certain common theories regarding
                              societal conditions and social development affected policy in a wide
                              array of social services, including schools and other formal
                              educational settings. Consequently, statements of leaders such as
                              Butler, Bliss, and Johnson—often expressed through conference
                              addresses or formal statements of organizations such as the
                              BSC—reflected prevailing attitudes of most of those involved in
                              delivering social services. When Butler pronounced that &quot;[a]s
                              each agency takes up the work with boys or girls, or men or women, it
                              recognizes that feeble-mindedness is one of the great causes of
                              pauperism, vice, immorality, crime, degeneracy, and that it is an
                              increasing cause .... the feeble-minded population [is] increasing at
                              practically twice the rate of the normal population,&quot; few
                              questioned the accuracy or authority of his assertion. When Bliss
                              pointedly stated, &quot;I should be faithless to my duty did I not
                              point out to you the great menace to this state, of leaving the 4,500
                              feeble-minded, now at large in our communities, to their own devices,
                              to marry and reproduce their kind, to fill the police courts of our
                              larger towns and cities, to augment the supply of prostitutes and
                              paupers, as well as the other forms of vice to which a degenerate will
                              surely turn,&quot; his alarm was considered reasonable and noteworthy.
                              When Johnson claimed that &quot;[i]t is known, with certainty, that of
                              all physical or mental traits which are passed down by heredity from
                              parent to child, these peculiar traits which we call idiocy and
                              imbecility, are the most certain to be inherited. Think then what we
                              are doing when we are neglecting these poor creatures. We are allowing
                              a steady increase of a most undesirable class of citizens; we are
                              building <pb n="283" id="VAA4025-106-3-073"/> up the burden which our
                              children must bear,&quot; the apparent need for social institutions to
                              recognize and address the hereditary dangers of mental disability
                              demanded little if any extra incentive to do just that.<hi rend="sup"

                              reflected this dominant ideology. Reports of the BSC in 1916 and 1920
                              emphasized the fixed, inherited nature of mental defect and toed the
                              eugenic line regarding its impact on society: &quot;It is from these
                              unfortu- nates that the ranks of pauperism and vice and crime are
                              chiefly recruited . . . feeble-mindedness complicates every form of

                              1916 report. &quot;We . . . know that moral and mental characteristics
                              are inherited and behave exactly like physical characters,&quot; wrote

                              and elsewhere eventually did assume a large share of responsibility
                              for addressing the presence of inferior stock in general, and
                              feeble-mindedness in particular. For many, the idea of placing
                              inferior children in public school settings proved highly appealing.
                              In special classes taught by specially trained teachers and using a
                              specially designed curriculum, such children could make significant

                              University in 1924. Ultimately, according to John Brown, secretary of

                              various defects or deficiencies. Rationales emphasizing social

                         <p>The Progressive Era embraced not only much of the substance of eugenic
                              thought, but also notions of objective and scientific approaches to
                              addressing individual and social issues-and alleged pathologies. The
                              multifaceted public attack on social ills involved schools, hospitals,
                              social service agencies, benevolent institutions, and limited local
                              government working to identify problems and apply the best
                              scientific principles and practices to determine appropriate
                              solutions. As a respected manifestation of presumed scientific thought
                              and investigation, eugenics validated the concept of examining
                              individuals in detail—their character, background, and demeanor—in
                              order to ascertain their appropriate role in a modern, efficient
                              society. And as a cornerstone of the execution of social policy,
                              public schools naturally became centers of such individual and group
                              examinations. These included mental testing as well as medical and
                              psychological assessments of children at schools or available clinics.
                              The role of the school as a center for comprehensive child assessment,
                              and of the clinic as a means to expand such testing to reach more
                              children, constituted another eugenically influenced arena of social

                              established elsewhere across the country: initial use of individual
                              Binet-Simon tests on selected students beginning in the latter 1910s,
                              followed by rapid expansion to large-scale group intelligence testing
                              involving hundreds of thousands of American schoolchildren every year
                              beginning in the early 1920s. Such testing gained wide advocacy and
                              use because it was openly promoted and accepted as a valid, reliable
                              means of slotting students into appropriate classrooms and programs,
                              thus facilitating the schools&apos; function as a sorter and trainer
                              of <pb n="287" id="VAA4025-106-3-077"/> children. In addition,
                              according to proponents of eugenics, the scientific objectivity of the
                              IQ score reinforced notions of the hereditary and fixed nature of
                              intelligence, and validated direct social control over inferior groups
                              such as African Americans and immigrants from southern and eastern
                              regions of Europe. For example, Jane Griffiths, an official with the
                              Utah State Department of Education, gave a 1917 speech before the
                              Indiana State Teachers Association in which she advocated extensive
                              mental testing of all American public school children. Five years
                              later, Arthur Estabrook of the ERO described the extensive use of

                              because they brought resources, expertise, and tests to school
                              districts and communities that otherwise would not have been able to
                              engage in screenings of children and families. Data gathered by
                              clinics could be provided to the schools, so that the latter would not
                              have to invest their often limited resources on this expensive work.
                              In cases where clinic staffers also worked for the schools, the
                              sharing of resources likely became more valuable to the districts.
                              With the clinics offering assessments, and the schools doing further
                              testing and follow up—such as tracking students according to test
                              results—societal efforts to assess, monitor, and mold as many children
                              as possible for purposes of improvement took a more formal and
                              predictable path. This complementary work exemplified a relatively
                              effective—if limited—effort to coordinate an array of social services

                              had some form of special education for children with disabilities,
                              particularly those with mental retardation, chronic illness, physical
                              limitations, or behavioral problems. One mode of specialized
                              instruction that did not receive as much attention, in terms of the
                              number of students and programs in schools, was that for children
                              identified as superior or gifted. Ironically, in the stratified world
                              of public schooling little room had been made at the top for the
                              state&apos;s brightest children who represented the best that the
                              American &quot;race&quot; had to offer. In fact, the notion of a
                              specialized gifted education started slowly throughout the
                                        <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States"

                              accelerated with the widespread use of group intelligence testing and
                              with the belief that society needed to identify and nurture its future
                              leaders. Although <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"

                              noteworthy programs in gifted education before 1930, a review of the
                              national picture during the 1920s places state efforts in the context
                              of eugenic thought and school practice.</p> 
                         <p>While much of eugenic ideology had been applied to pathological
                              conditions, these ideas and principles also advanced the cause of
                              superior groups of people. Positive eugenics&apos; emphasis on
                              arranging human genetics to improve society through careful
                              identification and breeding of the nation&apos;s strongest, most
                              vigorous, and most talented clearly exemplified this aspect of the
                              field. Consequently, eugenicists put a great deal of energy into
                              researching and discussing the hereditary nature of intelligence and
                              the ways in which the precious national resource of smart, talented
                              citizens could best be utilized. The work, and intellectual lineage,
                              of Francis Galton, E. L. Thorndike, H. H. Goddard, Lewis Terman, and
                              Leta Hollingworth underscored this concern. All advocated thinking
                              about ways in which the superior elements of society could best be
                              harnessed in the causes of race betterment and social improvement.
                              All viewed intelligence as an inborn trait, with the brightest minds
                              almost always coming from—and staying within—the best families. And
                              all proposed various means of convincing these superior societal 
                              members to accept their role at the top and serve society by reproducing
                              at greater rates. These methods ranged from public exhortation to
                              offers of significant financial incentives for producing more
                              children. Supporting and incentivizing society&apos;s finest to
                              reproduce more frequently and claim their right to a privileged social
                              position became, to some eugenicists, as <pb n="293"
                                   id="VAA4025-106-3-083"/> important as earlier efforts to
                              identify, isolate, and eventually extinguish those on the opposite end
                              of the societal spectrum.<hi rend="sup">19</hi></p> 
                         <p>These particular eugenic priorities were perhaps most strongly and
                              unapologetically articulated by Hollingworth. A student of Thorndike
                              and a faculty member at Teachers College of Columbia University,
                              Hollingworth wrote a highly regarded text entitled <hi rend="i">Gifted Children:
                              Their Nature and Nurture</hi>. Published in 1926, the volume focused on
                              methods of educating gifted children but was infused with the language
                              of eugenics. Hollingworth saw little value in directing social
                              policy and precious resources toward efforts to improve the inferior
                              ranks of society, including the mentally disabled, the criminal, the
                              destitute—those whom she referred to as &quot;biologically unfortunate
                              and socially undesirable deviates.&quot; Instead, she argued that
                              American society should use its resources to strengthen those at the
                              top of the social realm who, because of heredity, were able to
                              benefit from intervention on their behalf. Hollingworth&apos;s
                              conviction that ethnicity was a highly reliable predictor of innate
                              intelligence and social abilities led her to openly question social
                              programs, including those of the public schools, designed to improve
                              the conditions of the lesser elements of society. She believed that
                              public support for special education programs for defective children
                              was a waste and that school resources would be better distributed to
                              the brightest children in school, leading to greater long-term
                              return on investments. Much of her language and argument reveals an
                              open disdain for certain groups of individuals, as well as an
                              entrenched frustration at society&apos;s failure to recognize the role
                              the highest classes could and should play in social improvement.<hi

                         <p>From a school perspective, Hollingworth&apos;s frustrations were 
                              understandable. Historically, children considered to be among the brightest
                              in school had enjoyed few efforts to recognize their talents and
                              provide special opportunities for their development. By the 1920s, a
                              few cities had experimented with special classes or programs for
                              children identified as gifted, with <placeName><settlement type="city"

                              use. However, such endeavors were limited at best. In 1930, there were
                              forty cities in twenty-three states offering about 150 programs, with
                              just 4,000 students enrolled—a miniscule number compared to the
                              hundreds of thousands then enrolled in special classes for mentally or
                              physically disabled children, and compared to the estimated 1,500,000
                              who were deemed qualified for gifted programs.<hi rend="sup">21</hi></p>

                              in the area of gifted education before the late 1920s. The state had
                              invested far more educational resources in students with various
                              disabilities than in those identified as having superior qualities.

                              1950s. Even with the advent of group intelligence testing in the
                              1920s, those scores were used almost exclusively to identify children
                              with mental disability. In 1923, State Senator C. O. Holmes, a member
                              of the ICMD, echoed Hollingworth when he lamented the lack of concern
                              paid to &quot;that small percentage of unusually qualified mentally,
                              from which comes the greater portion of our leadership.&quot; Holmes
                              argued that &quot;we are not now affording that special care and
                              attention&quot; to gifted children. A 1927 article in the <hi rend="i"

                              specifically targeted students who had been identified as
                              &quot;retardates&quot;-students doing academic work at well below
                              their assumed capabilities based on IQ scores. Approximately
                              twenty-five students were selected &quot;very carefully&quot; based on
                              measured IQ (greater than 120), teacher recommendations, social
                              behavior in school, and home environment. To some extent the
                              curriculum reflected Hollingworth&apos;s beliefs that a class for
                              gifted children needed to incorporate freedom, richness in resources,
                              attention to individual needs and interests, and opportunities for
                              collaborative work and leadership experience among the students.
                              Weekly entries were made in a child&apos;s file regarding her or his
                              accomplishments, attitude, ability to work well with other students,
                              and even her or his peculiarities. DuShane claimed that students who
                              previously had been &quot;disciplinary problems&quot; or &quot;not
                              taxed to their ability&quot; or &quot;full of energy unconfined&quot;
                              found a successful home in the school. He claimed they developed a
                              strong sense of community, found an environment rich in resources
                              &quot;for their interests and enthusiasms,&quot; and benefited greatly
                              from individualized instruction that circumvented the
                              &quot;lock-step&quot; of the traditional school curriculum. He also
                              asserted that students from this first group were now in high school,
                              some &quot;at a very early age,&quot; and almost all were doing

                              others. DuShane was no stranger to such rhetoric, having used it to
                              describe the function of modern schools in general. Yet with regard to

                              helping them to achieve their potential as students. &quot;The upper

                              organized do not stimulate this group to its greatest activity...then
                              the schools have failed greatly.&quot; By 1930, it was estimated that
                              6 percent of all school students nationwide could be classified as
                              gifted, or 1,500,000 out of more than 25 million schoolchildren. With
                              only a few thousand American students enrolled in programs for gifted
                              children, it was apparent that <placeName><region type="state"

                         <p>The lack of initiative prior to the 1930s regarding the creation of
                              programs for children identified as gifted was indeed a national
                              story. Although there existed a significant awareness of the
                              possibilities for such programs, most differentiated instruction
                              focused on inferior children because, as Holmes indicated, that group
                              was seen as &quot;the immediate problem .. . with all of the
                              difficulties, menace, and increasing deterioration of the stream of
                              life from the infusing of an ever-enlarging proportion of these mental
                              defectives.&quot; The alarmist overtones of negative eugenics
                              dominated social and political discourse—in <placeName><region

                              Progressive Era, with its emphasis on social pathology and reformist
                              corrective action in response to unsettling, widespread conditions.
                              Hollingworth&apos;s appeal to positive eugenics as a rationale for
                              more intensive development of school programs for superior children
                              found an audience among her academic peers such as Terman. However,
                              she did not attract sufficient attention from pragmatic,
                              problem-oriented school officials who faced enormous pressures from
                              both politicians and the public to operate schools efficiently and
                              inexpensively, while also addressing the ubiquitous menace of inferior
                              and uncooperative schoolchildren. Furthermore, objectively identifying
                              unusually intelligent children depended significantly on the use of
                              standardized group intelligence tests, whereas those who were
                              considered defective were more readily obvious-for physical and

                              simultaneously reinforcing the entrenchment of all that was best about

                              this arena served as models for other states requires more extensive
                              research on specific developments elsewhere.</p> 
                         <p>Indeed, any real influence of eugenics on public school operation
                              remains masked. The intellectual and social ferment of the early 1900s
                              covered a broad landscape of political, social, philosophical,
                              medical, and even theological worldviews that often overlapped and
                              borrowed extensively from each other. As the umbrella under which most
                              of these efforts took place, Progressivism was itself a complex set of
                              overlapping and at times contradictory views and assumptions. This was
                              nowhere more apparent than in the world of education, where examples
                              of eugenic language and practice intermingled with those of
                              experiential education, behavioral and developmental psychology,
                              business and factory models of schooling, social Darwinism, and
                              curricular tracks and programs that ranged from the classical to the
                              vocational. Each of these theories of, or approaches to, the education
                              of children in schools boasted their own principles, narratives,
                              perspectives, advocates, and terminology—but the primary goals were
                              self-advancement and public acceptance. Many of these theories found
                              common ground with eugenics, some more so than others. But to draw a
                              single, direct line of impact from broad educational policies based on
                              a science of human reproductive engineering to actual practices in
                              school buildings and classrooms is impossible. The field of eugenics
                              exhibits a remarkable complexity: it is a complicated, contradictory
                              body of influences, beliefs, and practices, crafted by people with
                              multiple agendas and perspectives.</p> 
                         <p>Public schools are fundamentally practical places: although theory and
                              philosophy are by no means ignored, the value of any school
                              initiative, regulation, program, or practice is most rigorously
                              measured in its day-to-day success. While certainly aware of public
                              interest in eugenics, school leaders in <placeName><region

                                        >Indiana</region></placeName> ultimately argued in favor of,
                              or against, <pb n="299" id="VAA4025-106-3-089"/> certain policies and
                              practices based on whether they would work in the schools. Features
                              such as curriculum and student tracking, special education for
                              students with disabilities, vocational education, health education
                              (including mental hygiene), large-scale mental testing, and education
                              for superior children could claim some of their inspiration and
                              support from eugenic thought and practice. Nevertheless,
                              justifications for the presence of these programs and initiatives in
                              public education depended at least as much on their contributions to
                              efficient school operation and the practical success of students and
                              teachers in classrooms as on their origins in eugenics or other social
                              policy. Consequently, the great majority of discussions proposing,
                              explaining, and defending these typical school features emphasized
                              their practical impact.</p> 
                         <p>Race betterment and social improvement may well have been on the minds
                              of many when considering school policy and practice; the
                                        <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                                        reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> experience offers
                              ample support for that assumption. Most documents (official records,
                              professional literature, news media) reveal school officials&apos;
                              primary day-to-day concerns focused on smooth management, student
                              control, efficient use of scarce resources, and particularly, public
                              approval. It is intriguing to consider that such an emphasis on
                              efficient scientific approaches to school administration and pedagogy
                              might well reflect eugenic input. Eugenic theory certainly can be seen
                              in many aspects of <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                                        reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> education: its
                              focus on social efficiency, its acceptance of various social groups,
                              and its dispassionate approach to judging and training children.
                              Ultimately, however, it becomes apparent that eugenics was by no means
                              the sole factor in determining public school development during this
                              era; other features of progressivist thought also played key roles.

                         of the Plymouth Congregational Church. McCulloch, who named the tribe and
                         made its members the focus of his campaign to reform charity and eradicate
                         pauperism, asked untrained observers to conduct &quot;family studies.&quot;

                         tri-racial and was interested in black nationalism, Leaming searched for
                         connections between the Ishmaels and African Islam. In &quot;The Ben
                         Ishmael Tribe: A Fugitive &apos;Nation&apos; of the Old Northwest,&quot; a
                         chapter in <hi rend="i">The Ethnic Frontier: Essays in the History of Group
                              Survival in Chicago and the Midwest</hi> (1977), he declared the
                         Ishmaels to be Muslims of African descent and founders of the Moorish

                         especially online. However, according to Nathaniel Deutsch, they simply
                         aren&apos;t true. Deutsch, a professor of literature and history at the
                         University of California, <placeName><settlement type="city"
                                   key="tgn_7014479" reg="Santa Cruz">Santa
                              Cruz</settlement></placeName>, is the author of books on Judaism,
                         Gnosticism, and early Christianity. His research on marginalized
                         communities and African American religions led him to Leaming&apos;s essay;
                         this book deftly dismisses Leaming&apos;s conclusions as wishful thinking
                         consistent with other American Orientalist ideals. &quot;He literalized
                         elements of [the Ishmaels&apos;] identity that had previously functioned on
                         a symbolic level,&quot; Deutsch says. &quot;Leaming flipped the actual
                         ethnic and racial proportions of the tribe&apos;s members so that . . . he
                         had transformed a collection of poor, overwhelmingly white, Upland
                         Southerner migrants into an African American Islamic community&quot; (p.
                         14). Although the McCulloch notes document mixed-race members as well as
                         some who ignored <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                                   reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>&apos;s Sunday laws,
                         Deutsch asserts that the Ishmaels were actually &quot;white
                         Christians.&quot; Whether that is a leap of faith as long as Leaming&apos;s
                         may someday be known, but Deutsch acknowledges that McCulloch&apos;s study
                         of the Ishmaels helped to fuel anti-immigrant sentiment in the 1880s and
                         beyond.</p> 
                    <p>Deutsch also discusses Arthur H. Estabrook, a caseworker for the Eugenics
                         Record Office (ERO), from 1910 to 1929, and a biologist with particular
                         interest in mixed-race genetics, who edited McCulloch&apos;s Tribe of
                         Ishmael materials after World War I. Although the resulting manuscript
                         was never published, Estabrook and others used it in support of anti-
                         miscegenation and compulsory sterilization laws intended to prevent
                         mixed-race marriage and reproduction by individuals deemed degenerate
                         or mentally unfit. Estabrook&apos;s manuscript was archived in the ERO with
                         other studies of mixed-race groups.</p> 
                    <p>Deutsch critiques &quot;Estabrook&apos;s retrospective diagnosis of the 
                         Ishmaelites as feebleminded&quot; (p. 115) because it was based not on
                         firsthand observation but on McCulloch&apos;s unscientific study. The
                         author points out many problems in Estabrook&apos;s work, including: weak
                         or undisclosed sources; genealogical and statistical missing links;
                         evidence that &quot;gypsying&quot; was not always an indicator of
                         pauperism and that many Ishmaels traveled in search of work, despite
                         accusations of laziness; and no proof that the tendency to travel is
                         genetically determined. In fact, he notes, &quot;Estabrook was unable to
                         provide any evidence that the Tribe of Ishmael still constituted a distinct
                         community—if it ever had&quot; (p. 126).</p>

                         is fascinating. From the end of the nineteenth century through the
                         beginning of the twentieth century, the region that Powell Moore had
                         described as <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                                   reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>&apos;s last frontier
                         became one of the great centers of industrial production. This quick
                         transformation has long given the Calumet region great symbolic value. In
                         his 1979 book, <hi rend="i">The Responsibility of Mind in a Civilization of
                              Machines</hi>, historian Perry Miller framed the paradoxes of modern
                         development. He argued that when previous generations realized that they
                         were incapable of dealing with their world they could blame the gods; but,
                         Miller continued, &quot;whom dare we blame for <placeName><settlement

                         century, however, the steel cities of Northwest <placeName><region

                         potential for industrial growth. Not only did Inland Steel and U.S. Steel
                         build massive industrial complexes to produce steel, they also documented
                         every step of this process with vivid photography. Here was the tabula rasa
                         upon which was to be <pb n="303" id="VAA4025-106-3-093"/> written the
                         history of American industry; both companies kept a record to ensure that

                         of the Calumet region.</p> 
                    <p>In <hi rend="i">Steel Giants</hi>, Stephen McShane and Gary Wilk &quot;bring the reader back to
                         a time of incredible industrial might which defined a region and its
                         people&quot; through these powerful photographs (p. 14). It is a goal
                         which they achieve admirably. The book begins with a brief introduction
                         establishing the history of the region. The authors then use text from an
                         Inland Steel promotional booklet, published in 1911, to set the tone for
                         the collection. The rest of the book consists of photographs that cover
                         the construction of mills, streets, and houses, the process of steel,
                         and the lives of the people who produced the steel.</p> 
                    <p>Taken from the company archives, the photos are both illuminating and
                         deceptive. There was a mythology to steel production carefully crafted both
                         in the buildings of the steel companies and their literature and
                         photography. The photos offer a vantage point designed to inspire awe in
                         the technological and mechanical wonder of modern steel production, while
                         images of workers create a sense of harmony and unity. Campaigns for war
                         bonds, visits from Hollywood stars, and company-sponsored athletics craft
                         an image of a happy, hardworking place. Especially telling in this regard
                         are the images from the early 1940s which show women stepping into the
                         roles and jobs of steel production to do their part. Strikes, conflicts,
                         and workplace dangers have no place within these documentary images. Yet
                         McShane and Wilk are very aware of these issues. &quot;Keep in mind,&quot;
                         they warn, &quot;that the selection of photographs was limited by the
                         contents of the two visual collections created by Inland Steel and U.S.
                         Steel&quot; (p.14). The use of such collections also limits the chronology
                         of the book. While a few photographs taken after 1970 are included in the
                         collection, the bulk of its contents trace the high years of the steel
                         cities from the turn of the century through the 1960s. Missing are images
                         of deindustrialization, mechanization, and job loss. None of this, however,
                         takes away from the visual impact of the collection. It is a wonderful
                         array of images from a time when enormous structures that poured out steel,
                         and the people who worked within these structures, dominated the
                         landscape.</p>

                    <p>American comic icon Richard &quot;Red&quot; Skelton is the fascinating
                         subject of Wes D. Gehring&apos;s new biography, <hi rend="i">Red Skelton:
                              The Mask Behind the Mask</hi>. As the title suggests, Gehring&apos;s
                         well-researched and thoughtful book seeks to explore both the inner life
                         and the public persona of the multifaceted entertainer—&quot;one of <hi
                              rend="i">the</hi> clowns of the twentieth century&quot;—who retained

                    <p>After recounting Skelton&apos;s most successful comic roles and characters,
                         the biography begins with Skelton&apos;s early years in

                                   >Indiana</region></placeName>. The author examines Skelton&apos;s
                         &quot;official&quot; origins, and reveals several family secrets that point
                         to a darker, but more likely, scenario surrounding the comedian&apos;s
                         birth and formative years. Gehring allots emotional truths and observations
                         about the comedian greater import than biological details—or Skelton&apos;s
                         often contradictory recollections. Throughout the book, facts gleaned from
                         interviews with Skelton and his daughter are compared against public
                         records and press materials of the period. Sometimes they match up and
                         sometimes they do not, but Gehring approaches these questions with
                         scrupulous honesty. The author notes that assembling a fact-based
                         through-line was made more difficult, and more colorful, by having to
                         unravel the truth from the accounts that Skelton himself, a master
                         storyteller, was fond of embellishing.</p> 
                    <p>Skelton worked his way up the ladder from &quot;clowning around&quot; and
                         walkathons to higher-profile entertaining gigs. Figures from
                         Skelton&apos;s small-town upbringing not only serve as mentors for the
                         maturing comedian, but are also suggested as possible &quot;ordinary
                         people&quot; types who inspired some of his best-known characters like the
                         unschooled, good-hearted Clem Kadiddlehopper and comedy bits such as the
                         doughnut dunking sketch.</p> 
                    <p>Gehring describes the most important and enduring influence on Skelton&apos;s
                         professional life as his first wife, Edna Stillwell. Stillwell was not only
                         Skelton&apos;s occasional comedy partner on radio and in vaudeville
                         routines, but also his writer and manager. Their successful business
                         relationship lasted longer than their marriage (they divorced in 1943),
                         and this ongoing creative partnership, the author acknowledges, must have
                         been an unwelcome source of tension in Skelton&apos;s later marriages.
                         Despite the divorce, there is no question that Red Skelton understood and
                         appreciated just how crucial Stillwell was to his success.</p> 
                    <pb n="305" id="VAA4025-106-3-095"/> 
                    <p>Skelton achieved early star status in 1937 thanks to hit shows in
                         <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7007567" reg="New York">New York
                         City</settlement></placeName> theaters; reviews from major papers are quoted to lend a sense of his
                         growing appeal. The war years found Skelton on the silver screen with
                         comedy luminaries such as Bob Hope. After joining the military, Skelton
                         labored under such a grueling performance schedule that he suffered a
                         nervous breakdown. When the war ended, he returned to making movies,
                         although many critics at the time (as well as the author) felt that
                         Skelton&apos;s talent and potential were inadequately served by the studio.
                         The comedian, according to his co-stars, always felt more comfortable
                         on radio and, later, on television.</p> 
                    <p>The final chapters of the book are devoted to Skelton&apos;s life after he
                         and Stillwell parted ways for good in 1952. Despite success on the small
                         screen, the comedian suffered darker periods, including various health
                         problems, alcoholic tendencies, depression, and the heartbreaking loss of
                         his son (with Georgia Davis) to leukemia at the age of nine.</p> 
                    <p>Gehring&apos;s work also evokes the era in which Skelton grew up and the
                         sensibilities of the public he was so eager to charm. The author&apos;s
                         assessment of Skelton as a comic genius and a man is evenhanded and
                         well-documented; he does not allow his admiration for Skelton&apos;s
                         talent to blind him to his subject&apos;s weaknesses, or to the more
                         private traits that constitute the &quot;mask behind the mask.&quot; The
                         author&apos;s greatest success, however, is in transforming a
                         considerable amount of research into an engaging and eminently readable
                         portrait of a pop culture icon whose continued impact is undeniable.
                         Though younger readers may not remember Skelton as the comic force he once
                         was, they cannot deny his influence on a generation of later comedians such
                         as Steve Martin, Flip Wilson, and Richard Pryor. For those who do remember
                         the endearing &quot;kidult,&quot; as Stillwell called him, <hi rend="i">Red Skelton:
                         The Mask Behind the Mask</hi> offers an illuminating glimpse into the performer,
                         his best-loved comic characters, his personal history, and the more
                         complex man behind the clown mask.</p>

                         rather unnatural one-considering that Indians&apos; history and sense of
                         place were set in motion long before Euro-Americans ever dreamed of
                         creating bounded spaces called &quot;the Northwest Territory&quot; or
                                   &quot;<placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                                   reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>.&quot; Glenn and
                         Rafert cast this story as one of persistence and argue that &quot;The very
                         large number of tribes represented in <placeName><region type="state"
                                   key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>
                         suggests that the state is not only the crossroads of <placeName><country
                              key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">America</country></placeName>, but the
                         crossroads of Indian America as well&quot; (p. 110). The authors focus
                         largely on two groups, the Miami (and closely related Wea and Piankashaw)
                         and the Potawatomi, but they also include the Shawnee, Kickapoo/Mascouten,
                         Delaware, and Wyandot.</p>
                    <p>The first three chapters move quickly from the pre-Columbian era through
                         1812. Most disappointing is the authors&apos; coverage of the period before
                         European colonization, a span of ten thousand years that merits less than
                         two pages. This seems particularly glaring in light of the high value that
                                   <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"
                                   >Indiana</region></placeName> places on its archaeological sites,
                         for which the state has some of the toughest anti-looting laws in the
                         country. The authors are on firmer ground when discussing Native cultures
                         in the colonial era, particularly when they deal with the fur trade, an
                         exchange that dominated Native-French relations from the late 1600s through
                         1760. Through-out the colonial era, few Euro-Americans lived in the region,
                         and &quot;<placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"
                                   >Indiana</region></placeName> was still Indian territory&quot;
                         (p. 32). This began to change after the American Revolution, when the
                                   <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">United

                    <p>The tone and texture of this book change markedly when Glenn and Rafert
                         discuss the nativist movement led by Tecumseh and his brother Tenskwatawa.
                         Thereafter, Indian actors and voices emerge much more vividly, thanks in
                         part to Rafert&apos;s previous research on the Miami of <placeName><region

                              >Indiana</region></placeName>. Between 1818 and 1840, the federal
                         government forced most Indians to leave <placeName><region type="state"
                                   key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> and
                         settle west of the <geogName key="tgn_7022231" reg="Mississippi River"
                              >Mississippi</geogName>. However, many Miami and a group of Potawatomi
                         managed to avoid removal and remain in their homelands. This book&apos;s
                         greatest strength lies in its discussion of these groups&apos; persistence
                         and their ongoing efforts to assert sovereignty in the post-removal period.
                         During the mid-nineteenth century, the Miami and <pb n="307"
                              id="VAA4025-106-3-097"/>Potawatomi were fairly successful in lobbying
                         the federal government to recognize their rights and pay treaty annuities.
                         Their fortunes changed later in the century due to territorial losses, and,
                         in 1897, the Miami lost federal recognition when they challenged
                         Indiana&apos;s power to tax them. The Potawatomi gained federal recognition
                         in 1994, while the Miami still seek recognition of their sovereignty rights
                         today. In recent decades, Indiana has seen an influx of Native Americans
                         from other regions of the country, and the Cherokee are now the largest
                         Native group in the state. According to the authors, the fact that
                                   <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"
                                   >Indiana</region></placeName> was not targeted under the federal
                         government&apos;s relocation program &quot;meant that Indians made a
                         personal choice to move to the state&quot; (p. 102).</p>
                    <p>While the latter portion of the book is stronger, Glenn and Rafert offer a

                         the turn of the century to the New Deal, from the perspective of an
                         important but understudied group: African American women. The book focuses
                         primarily on black middle-class migrants from the South who came to
                                   <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013596"
                                   reg="Chicago">Chicago</settlement></placeName>. Lisa G. Materson
                         argues that these women brought with them distinctive political memories:
                         they and their families had lived through the disfranchisement of black
                         men, and the imposition of Jim Crow laws and the accompanying racial
                         violence. Such experiences, Materson shows, significantly shaped their
                         political arguments and loyalties. These women consistently supported a
                         stronger federal government as an enforcer of constitutional rights, a
                         stance which later put them on the side of Prohibition—even when increasing
                         numbers of African Americans opposed it in the late 1920s and <pb n="308"
                              id="VAA4025-106-3-098"/> early 1930s-fearing that the repeal of
                         Prohibition might embolden those who favored repeal of the Fifteenth
                         Amendment.</p> 
                    <p>Like white middle-class women during this period, black middle-class women in
                                   <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007251" reg="Illinois"
                                   >Illinois</region></placeName> argued about the benefits of party
                         loyalty versus political independence. Memories of the racist actions of
                         white southern Democrats inclined these women toward a strong Republican
                         loyalty, which was tested by the complicated and shifting factions of
                                   <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013596"
                                   reg="Chicago">Chicago</settlement></placeName> politics and by
                         frequent Republican indifference to their concerns.</p> 
                    <p>Materson made a good decision to organize the book around several critical
                         junctures when women&apos;s voting rights expanded. At the first of these,
                         in 1894, <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007251" reg="Illinois"
                                   >Illinois</region></placeName> women could vote for the first
                         time, though only in university trustee elections. Black women organized in
                         support of candidates who favored black access to the University of
                         Illinois; but more interestingly, they used this small local contest for
                         trustee positions to express loyalty to the Republican Party and its
                         historic commitment to racial equality and the unfinished business of
                         Reconstruction. In 1913, the state granted women the vote in presidential
                         and municipal elections, and, of course, in 1920, full suffrage was finally
                         attained. At that point, black women organized via the Colored Women&apos;s
                         Department of the Republican National Committee and through the National
                         Association of Colored Women.</p> 
                    <p>The question of loyalty versus independence became ever more urgent with
                         Republican unwillingness to press for a federal anti-lynching law. This
                         dilemma produced defections to the Democrats among some middle-class
                         black women, who also criticized Republicans for their unwillingness to
                         support black women for civil service jobs. This growing tension, the
                         precursor to black realignment toward the Democrats in the mid-1930s, is
                         a particularly interesting thread throughout the book. The gradual shift
                         away from the Republican Party, which accelerated after Roosevelt&apos;s
                         election in 1932, was in part, it seems to me, an effect of generational
                         change, though Materson does not explicitly acknowledge this.</p> 
                    <p>The shift toward the Democrats also had a class dimension, as poor and
                         working-class African Americans were most affected by the Depression. In a
                         fascinating story, the author describes how black middle-class Republican
                         women continued to organize via mainstream black churches, despite the fact
                         that poor blacks and more recent Southern migrants could increasingly be
                         found in small storefront churches.</p> 
                    <p>The book offers a thorough description of the role of civic and religious
                         organizations, and establishes the importance of women&apos;s networks in
                                   <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013596"

                         women&apos;s clubs clearly played a significant role in socializing

                    <p>This volume contains eleven biographical essays on midwestern women from
                         the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. According to editor Yvonne J.
                         Johnson, the collection grew out of her interest in gathering stories of
                         midwestern women&apos;s activism. Johnson argues that the Midwest is
                         unique in American women&apos;s history because of its transformation over
                         the nineteenth century from farmland to an agricultural and industrial
                         powerhouse. According to Johnson, the region also has a reputation as a
                         crucible for reform, as the mobility of its male and female inhabitants
                         &quot;may have contributed to a more socially and politically progressive
                         spirit&quot; (p. xi). The essays are loosely held together by their focus
                         on women across the Midwest involved in some type of reform; and while many
                         of the 2010. women profiled had some feminist tendencies, what links them
                         is a notion of a &quot;universally recognized belief in human
                         equality&quot; (p. x). Each essay is a biographical sketch of one woman,
                         and her reform efforts, attempts at reform, or thoughts about reform,
                         throughout her life. While each essay has its merits, not all of the lives
                         of the women included support the editor&apos;s thesis, weakening the

                         speech, to Genora Dollinger, who blended feminist and union activism during
                         her participation in the 1937 Flint sit-down strikes against General Motors
                         and afterward.</p> 
                    <p>Some of the women profiled, unlike Gage and Dollinger, do not demonstrate a
                         belief in human equality, much less feminism or social reform. For
                         example, Mary Ellen Rowe argues that Missourian Mary Sibley owned six
                         slaves and could not have run her farm and school without them; according
                         to Rowe, Sibley &quot;did her duty as she saw it&quot; (p. 29). South
                         Dakotan Marietta M. Bones turned from supporting woman suffrage to
                         actively campaigning against it, delaying the passage of suffrage in the
                         state for twenty-eight years after it was first on a statewide ballot in
                         1890 (p. 81). Taken as a whole, this essay collection leaves the impression
                         that midwestern women, with the exceptions of Gage, Dollinger, and Harriet
                         Friedman Woods, tended toward moderate, local, and conservative reform
                         efforts and overall acquiescence with the gender roles of their times. This
                         impression undermines the editor&apos;s original intent to show the
                         &quot;more socially and politically progressive spirit&quot; evident in
                         midwestern women&apos;s experiences.</p> 
                    <p>This volume introduces many lesser-known women into the historical
                         landscape of the Midwest, and Johnson&apos;s call for more research on how
                         women shaped the social, political, and educational culture of the region
                         is well merited. However, this collection would have benefitted from a
                         tighter and more rigorous focus on how ideas and ideals of feminism have
                         changed across the nineteenth and twentieth centuries when viewed through
                         the lives and actions of midwestern women.</p>

                    <p>Paul Michael Taillon has written a much-needed study of railroaders, which
                         focuses primarily on the running trades. While earlier studies by Walter
                         Licht and Sheldon Stromquist examine railroaders&apos; work life, Taillon
                              <pb n="311" id="VAA4025-106-3-101"/> focuses on their labor relations,
                         unions, and the brotherhoods&apos; transformations from fraternal groups
                         to more typical trade unions. He synthesizes labor, gender, and cultural
                         history to study workers&apos; lives and institutions. While many
                         historians have ignored the railroad brotherhoods—which they considered too
                         conservative—Taillon argues that a serious examination of the actions of
                         brotherhoods allows us to focus on what they <hi rend="i">did</hi>
                         accomplish rather than what they <hi rend="i">should</hi> have
                         accomplished. He contends that the railroad brotherhoods became a potent
                         force in a key economic sector and in national politics. They commanded the
                         loyalty of thousands of workers, navigated treacherous waters that
                         destroyed other unions, and, finally, by working for passage of the Erdman
                         Act of 1898, helped to bring about state-sanctioned collective
                         bargaining.</p> 
                    <p>Almost two dozen unions represented railroad workers, although four draw
                         most of Taillon&apos;s attention—the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers,
                         the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen, the Brotherhood of Railroad
                         Trainmen, and the Order of Railroad Conductors. Those four, however, were
                         unusual. First, they were not affiliated with the American Federation of
                         Labor. Secondly, they often stood apart because, occupying a strategic
                         place in the economy, they contributed to national progress in a way their
                         peers could not. The railroad trade produced strains on families that
                         other workers did not have to endure. While most working-class Americans
                         faced physical exploitation, railroaders in the running trades often
                         endured irregular hours and long absences from home. The brotherhoods in
                         their early years &quot;were as much all-male fraternal associations as
                         they were labor unions&quot; (p. 39). While operatives struggled to define
                         themselves as men according to nineteenth-century cultural expectations,
                         their wives adapted the ideals of &quot;true womanhood&quot; to the
                         realities of family life. By the beginning of the twentieth century,
                         notions of Victorian manhood began to give way to the stresses of modern
                         society, further perpetuated by Theodore Roosevelt&apos;s call for a
                         &quot;strenuous life.&quot; Roosevelt pointed to rail workers as examples
                         of manly toughness and strength, and Taillon suggests that this image of
                         railroaders may have contributed to a middle-class reconstruction of 
                         manhood at the turn of the century.</p> 
                    <p>The brotherhoods&apos; cultures were also changing, however, not 
                         necessarily in ways consistent with Roosevelt&apos;s pronouncements. In the
                         nineteenth-century paradigm of manhood, railroaders and their bosses
                         could meet as men to discuss their differences—a way advocated by Eugene
                         Debs when he edited the <hi rend="i">Locomotive Firemen&apos;s Magazine</hi>. By the
                         twentieth century, male culture had changed, and it was no longer 
                         possible for worker and boss to sit across the table from one another. The
                         brotherhoods abandoned many of their fraternal trappings and  <pb
                              n="312" id="VAA4025-106-3-102"/> transformed themselves into more 
                         traditional unions. The Erdman Act, with its emphasis on mediation and 
                         arbitration under federal auspices, also represented this new
                         direction.</p> 
                    <p><hi rend="i">Good, Reliable, White Men</hi> adds to our understanding of
                         railroad labor unions in this crucial era. Taillon successfully
                         challenges the idea that the brotherhoods were conservative; instead, he
                         shows that they continued a sustained tradition of working-class
                         activism. Scholars may disagree with some of his conclusions, but this book
                         will raise questions and prompt a re-thinking of earlier scholarship which
                         tended to ignore railroad brotherhoods. It also adds one more piece to the
                         puzzle of the origins and legacy of progressivism.</p>

                         embeds its intriguing answers to such questions in a rich historical

                    <p>First, and arguably most importantly, are the 1929 and 1937 Middletown

                                   reg="Muncie">Middletown</settlement></placeName>, depicted as the

                         second milestone enterprise concerns the development of scientific polling
                         methods in the mid-1930s, spearheaded by pollsters George Gallup and Elmo
                         Roper, whose companies measured white Americans&apos; traits, opinions, and
                         behaviors over and over again. The initial purpose was to help merchants
                         advertise their wares more efficiently. The statistical mean of their
                         survey data then became the &quot;average&quot; American—the &quot;mass
                         public,&quot; to whom business people, politicians, and their fellow
                         citizens would cater. The 1948 and 1953 Kinsey <pb n="313"
                              id="VAA4025-106-3-103"/> Reports about sexual behaviors of white
                         American populations were the third milestone. The surveys revealed that
                         many presumed sexual aberrations were more common than people had hitherto
                         believed. They fell within average limits. Strangely, from a scholarly
                         perspective, all of these landmark social scientific endeavors excluded
                         significant minorities from their population samples.</p> 
                    <p>Igo uses these milestones in the history of survey development to describe
                         how polls were organized and conducted and how the findings portrayed
                         average Americans, as glimpsed through the lens of surveys, then reflected
                         by pundits, and finally absorbed by publics. Not surprisingly,
                         photographing the public, so-to-speak, through questioning selected
                         individuals yielded images that were quite at odds with less scientific
                         previous assessments.</p> 
                    <p>Igo&apos;s analyses of the data are insightful, well-argued, and fascinating.
                         She explains why people accept surveys as facts, making survey findings 
                         the yardstick by which they judge themselves and their environment.
                         Average becomes equated to standard, normal, and typical. People become
                         willing, and even eager, to merge their identities into the reported
                         norms. Spiral effects ensue, so that accepted standards shape subsequent
                         surveys and the analyses that they evoke.</p> 
                    <p>Beyond her examination of the evolution of surveys, Igo also records some of
                         the publicized vocal reactions to polls that either pleased or offended
                         portions of the public. It is refreshing to learn that many people have
                         not shied away from talking back to pollsters in solo efforts or in large
                         choruses. Those who are not intimidated by the aura of precision 
                         conveyed by numbers have challenged the scientific merit of the survey
                         enterprise, its ethics, as well as the soundness of the findings.</p> 
                    <p>Ultimately, Igo leaves her readers with the distinct impression that the
                         &quot;averaged American&quot; is a phony concoction and that there is no
                         unified mass public. That verdict is not particularly scary. Americans
                         are used to exposes that demolish prior truths. What is scary is the
                         symbolic power of this manufactured, disembodied vision of average
                         Americans and uniform mass publics that conceals the rich diversity of
                         America. Too many people, including social scientists, continue to react to
                         these images as if they were real. Their imprint on American culture
                         remains profound even though they have been partially counterbalanced by
                         subsequent surveys of various minority populations.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="i">Suburban Steel</hi> is animated by a curious bias. The author,
                         Douglas Knerr, believes that <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United
                              States">America</country></placeName> would have been better off if the
                         Lustron Corporation had succeeded in selling low-cost, prefabricated
                         steel homes to the American public. A reader who shares Knerr&apos;s belief
                         in the superiority of the prefabricated metal home to the mass-produced
                         wood and sheetrock version will be impressed by the Lustron visionaries
                         brought to life in the book.</p> 
                    <p>Knerr lays a strong groundwork by demonstrating how Lustron appeared to
                         post-World War II advocates as a potentially successful national
                         prefabrication operation—rather than as an absurd experiment. In the
                         decades following the war, affordable housing advocates sought to create a
                         national housing company, like Lustron, that could build and deliver
                         housing as efficiently as Ford assembly lines produced autos. Understanding
                         prefabrication as a reform movement, and Lustron as an apparently logical
                         outgrowth of that effort, is essential to understanding how the Truman
                         administration could sink so much money into a revolutionary product.</p> 
                    <p>Knerr then describes, with some economy and style, the personalities and
                         organizations behind Lustron, the business plan, the Ohio factory, the
                         distribution network, and the product itself: a mostly steel home that
                         featured enameled surfaces and modern conveniences that could be shipped
                         (disassembled) anywhere in the <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149"
                              reg="United States">United States</country></placeName> on a single tractor trailer.
                         Knerr makes a good case that the Lustron house was cleverly designed,
                         well-liked by those few who purchased them, and at the center of post-war
                         debates about providing &quot;a decent home&quot; and good communities for
                         working people.</p> 
                    <p>If the author gets a little breathless about the superiority of Lustron, he
                         also reveals in detail the missteps that bankrupted the company: 
                         government interference by both Democrats and Republicans; deficiencies in
                         the business plan (even the basic Lustron house was more expensive than
                         promised); and shortcomings in the original designs that alienated
                         potential buyers and made site construction difficult.</p> 
                    <p>Lustron&apos;s failure as an individual business, he argues, should not blind
                         modern readers to the superior high standards set by the company for 
                         pre-fabricated housing. Knerr notes, for instance, the growing market share
                         today of cut-rate mobile homes in the low-end housing market. He asserts
                         that Lustron&apos;s survival would have improved modern prefabricated 
                         housing because Lustron houses, even in the 1940s, were much better designed
                              <pb n="315" id="VAA4025-106-3-105"/> than today&apos;s mobile homes in
                         terms of function, materials, and energy use.</p> 
                    <p>Knerr&apos;s extensive research provides valuable insights into public
                         policy, business history, architecture, and even engineering, but fails to
                         offer perspective on the impact that greater mass production would have
                         made on the American landscape. Lustron&apos;s houses were extraordinarly
                         difficult to rebuild, expand, and personalize compared to more traditional
                         homes. The houses in <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2070198"
                                   reg="Levittown">Levittown</settlement></placeName> and other
                         community-builder suburbs, which used traditional materials and site-based
                         mass production, have since been transformed and expanded in ways that
                         would be very difficult for steel Lustron structures.
                         <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2070198"
                                   reg="Levittown">Levittown</settlement></placeName> residents,
                         according to historian Barbara Kelly, have put their personal stamp on
                         their homes and enhanced their value, as have other suburbanites across the
                         country.</p> 
                    <p>In the long run, a nation of Lustron homes, in a limited variety of
                         nationally marketed styles, would have undermined the do-it-yourself spirit
                         of American postwar culture. Knerr overlooks the ways that the inflexible,
                         mass-produced steel home restricted self-expression and sweat equity. While
                         television and mass consumerism did define much of postwar middle-class
                         American culture and society, Americans simultaneously sought out ways
                         to personalize and improve their environments. Knerr works hard throughout 
                         to show that a big potential market existed for Lustron homes, but he
                         never entirely eliminates the sense that the wider public rejected
                         Lustron&apos;s &quot;machine for living.&quot;</p>

                    <p>Patrick Hagopian&apos;s long-awaited book, decades in the making, arrives at
                         a time when the U.S. military intervention in <placeName><country
                              key="tgn_1000145" reg="Viet Nam">Vietnam</country></placeName> has become a hot
                         topic in memory studies. A new generation of authors, too young to have
                         experienced the war or its social upheavals, has begun to produce important
                         studies on how the era has been remembered and commemorated, both here
                         and in <placeName><country
                              key="tgn_1000145" reg="Viet Nam">Vietnam</country></placeName>.</p>
                    <p>At first sight, the subject of Hagopian&apos;s book is the broad terrain of
                         local and national monuments to <placeName><country key="tgn_1000145"

                         </placeName>; to the dozens of state and local
                         memorials erected ever since. The book is not meant to be an exhaustive
                         catalog of all such monuments; instead, the author classifies them into
                         certain types and bores deeply into representative examples.
                         Hagopian&apos;s real subject, however, is not simply the objects
                         themselves, but the psychiatric and political discourses that at once
                         spurred these memorial efforts and constrained their expressive
                         potential.</p> 
                    <p>In a nutshell, Hagopian argues that the &quot;therapeutic discourse of wounds
                         and healing&quot; (p. 19), ostensibly a neutral platform for uniting left
                         and right in mutual sympathy for the veteran as victim, was enormously
                         powerful in generating support for memorial efforts across the U.S. But at
                         the same time, the emphasis on healing was a political rhetoric that
                         extended therapy to the nation itself, and by so doing prevented its people
                         from engaging in a genuine moral accounting of the cause and the conduct
                         of the U.S. military in <placeName><country key="tgn_1000145"
                              reg="Viet Nam">Vietnam</country></placeName>.</p> 
                    <p>Thus, Hagopian begins the argument with a fascinating account of the
                         psychiatric origins of the healing discourse and how it spread into the
                         commemorative sphere. Jan Scruggs, the founder of the national Vietnam
                         Veterans Memorial Fund and himself a psychologist of war trauma, emerges as
                         a key figure in this transition from treatment to commemoration.
                         Hagopian&apos;s discussion of that seminal memorial, however, delves
                         equally deeply into the complex micro-politics surrounding the monument
                         campaign in the early days of the Reagan administration. The author seems
                         to have gone through every scrap of paper in the relevant archives. His
                         reconstruction of the political calculations going on behind the scenes
                         in the White House, as Reagan&apos;s aides worried and argued about the
                         controversy&apos;s impact on their Central America policy, is a tour de
                         force. Of all of the scholarship on this one monument, Hagopian&apos;s is
                         surely the most carefully researched and substantive piece of work
                         produced to date; indeed, it is hard to imagine that any future scholar
                         could ever surpass his account of the political controversy.</p> 
                    <p>From here, the book expands outward to discuss the phenomenal success of the
                         national memorial and its progeny, including the Vietnam Women&apos;s
                         Memorial, the several travelling versions of the Wall, and the many state
                         and local monuments that have helped to solidify the tropes of
                         reconciliation, reunion, rescue, and succor. In the process the author
                         shows how the antiwar movement, which had been crucial in generating the
                         early psychiatric discourse, has been all but eclipsed. Hagopian suggests
                         that the memorials themselves have enabled the once-pointed moral critique
                         of the <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States"
                                   >U.S.</country></placeName> military to be superseded by a new
                         discourse of patriotic support for the troops. Some memorials have left the
                         pretense of neutrality behind, and, like <placeName><region type="state"

                         Southeast Asia was &quot;noble&quot; (p. 421).</p> 
                    <p>Hagopian&apos;s book is a powerful reflection on the healing power and moral
                         equivocation of war memorials. If I have one objection, it is that he does
                         not situate his subject in the longer history of war memorialization in the
                                   <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States"
                                   >U.S.</country></placeName>, which laid much of the groundwork

                         is a subject for another book and, perhaps, another time.</p>

                         evocative photography brings to light the abandoned and neglected

                         and post offices. With an image of sunlight pouring through the broken

                         captures the &quot;decaying glory&quot; of the neo-gothic sanctuary (p.

                         the structures photographed in his first book are now gone. Some of his

                    <p>For true crime enthusiasts looking for a collection of interesting tidbits,
                         W. C. Madden has produced a collection of (very) short stories about many
                         of the gruesome murders, and not so playful mayhem, which occurred in and
                         around <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013848" reg="Lafayette"
                                   >Lafayette</settlement></placeName> from the mid-1850s through
                         the 1980s. Despite the title, the volume extends beyond the city limits to
                         include reports of misdeeds from <placeName><region type="county"
                                   key="tgn_1002946" reg="Tippecanoe"
                              >Tippecanoe</region></placeName> and surrounding counties, although
                         the vast majority of accounts come from the <placeName><settlement
                                   type="city" key="tgn_7013848" reg="Lafayette"
                                   >Lafayette</settlement></placeName> area. The stories are
                         presented chronologically—perhaps to show the reader that despite the
                         passing of years, the basic motivations for crime remain the same. Madden
                         uses a casual, conversational style of writing that emulates the newspaper
                         articles he discusses, affording less than two pages for each story.
                         Unfortunately, the author provides no historical context or analysis for
                         the volume. However, for those who enjoy short, odd, and occasionally
                         gruesome stories, which include topics like temperance, multiple murders,
                         and suicide (including one by guillotine), this book will give them that
                         and much more. </p>

                    <p>Anyone who has followed the excellent Steel Shavings series might be
                         curious about its longtime editor, James B. Lane. Over the years, Lane and
                         many of his students at Indiana University Northwest have conducted and
                         published oral histories on a wide variety of topics centered on the
                         Calumet region. Lane is now retired from a nearly four-decade teaching
                         career, and this volume, written in the first-person, follows the first
                         months of his retirement, from November 2007 through New Year&apos;s Day
                         2009. The volume offers Lane&apos;s take on historians, colleagues, and
                         students past and present; some of the many other topics considered include
                         contemporary politics, sports, and popular culture. </p>

                    <p>In the years that followed the American Revolution, the federal government 
                         was, at best, minimally involved in the issuing of currency for the
                         new republic. Thousands of individual banks issued notes based primarily,
                         but not always, on the amount of gold and silver in their vaults. In this
                         excellent monograph, Stephen Mihm examines the counterfeit economy that
                         blossomed and flourished during this period of political and economic
                         instability. Thick with colorful and sketchy characters who took advantage
                         of the chaotic beginnings and expansion of the fledgling nation to create
                         their own wealth, this book is a valuable analysis of the cultural,
                         economic, and political conditions that ultimately led to the establishment
                         of a single, national currency produced and supported by a single
                         entity—the Federal government- after the Civil War.</p>

                    <p>From September 1862 until just a few days before his death in June 1864,
                         William McKnight wrote dozens of letters to his wife Samaria. The long,
                         detailed letters provide insight into camp life, battles, and
                         William&apos;s deep feelings for his family. Many readers will be
                         particularly interested in the correspondence dealing with John Hunt
                         Morgan. In July 1863, Morgan took up temporary residence at the McKnight
                         house during his raid through <placeName><region type="state"

                         William when he learned the news. Eleven months later, McKnight&apos;s
                         regiment faced Morgan at the battle of Cynthiana, where McKnight was
                         mortally wounded. An epilogue and appendices detail the fate of Samaria and
                         her six children, and offer information on McKnight&apos;s regiment and

                         small but increasing number of serious works on modern Amish communities.
                         Charles Hurst and David McConnell have written a fascinating sociological
                         study of the largest contiguous Amish community in the world, in

                         the twenty-first century (p. xi). After their first chapter, which
                         establishes the history of the community and the distinct groups of Amish
                         within its boundaries, the authors consider the themes of religious
                         diversity, family life, education, occupations, and health care. Readers

                         with Coffee Sauce). The pictured menus and, of course, the recipes that
                         dominate the book, recall an era when passengers could enjoy an appetizer,
                         fresh-baked bread, soup, salad, a main course, and dessert, as they rolled

                                   key="tgn_7013596" reg="Chicago">Chicago</settlement></placeName>,
                                   <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013445" reg="Boston"
                                   >Boston</settlement></placeName>, and <placeName><settlement
                                   type="city" key="tgn_7007567" reg="New York">New
                                   York</settlement></placeName>) and territories (Charlotina,
                         Deseret, and Nickajack), as well as a few foreign countries
                         (<placeName><country key="tgn_7006417" reg="Shqipëria"
                                   >Albania</country></placeName>, <placeName><country
                                   key="tgn_7004624" reg="Cuba">Cuba</country></placeName>, and
                         <placeName><country key="tgn_7003122" reg="Sicilia"
                                   >Sicily</country></placeName>). Who could resist reading about
                         <placeName><country key="tgn_7006417" reg="Shqipëria"
                                   >Albania</country></placeName>, with the subhead: &quot;They Love
                         America—like a stalker&quot;? Beyond the odd and sometimes unbelievable
                         stories, the book also offers a fantastic foldable map, cleverly disguised
                         as the cover jacket. Printed by the aptly named Quirk Books, <hi rend="i"
                              >Lost States</hi> is an excellent gift for anyone interested in
                         history, pop culture, and weird trivia in general.</p> </div>
