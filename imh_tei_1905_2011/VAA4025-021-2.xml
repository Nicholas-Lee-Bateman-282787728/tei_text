            <p rend="center">PREFACE</p>
            <p>This collection of sketches is not presumed to be a complete history of the various Big Four (or

                    sketches, and would probably contain much of little interest to the average reader. Accordingly, the
                    beginnings of the different roads now comprising the Big Four in Indiana have been
                    featured—their building, financing, original planning, and the like. In some cases, some
                    later history has been included, in order to carry the effects of the policies inaugurated when the
                    roads were built, to their logical conclusion. Again, some later history has also been introduced to
                    show the gradual changes which took place and which welded several small and struggling lines of
                    railroad into parts of one great system.</p>
            <p>The writer acknowledges with thanks the assistance and advice received from many Big Four officials
                    and others interested in Indiana history, whose part has been specifically mentioned in the
                    sketches. He also wishes to thank, for the same reason, Prof. Harlow Lindley and Miss Lucy Elliott,

            <p>The field of railroad history in Indiana has been but little explored; and the writer would feel his
                    efforts had been repaid if the following sketches should stimulate any degree of interest in the
                    subject.</p>
            <p rend="center">INTRODUCTION</p>
            <p>Like all Indiana history between 1830 and 1860, the story of the building of railroads during that
                    period contains much romance. The line of the "middle border", of which Hamlin
                    Garland has charmingly written, had not passed far beyond Indiana's western boundary; and
                    in great part, their primitive modes of living and the primitive tools and methods by which the work
                    of the pioneers was carried on, are reflected in the building of the early railroads.</p>
            <p>Above all stands out that which has principally given the history of the middle west its undeniably
                    romantic interest—the spirit of progress and enterprise that animated the pioneers of
                    "the new west", the spirit that transformed a virgin wilderness in a few decades
                    into a flourishing region in agriculture, commerce and industry. The story of few early enterprises
                    of Indiana shows that spirit more abundantly than that of the railroads. True, it does not always
                    appear in worthy forms; there was much unscrupulous and underhand work, a great deal of greed,
                    speculation and loose business methods. Most railroad projectors thought railroads would prove to be
                    veritable El Dorados—and like the El Dorado of <pb n="111" id="VAA4025-021-2-003"/> the
                    Spanish explorers, the promised wealth proved in many cases to be as elusive in reality as it was
                    glittering in fable.</p>
            <p>The writer has endeavored to portray the romance of these early roads in the beginnings of the three
                    main railroads of the present Big Four lines built in Indiana before the Civil war—the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Bellefontaine, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He has also endeavored to show the tremendous strides railroading has made in seventy
                    years in business methods as well as in operation and equipment; and to pay tribute to the pioneers
                    of vision and industry who built these lines and started them on useful and prosperous
                    careers—men like Oliver Hampton Smith, Albert S. White, and George H. Dunn.</p>
            <p rend="center">THE INDIANAPOLIS AND BELLEFONTAINE AND RAILROAD</p>
            <p>The stretch of railroad between <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Union City, Indiana, now a part of the Big Four system, is the oldest part of that
                    system in Indiana, and the second line of railroad to be built in the state. It was built under the
                    name of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Bellefontaine railroad, because it connected at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Union City</settlement>
                    </placeName> with a line to Bellefontaine, which was built about the same time. It has had several
                    changes of ownership since it was chartered in 1848, and this sketch treats principally of its
                    building and operation from that date to its completion at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Union City</settlement>
                    </placeName> in December, 1852.</p>
            <p>With the early development of Indiana and the manifest need for internal improvements, it was natural
                    that there should be talk of railroads. The first recorded mention of them is in O. H.
                    Smith's reminiscences of his campaign for congress in 1826, the same year in which the
                    first railroad was built in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. He was having a joint debate with his opponent, Judge John Test, at <placeName>

                        <p>The judge was speaking, and for the first time introduced the new subject of railroads. He

                            voice, "I tell you, fellow citizens, that in <placeName>

                            in America." This was enough. The crowd set up a loud laugh at the expense of the
                            judge. An old fellow, standing by me, bawled out, "You are crazy, or do you think
                            we are fools; a man could never live a moment at that speed." The day was mine. The
                            judge had ruined his prospects by telling such an improbable story at that day.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

            <p>It is a singular fact that O. H. Smith was the president of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Bellefontaine railroad during the period of this sketch, a position which required
                    at times courage and foresight as well as business sagacity.</p>
            <p>The Indiana legislature passed an Internal Improvements bill in 1836, but the turnpikes and canals
                    were its chief beneficiaries. However, they were not a success, as a rule, and the panic of 1837
                    complicated matters further. The repeal of this action January 28, 1842, according to Esarey: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Marked the beginning of the railroad era. The people were rid of all illusions of state-owned
                            enterprises and ready to go to work as best they could by private means.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

            <p>Still the era of actual railroad building was not to begin immediately. The tariff of 1842 took
                    railroad iron off the free list and made it subject to a duty of seventeen dollars a ton on hammered
                    bar iron and twenty-five dollars a ton on rolled bar iron. This, in those days, meant about fifty to
                    eighty per cent. The Walker tariff, passed in 1846, reduced this duty to thirty per cent on both
                    classes; and this proved the needed impetus to railroad building, not only in Indiana, but also in
                    other parts of the <placeName>

            <p>The idea of a privately owned railroad operating its own rolling stock, and such financing as bonds

            <quote rend="blockquote">
                    <p>Plainly the people thought of the railroad as another form of public highway different from the
                        State road, the pike and the canal, but still a public highway. With this thought, farmers along
                        the right of way subscribed for stock, intending to pay for it by working on the road; and in
                        this manner the roads were actually financed and built.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

            <p>Another factor contributing to this condition was the depression in the market for railroad
                    securities caused by the big nation-wide boom in railroad building after 1846. The <hi rend="i">Indiana, State Sentinel</hi> refers often to the stringency of the money market during the

            <p>Excitement ran high along the proposed right-of-way continuously from the time the road was chartered
                    until it was built. However, as railroads were then comparatively unknown in Indiana, there were a

                    of the president to the directors, March 6, 1849. At this time the total subscribers amounted to
                    1,320, and a total subscription of $279,299, which included 49,653 acres of land and town

                    subscribers was 2,191, and the subscriptions $389,750. An analysis of these subscriptions
                    is given in the report of Col. Thomas Morris, the chief engineer of the road, for December 4, 1859:</p>

                    three hundred in fifteen years. However, the tight money market already referred to, was against
                    these bonds, so that Mr. Smith, in his report to the directors in March, 1849, relates that the
                    five-year bonds were selling for $86.60 cash, and the fifteen year bonds for
                    $80 cash. The <hi rend="i">Indiana State Sentinel</hi> often referred to the tight money
                    market in appeals for the subscribers to pay their subscriptions, and also contains talk from the

            <p>President Smith, in his report of March 6, 1849, estimated the cost of the eighty-three miles of road
                    "ready for the cars" as $722,100, or $8,700 per mile for the
                    T-rail and $494,084, or $5,953 per mile for flat bar. Rails are now made of
                    rolled steel, but in those days they were wrought iron. The rails on the early roads were simply
                    flat bars of iron, although the rail in the shape of a letter T, commonly called the T-rail, was
                    invented in 1830. Though it is used on all standard roads today, it was just coming into wide use at
                    the time the Bellefontaine road was being built. Its superior strength and durability caused it to
                    be used on the new road in spite of its higher cost. The rail used cost forty-five dollars a long
                    ton at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>

                    </placeName>, and weighed sixty pounds to the yard. According to an old conductor on the road, three
                    men in those days could carry a single rail. The rail now used by the Big Four varies in weight from
                    sixty-seven to one hundred ten pounds a yard, and in a few mountainous sections the Pennsylvania now
                    uses one hundred and twenty-five pound rail. In <placeName>

                    </placeName> where the people showed special interest in the details of the road, a newspaper
                    devoted a half column to an explanation of the T-rail, "and a section of one was also
                    exhibited in one of the local stores."<hi rend="sup">10</hi> Although the T-rail was used
                    on the main track, the side-tracks were constructed of the old-fashioned flat-bar rail, according to
                    J. Q. Van Winkle, assistant to the vice-president of the Bif Four.</p>

                    </placeName> to the state line. Contracts were let for the grubbing and grading in the fall of 1849,
                    and Col. Morris, the chief engineer, in his report of December 4, 1849, gives the cost as
                    $163,502, comprising the grubbing, $20,443; grading, $105,652; and
                    bridging, $37,407. At that time the grubbing and clearing had been completed on the first
                    section. The following from his report, shows the method of construction in those days: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>I have provided for ballasting the entire road with gravel to the depth of one foot, upon
                            which longitudinal sills 3 × 12′ will be placed under each rail
                            throughout the entire track. Upon these sills, cross ties 7 1/2′ long, or large
                            enough to square six feet, will be placed at an average distance of three feet from centre
                            to centre. Upon the cross cies the iron will be secured in the ordinary way by chairs and
                            spikes, the track to be filled with gravel to the top of the cross ties.</p>
                    </quote>
                </p>
            <p>It may be explained that a chair is an iron piece, fastened to the tie, into which the rail fits. It
                    has been discarded in most parts of the <placeName>

                    </placeName>. This construction, though the most substantial known in that day, was not any too much
                    so. George S. Cottman writes that the strain of traffic <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>loosened the spikes, and the strain, moreover, very frequently caused the loosened rails to
                            curl upward at the ends, threatening punctures and derailment; and these snake-heads, as
                            they were called, had to be constantly guarded against. A not uncommon occurrence was the
                            stoppage of trains till the trainmen went ahead with a sledge hammer to spike down rails.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>

                    was $1,014,237.16, an average of $12,253.68 a mile. Dr. Kemper writes that

                    year for the Bellefontaine road. Estimating half this amount for operating expenses, this would
                    leave $132,842.50 net revenue a year, or over thirteen per cent of the capital required
                    "to construct and equip the road." However, the construction estimates were far

                    those days, and when the road was completed to Pendleton, October 8, 1850, there was "a

                    left there at 5:15 in the morning, making a run of thirty-five miles to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> in two and one-half hours. Today, the <placeName>

            <p>About the same time, a staff member of the <hi rend="i">Sentinel</hi> "paid ourselves the

                    of April 28, 1851. The train left <placeName>

                    o'clock. The writer describes some of the towns along the road, and shows some of the local
                    advantages possessed by the route for both freight and passenger traffic. The account, in part, is
                    as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The road passes through a fine agricultural country—farms being rapidly improved,
                            new buildings meet the eye, villages are springing up on the line, and all seems quite alive
                            with active industry. Pendleton is quite a considerable town and looks business like. It is
                            located on the falls of <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Fall Creek</settlement>
                            </placeName>; here are extensive quarries and heavy water power, the creek passing over a
                            natural dam of solid rock near twelve feet. A large amount of flour is manufactured here
                            that passes over the railroad. About a mile east of Pendleton on <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Fall Creek</settlement>
                            </placeName> is Huntsville, a smart village. Here, as at <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Pendleton</settlement>
                            </placeName>, there is ample water power and one of the best merchant mills in the state
                            doing a heavy business. Pendleton and Huntsville must always afford much freight for the
                            railroad.</p>
                        <p>About eight miles above Pendleton we come to Anderson, the seat of justice of <placeName>
                                <region type="county">Madison county</region>
                            </placeName>, located on a high and beautiful bluff of <pb n="124" id="VAA4025-021-2-016"/>
                            <geogName>White river</geogName>. The iron is partly laid from Pendleton to Anderson; the
                            road, we learn, will be opened to that place in a few weeks, with a great barbecue
                            celebration, etc. Anderson is located in the center of one of the best sections of the
                                <geogName>White River</geogName> valley, having at its base the great hydraulic power
                            created by the navigable feeder by which <geogName>White river</geogName> is thrown over a
                            bluff of 30 ft.; and being the point where the travel from the upper <placeName>

                            </placeName> turns as well as from the lower Mississinewa, and where it will take or leave
                            the cars, must have great advantages, and cannot fail to become a town of business and
                            growing importance. From Anderson the road runs on the south side of <geogName>White
                            river</geogName> eighteen miles to <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                            </placeName>, the county seat of <placeName>
                                <region type="county">Delaware County</region>
                            </placeName>, through a beautiful, settled country. On this section the road passes
                            Chesterfield, a small village five miles from Anderson, and Yorktown, a growing village,
                            located at the junction of Big Buck creek with <geogName>White river</geogName>. At this
                            point there is heavy water power, with merchant mills in full operation; there must be a
                            considerable freight business from both these points. We learn that the road is to be
                            completed and in operation this fall to <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                            </placeName>, fifty-three miles from <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                            </placeName>. <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                            </placeName> is the largest town on <geogName>White river</geogName> above <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                            </placeName>, and is no doubt destined to become a large inland town. It is surrounded by
                            one of the best wheat countries in the state, has ample water power, and steam works are
                            being constructed. This point must give a heavy business to the road. From near <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                            </placeName> the road runs on the north side of <geogName>White river</geogName> to near
                            Winchester, the county seat of <placeName>
                                <region type="county">Randolph county</region>
                            </placeName>, through a fine wheat and corn country, passing north of <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Smithfield</settlement>
                            </placeName>, <placeName>

                            </placeName> and <placeName>

                            </placeName>. Winchester is a flourishing county seat, and will no doubt increase in
                            population and business rapidly, and yield a heavy local business when the road shall reach
                            that point. From Winchester the road runs to Union at the state line, about ten miles, where
                            it connects with the <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Pittsburg</settlement>
                            </placeName>, <placeName>

                            </placeName> line. Union is a new town at the junction of these railroads; and as it is ten
                            miles from Winchester and about the same distance from Greenville, it may do considerable
                            business, as it is surrounded by a fine country, and will have the benefit of the
                        railroads.</p>

            <p>The article speaks also of the very low grade of 30′ to the mile which always has been a
                    great advantage for this stretch of road. The section from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> to Pendleton cost $9,359 a mile to construct. (Report of President, February

                        <p>Three trains went up from this city, and each was filled to the utmost. Several addresses
                            were delivered in Anderson but we were too much occupied in getting our dinner to hear them.
                            The only tavern in the place was capable of seating about thirty at a table, and there were
                            about five hundred hungry mortals anxiously awaiting their turn for the privilege of paying
                            for a dinner—we believe every person was accommodated, but some had to wait so
                            long they needed no supper. We heard of several accidents, but no serious ones. The train we

                        <p>The governor [Joseph A. Wright] in his speech drew a comparison of present and past times in
                            the modes of conveyance. He said two whole hours had been required to come to Anderson when
                            within his recollection it took mail carriers three whole days. He urged every one to take
                            stock and aid in the construction. Oliver H. Smith responded, telling of the difficulties in
                            getting the enterprise started, and went into future prospects and benefits the construction

                        <p>That was the day this division of the road was formally opened to traffic, and it was a big
                            feather in Anderson's cap. The train was not one of those swift-flying, luxurious
                            affairs that are the pride of so many great railway corporations of the present time. It
                            consisted of three plain, unvarnished coaches. About it there was a decided absence of show
                            or ornamentation. The seats were not upholstered in satin or <pb n="126" id="VAA4025-021-2-018"/> plush, but were ordinary bench-like affairs. The opening of the
                            road for travel was an event that had long been looked forward to by the people, for when at
                            last an excursion was announced to be run from <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                            </placeName>, the town made preparations for a grand gala day. Many people through this
                            section of the country had never seen a railroad train, and so anxious were they to get a
                            glimpse of the curiosity that for two days before, they rolled into town, some of them
                            coming from long distances. All the boarding houses and hotel accommodations were readily
                            taken, after which strangers began to camp about town waiting the arrival of the train. At
                            the old ford where the iron wagon bridge now spans <geogName>White river</geogName> and the
                            Anderson cemetery there was quite a settlement of sight-seers camped, waiting for the big
                            day to roll around. The curiosity to see the train was not confined to country people;
                            "town folks" were equally as anxious for the appearance of the
                            "covered cars." A number of Andersonians who were acquainted with the lay
                            walked out as far as Omaha, now known as McCullough's gravel pit, between this city
                            and Pendleton, in order to get the first glimpse of the great curiosity. When the steam
                            engine puffed into sight, sizzling and snorting under a load of excursionists, many
                            onlookers viewed the huge iron horse with wonder mingled with mistrust. Suddenly the
                            engineer gave a few vigorous yanks at the whistle which responded promptly in a shrill
                            voice, and that settled the curiosity of the sight-seers scattered along the track. There
                            was a general stampede to the hazel brush and swamp grass, and it is related of one man who
                            was more frightened than the others that he never stopped running until he got to Anderson.
                            The train was received in Anderson with all the "pomp and circumstance" of
                            the times; and after the curiosity of seeing a train of cars had worn away, the people
                            joined hands and had a big celebration.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>

            <p>Unfortunately for Winchester, there were "crooks" in those days as well as today.
                    Some men who had an option on some land north of Winchester, and also an influence with the

                    route a mile and a half north of the main part of Winchester and through the land on which these men
                    held an option. <quote rend="blockquote">

                    the regulator was heavily weighted and the pressure was not known.</p>

                    the road to Union City: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The road ran a free excursion from Union City to <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                            </placeName> and hundreds of citizens availed themselves of the opportunity of taking a free
                            ride, at the same time visiting for the first time the capital of their state. The excursion
                            started about midnight and people went for miles to meet the train. No stations were
                            established, and the trains were stopped anywhere upon being flagged. This was true of the
                            road for a great many years. All one had to do to stop the train was to flag it in the
                            daytime with any kind of a flag, or wave a light at night. The story is told that a little
                            after daylight a woman came running out on the track waving her apron; the engineer stopped
                            the train and the woman said to the conductor: "John wants to go, but he
                            hasn't finished his breakfast; just wait on him a few minutes and he will be
                            ready." We don't know what the conductor said, but John took the trip,
                            just the same. No coaches were on this train, simply flat cars were used and boards placed
                            across the top of the side-boards for seats. Some of the cars had branches of trees put over
                            them to provide a shade. This was a wonderful experience in the history of the county as
                            well as the experience of the people who made the first trip. For many years a regular
                            schedule was almost impossible; a train would come "about" on time,
                            usually the "about" ended by the train being about two or three hours
                                late.<hi rend="sup">31</hi>

            <p>Mr. Love remembers well these "good old days" and their difficulties. They had a
                    telegraph, with stations in the principal towns along the route, and dispatchers to keep up with
                    progress of the train by telegraph as it passed these stations; but there were no telephones along
                    the route for the conductor, as at present, no block signals, and single instead of double tracks.</p>

                    <p>When it came night before we reached a certain station, we would lay over on the first convenient

                        they could hold up trains from the other direction until we got there. Sometimes, when they
                        would notice our train was late they would send a light engine (an engine and tender without any

                    flanged wheels for travel on rails. However, they used hand brakes exclusively, and these had to be
                    operated by the train crew. The cars were connected by draw-bars which were often difficult to
                    adjust on account of the lack of uniformity in car and draw-bar construction; and later by links and
                    pins. The draw-bar and link and pin had to be connected and disconnected by the train crew, and the
                    running between cars thus required caused a great many accidents. Naturally Mr. Love has the highest
                    of praise for the air brake and automatic coupler. When flat cars were loaded with lumber or some
                    other material that projected over the sides, the brake had to be adjusted in such a manner that it
                    was useless.</p>
            <quote rend="blockquote">
                    <p>These couplings were flimsy, and we never knew when one of them would break. In my early days of
                        railroading we had a clothesline running from the caboose to the locomotive and attached to a
                        gong, so it would ring the gong if the train broke in two and the engineer could stop. We
                        carried a supply of links and pins in the caboose for emergency purposes, and had signals, so we
                        could let the man at the back end of the train know how many links or pins we wanted; then he
                        could get them from the caboose and meet us half way, thus saving considerable time. In the
                        winter snow-drifts added to our troubles, and we would be snow-bound at times for quite a while.
                        You can imagine the time we had "wooding up" the tender in a snow-drift.</p>

            <p>It is even handed down in tradition that at a certain pool along the road the train crews would stop
                    long enough to take a swim, and that sometimes they took along their "women folks"
                    and stopped the train while the latter gathered blackberries. The crudeness of the trains of that
                    period is well illustrated by the following from <hi rend="i">Locomotive,</hi> August 13, 1853:

            <p>Unfortunately, few records of the company appear to have been preserved, so we are forced to rely

                    dollars worth of stock had been subscribed, and later, when the contract for laying the track
                    between Chesterfield and Union City was let to Daniel Yandes and Alfred Harrison, the amount was
                    made payable in the stock of the company.<hi rend="sup">32</hi> The company's statement,
                    published in <hi rend="i">Locomotive,</hi> May 3, 1851, shows freight receipts, $3729,
                    and passenger receipts, $2278, with a gross tonnage of over 11,000,000 pounds. The report
                    for May, published in <hi rend="i">Locomotive,</hi> June 7, 1851, shows total receipts of
                    $6,669, a gross tonnage of 9,817,228 pounds, including 56,662 bushels of wheat and 5841
                    barrels of flour. The number of passengers carried was 5976. As practically all this business then
                    was with Pendelton, we may figure the average rate on freight was about four cents on the hundred
                    pounds, a mere fraction of the rate today, though the cost of nearly everything then and now holds
                    about the same proportion. After the road had been completed and through railroad passage to <placeName>

                            the merits of their respective candidates, General Winfield Scott and Franklin Pierce.</p>
                        <p>For days rumors had come and rumors had gone by way of the "grapevine
                            telegraph" among the citizens of the county, "moss-legs" and
                            "web-foots", as they were then derisively termed by their neighbors in the

                                <country reg="le">Lebanon</country>
                            </placeName>. However, the day finally came when rumor took a back seat and reality got on
                            the wire with the result that on the aforesaid morning a good crowd had assembled at the
                            little twelve-by-eighteen-foot shanty on South <placeName>
                                <country reg="le">Lebanon</country>
                            </placeName> street, which served the purposes for a time of a depot, to see the train come
                            in.</p>
                        <p>After much impatient waiting, during which time several disputes had taken place but which
                            had been settled without fatalities, the cry went up that the cars were coming. Everyone
                            began craning his neck and trying to secure a better vantage point when two handcars hove in
                            sight from the west bearing the Irish members of some of the construction gangs.</p>
                        <p>One of the cars of wildly shouting and gesticulating Irishmen bore a hickory pole with the
                            Democratic flag at the top; and the other handcar bore a hickory pole which carried the
                            emblem of the Whig party. Great excitement prevailed for a time among the on-lookers but the
                            crowd soon settled down to waiting.</p>
                        <p>In the meantime, new arrivals, by foot, on horse-back and by big wagon, swelled the assembly
                            and neighbors passed the time conversing and arguing with neighbors and villagers.</p>
                        <p>About 10 o'clock, another cry went up that the cars were coming and this time the
                            crowd was not disappointed. For sure enough, here came "Old <placeName>
                                <region type="county">Boone</region>
                            </placeName>", as the locomotive was called, drawing a number of freight and
                            construction cars, and perhaps a passenger car or two. The entire crowd gave back a distance
                            of thirty to forty feet from the track as the diminutive engine came up puffing and
                            wheezing, for all the world like an old horse with distemper, and came to a stop at the
                            station.</p>
                        <p>As the train came to a stop, the engineer, in a humorous mood took advantage of a few
                            "young bucks", who thought to show their bravery and superiority by
                            remaining near the track and threw hot water on them, much to their discomfort.</p>
                        <p>This was the first official train on the <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>

                            </placeName> railroad, as it was then called, to come to <placeName>

                            </placeName>. After the people found that there was no danger in getting closer to the
                            train, they swarmed over it for a near up inspection. The citizens remained about the train
                            the entire day, learning first hand information concerning what was later to become one of
                            the great assets of modern civilization.</p>
                        <p>However, the day was not to pass without some fighting, and shortly after noon, one of the
                            Irishmen got into a dispute with a prominent <placeName>
                                <country reg="le">Lebanon</country>
                            </placeName> citizen and soon came to blows. Within a short time half a dozen fights were in
                            progress and, as the town had no marshal, threatened <pb n="153" id="VAA4025-021-2-049"/> to
                            become a riot. All of the Irish joined together against the citizens and things continued at
                            a great pace. The affair came to a stop, however, after an Irishman had wielded a knife,
                            almost disemboweling the prominent citizen.</p>
                        <p>It may be said here in passing, that practically all of the construction labor on the road
                            was done by the Irish and they were a wild, hard-drinking, hard-fisted set in those days.</p>
                        <p>The rest of the day passed peacefully and without ceremony, and so far as can be learned,
                            there was no speech-making, or anything of that sort.</p>

                            should have a year or two in which to settle, the work of laying the ties and track did not
                            commence until in 1852. This was begun at <placeName>

                            </placeName> and carried Indianapolisward. The first train reached Thorntown, eight miles
                            from <placeName>

                            </placeName>, about a month earlier, some time in July, and was made an occasion for much

            <p>According to <hi rend="i">Locomotive,</hi> September 11, 1852, the company was "laying iron

                        <country reg="le">Lebanon</country>
                    </placeName> at the rate of two miles a week", and all the grading was done
                    "except a little in this city which will be finished in a few weeks". Two miles a
                    week in those days was considered very fast work, and the writer once discussed this with J. W.
                    Burt, maintenance of way engineer on the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> division of the Big Four which includes the line of the old <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and L. M. Denney, a maintenance of way supervisor with the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> terminal and former president of the Roadmakers' Association. Both agreed that
                    the time in which a given stretch of track can be laid today varies greatly with conditions, not the
                    least of which is the willingness and aptitude of the workers; "however," said Mr.
                    Denney, "on the Bee Line, under the most advantageous conditions, we once laid track at the
                    rate of six miles a week." This shows that, varied as conditions may be, there has been
                    great improvement in this department of railroading. "It would be interesting,"
                    said Mr. Burt, "if it were possible to analyze the construction costs then and now and see
                    if we are more efficient; but the variation in conditions makes this impossible." However,
                    there is plenty of evidence to show the greater efficiency <pb n="154" id="VAA4025-021-2-050"/> of
                    today, even if it is impossible, as Mr. Burt says, to make an accurate and scientific comparison.
                    Construction costs then were about $12,500 to $15,000 a mile, whereas, they
                    would not be more than double that amount now except under the most extraordinary conditions. Rail
                    is approximately double the cost of the old days, being of steel and practically twice as heavy.
                    Today, ties are of carefully selected white oak, brought from a long distance at many times the cost
                    of the old ties, which were hewed in a forest adjacent to the road, at a cost of less than twenty
                    cents apiece.<hi rend="sup">70</hi> Laborers then could be hired for about a dollar a day, while now
                    three to four dollars a day would be a more accurate figure. Gravel for ballast could then be hauled
                    to the track and spread by people who thus worked out subscriptions; for the road, while now ballast
                    is bought at an expensive price and dumped on the track from specially constructed ballast cars.
                    Besides, the science of railway accounting has greatly progressed since 1852; then, no doubt, only
                    the actual construction expenses were counted, while now the office expense of construction is
                    added, and it must also take its share of the distribution of various overhead expenses. Again, the
                    switches and crossings of 1851 were rather; crude; but today, with such appurtenances as frogs,
                    guard rails, switch points, tie plates, special heat-treated bolts, and the like, all of which are
                    necessary to withstand the strain of modern traffic, the? cost of switches and crossings is today
                    perhaps one-third to two-fifths the cost of an entire stretch of railroad.</p>

                            and did not last very long when put in use. The rails were laid end to end on the

                    public praise. He sponsored a bill in congress in the early part of the Civil war to free the slaves

                    over to the State Treasurer for use of the common schools". The route selected was slightly

                            construction amounted to $3524.47½. There was one cut of 5 feet, one
                            embankment of 5½ feet, a curve and two bridges on the road. The oak rails were

                    yard, was "purchased and on its way." It was hoped to have the entire road ready
                    for the superstructure the next season, for which means had been provided with the exception of

                        <p>Shall this state of affairs continue? Shall nothing be done to counteract what is going on,

                            </placeName>? A knowledge of the railway systems of Indiana suggests the remedy. That system
                            exhibits the remarkable feature of concentration of nearly all the railways of the state
                            between two points—<placeName>

                            </placeName> needs is a direct communication with these points. She wants a connection with
                            both, and fortunately they are so situated that she needs but one line to effect but that
                            object. In 83 miles she reaches <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Shelbyville</settlement>
                            </placeName> and connects with three railroads all in use. Another will be made of 15 miles

                            </placeName> where it connects with the road to Martinsville, 26 miles now making. In all,
                            at least 100 miles of railroad unite at this point and it is 10 miles nearer <placeName>

                            </placeName>. Here are five roads making—one to <placeName>

                            </placeName>, which will be completed the first of December; one to <placeName>

                            </placeName>, to be finished next year; one to Peru, under contract to be completed within
                            the same time; one to the state line at Union, called the Bellefontaine road, also expected
                            to be finished in another year. Another is projected east to <placeName>

                            </placeName>. All of these roads will average nearly 75 miles each, making of themselves 350
                            miles of road, but arrangements are making to extend them in various

                        <p>The nucleus of the future city of Batesville consisted in 1852 of two stores,
                            Thoman's on the north side and Kipper's on the south side of the railway
                            right of way. A few scattered farmhouses made up the rest of the settlement. With the
                            surveying and building of the railroad, a station was located near the two stores.
                            Batesville was laid out November 3, 1852, by John Callahan, J. H. Sprague, Joseph Groff,
                            Joshua Bates and George H. Dunn. The <placeName>

                            </placeName> was completed across Adams and Lougheer townships in 1852. A saw-mill was the
                            chief industry of the new town at this date. The land is principally level and swampy and
                            was covered with hardwood forests. The saw-milling industry expanded and finally developed
                            into wood-carving, furniture and casket manufactures. At this date, January, 1924, the city
                            claims about three thousand inhabitants and manufacturing plants valued at several millions
                            of dollars.</p>
                        <p>The land for the railroad was given by the farmers owning it, the company paying for it only
                            by free passes on the new road for a year or possibly two years. The workmen were boarded in
                            the farm homes along the right of way and stables were built for the oxen required in the
                            heavy hauling.</p>
                        <p>There being no town organizations in Huntersville or the newer town of Batesville, named for
                            one of its founders, Joshua Bates, the scattered settlers could take no united action except
                            to give their land and as much accommodation as possible to the workmen. Undoubtedly many of
                            them worked on the road but our oldest inhabitants with two or three exceptions, if born
                            here at all, were born about 1852 or 1853, coincident with the completion of the road. Of
                            the few born earlier, Mrs. Catharine Hinnenkamp, who came to this locality in 1842 as a
                            child of five years, has furnished considerable data. She accompanied her father, Mr. Zies,

                        <p>When two trains ran against each other on the same line of track, they would start from
                            opposite directions and run to a post painted white, which was usually set half way between
                            two station points. If one arrived first they waited a half hour, and if the opposite train
                            did not put in its appearance the first train arriving at the central white post would take
                            chances and sneak in, but frequently had to back up, as they would meet the belated train
                            midway. Many times the throttle would not work and steam could not be shut off in time to
                            stop the train; and in such cases the engineer had to open up his pumps from the tanks and
                            fill his boiler up with cold water in order to reduce the steam so the locomotive would stop
                            for want of power.<hi rend="sup">119</hi> If a train was supposed to carry 15 freights it

                        <p>Locomotives of the time were frequently painted in gaudy colors, bright red, blue and green.
                            The names were engraved on the engine in conspicuous places. The most common type of
                            locomotive had four large wheels in the rear and four small ones in front. Enormous smoke
                            stacks were characteristic of the period. The earlier passenger cars were short and brightly
                            decorated or carved.</p>
                    </quote>It may be explained that large smoke stacks were necessary to secure proper draft on the

                    pressure about three times as great as on the engines of seventy years ago, a short stack suffices.
                    Mr. Blank's references to the names being engraved on the locomotives calls to mind once

            <p>Dr. B. F. Shambaugh, speaking before the Indiana History Conference in 1922, referred to the middle
                    period of American history which began at the close of the Revolution and ended about 1870. He spoke
                    of the history of Indiana coming well within that period; and the railroad building in that period
                    and the period which followed shows widely different characteristics. It may be said that the middle
                    period in Indiana railroad history ended with the Civil war, and the roads which were built
                    subsequently did not have the pioneer glamour of the building of the earlier ones. The chief
                    characteristics of the later period are hectic financing and its consequences.</p>

                        <p>In those days a railroad president had the power of a king. Rates were made and unmade
                            overnight. If one railroad wanted to buy another, the deal was made public when the
                            presidents involved so desired and not sooner. To go to the government to get permission to
                            issue new bonds or stock was as unheard of as asking for authority to change a freight rate.
                            If the records are consulted as far back as the days of Jay Gould it will be found that
                            railroads changed hands mostly for stock jobbing purposes. In the days of Cassatt control of
                            railroads was acquired wholesale to stop freight rate cutting. Harriman bought up one
                            railroad after another for the power it gave his own road, the Union Pacific.</p>
                    </quote>This was characteristic of railroads all over the west and middle west especially; and if
                    some of the railroad finance described in the following sketches seems wildly speculative and
                    foolhardy, it must be remembered that it was the financing characteristic of the time; and that
                    where roads in Indiana went into bankruptcy, under more auspicious conditions men like James J. Hill

            <p>Dr. Logan Esarey in his <hi rend="i">History of Indiana,</hi> has well analyzed the fundamental cause
                    for the railroad troubles in the state following the Civil war. He speaks of the great expansion in
                    railroads from 1850 to 1860, and then the great expansion in agriculture from 1860 to 1880, due to
                    the improvements in farm machinery and the large number of men coming back from the Civil war and
                    going to work on the farms. There was a steady decline in prices after the Civil war, and this
                    decline was general in farm produce, since he produced statistics to show that the amount of
                    agricultural products for the country at large averaged from two to three times as much in 1880 as
                    it was in 1860.</p>
            <quote rend="blockquote">
                    <p>On the other hand freight rates refused to respond to the general decline. Tempted by the rush of
                        settlers to the northwest, the railroads, having extended their lines farther than sound
                        business would warrant, found it necessary to hold rates up or go bankrupt, and many did
                    both.</p>

            <p>J. Q. Van Winkle, assistant to the vice-president of the Big Four, spoke of the over-expansion of

            <quote rend="blockquote">

                        remember when one combination freight and passenger train a day each way took care of all the
                        business on the Bellefontaine between here and Union City, and this was true of other roads as
                        well.</p>

            <p>By keeping pace with the development of the territory it serves, according to Mr. Van Winkle, the Big
                    Four does about eight times the business it did even when it was first organized in 1889, with the
                    same lines of road.</p>
            <p>So, it will be the writer's purpose to feature chiefly the "frenzied
                    finance" in the building of the roads covered by the following sketches. They lack some of
                    the romance of the pioneer period, but they have romance—for there is a sort of
                    "over the hills and far away" fascination to railroading which makes it a romantic
                    subject at any time or period.</p>

                    shares of $100 each. The directors were seven in number, the first directorate being
                    William Dwight, Henry C. Lord, Robert M. Shoemaker, Thomas A. Morris, John A. Farquhar, James Gaff,

            <p>The financial statement of February 1, 1870, shows the desperate straits of the company.<hi rend="sup">29</hi> The capital stock was $5,685,497.50 (probably some of this stock
                    was watered), and the funded debt had reached the enormous total of $7,358,-931.36. The
                    total earnings for the year had been $1,921,-274.26, but operating expenses, taxes, etc.,
                    were $1,213,781.31, and interest had been paid on bonds and bills amounting to
                    $538,511.18. This left less than $200,000, whereas bills payable came to
                    $475,628.51, and "other liabilities", $200,000. The

            <p>The road went into the hands of receivers early in 1871, to be followed by two suits in bankruptcy
                    against it within a very short time. The first was the petition of J. F. Richardson, et al., filed
                    May 5, 1871. In this petition the following claims were presented for adjudication: A note of the
                    company for $4061.84 to the order of Joel F. Richardson, a note of the company for
                    $16,300 to Henry C. Lord and indorsed by him to Zephaniah Heustis, and 18 notes or
                    vouchers ranging from $3100 to $12,000 each, payable to Eri Richardson. The
                    petitioners alleged that the company had committed the following acts of bankruptcy:</p>
            <list type="ordered">
               <item>On November 17, 1870, assets of the value of more than $2,000,000 to be and being

                        the bankruptcy act.</item>
               <item>About August 25, 1871, in order to satisfy a debt they owed to the Whitewater Valley Railroad
                        company for about $60,000, they transferred "certain assets of the
                        company" consisting of $10,000 in cash, various supplies of the company,
                        which were listed in detail amounting to about $20,000, a claim of about
                        $20,000 against Greenwood and Smith, a large number of engines and cars leased to
                        them for three months without cost, and materials and supplies given to them for use
                        "with intent to give preference to the said Whitewater Valley railroad and to defeat
                        the operation of said bankruptcy act."</item>
               <item>From March 1, 1871, to the end of April, 1871, the company's property in the State of
                        Indiana was taken in by receivers, Thomas A. Morris and Melville E. Ingalls, appointed by the

                        Zephaniah Heustis.</item>
               <item>The company, being insolvent, made a payment of $20,913.41 to the executors of

            <p>The petition of the city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>, filed July 3, 1871, is much shorter and simpler. The city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> had issued $25,000 worth of bonds at 6% interest, payable in
                    twenty years, and dated February 15, 1851, for 558 shares of the capital stock of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>; mention of this issue was made in the sketch on the early history of that road. The
                    company later bought back 556, or all but two, of these shares, under the conditions that it was to
                    keep up the interest on the bonds and to deliver them at maturity to the city. Meanwhile, the bonds
                    matured February 15, 1871, the company failed to redeem them, and the city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> had some interest to pay on them. The city took up one of the bonds for
                    $1000 from a Mrs. Moore, in order that they could proceed in bankruptcy against the
                            <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Its principal allegation was that on June 5, 1871, a petition to remove the receivers
                    was set aside by the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion</region>
                    </placeName> civil court, continuing the receivers in possession of the property "with
                    intent to delay, hinder and defraud its creditors." The road filed denials of both
                    petitions, of that of J. F. Richardson, et al., on May 12, 1871, and that of the city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> on July 12, 1871. John F. Richards, as mayor, acted for the city of <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The case was a long and bitterly fought one, and the pleadings and evidence may be found in book form
                    in the Indiana State library. Walter Q. Gresham, later secretary of state under President <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>

                    of the company. It owed $800,000 in bills payable, besides some "open,
                    unadjusted accounts", a mortgage issued in 1858 for $1,500,000 on the line from <placeName>

                    </placeName>, a mortgage of $2,800,000 made in 1867 covering the line from state line to <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, issued in 1868 for $2,000,000, besides two mortgages aggregating
                    $2,500,000 of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>. All these mortgages had trustees, being made to secure bond issues. The following
                    testimony shows the troubles the company was having: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Q. State whether at that time in October (Oct. 10), 1870, the company was in possession of
                            means to pay its pay roll—its operatives—according to the usual habit.</p>
                        <p>A. Pay-day had been postponed, I think, in October. The treasurer may have had the money, but
                            if so, it was needed for other purposes—to save the company from
                            protest—and was applied to other purposes than the payment of the men.</p>
                        <p>Q. Were the operatives of the road paid in October at the time they were payable, and usually
                            paid?</p>
                        <p>A. I think not.</p>
                        <p>Q. What did the pay roll amount to?</p>
                        <p>A. It was from fifty to sixty thousand dollars a month.</p>
                        <p>Q. Calling your attention to the mortgage liability of the company, state whether or not the
                            company was in default in the payment of interest on its coupons.</p>
                        <pb n="202" id="VAA4025-021-2-100"/>
                        <p>A. Up to that time, there was a large amount of unpaid coupons, but they were not protested;
                            they were held back and not presented, by agreement. My recollection is that the amount of
                            the coupons at that time was about $175,000 dollars.</p>
                        <p>Q. State whether they were held back from the inability of the company to meet them.</p>
                        <p>A. It was, by agreement.</p>
                        <p>Q. Did the company have the money to pay them when they came due, when the agreement was
                            made?</p>
                        <p>A. Probably the correct answer to that would be that when the agreement to have the coupons
                            held back was made, the money was desired for other purposes. It was a way of making a loan.
                            The company, if it had been pressed, could probably have paid them off by borrowing money or
                            leaving somebody else unpaid.</p>
                        <p>Q. State whether, during the last two or three months preceding the month of October, 1870,
                            the corporation was borrowing money in the city of <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                            </placeName> from various banks or bankers.</p>
                        <p>A. She was.</p>
                        <p>Q. To a large or small extent?</p>
                        <p>A. Some days she would borrow five thousand, some days as much as twenty-five and on some
                            occasions even as high as thirty or forty thousand dollars.</p>
                        <p>Q. At what rate of interest?</p>
                        <p>A. On the smaller loans—say of five, ten or fifteen thousand
                            dollars—she paid as high as one per cent a month.</p>
                        <p>Q. State whether the loans were call loans or loans on time.</p>
                        <p>A. They were of both kinds. Sometimes there was a commission to be paid, besides the
                            interest.</p>
                        <p>Q. Did there have to be indorsements furnished?</p>
                        <p>A. Always.</p>
                        <p>Q. Who mainly was furnished as indorser by the company?</p>
                        <p>A. At <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                            </placeName> Mr. Lord was the indorser.</p>
                        <p>Q. Exclusively?</p>
                        <p>A. I might say exclusively.</p>
                        <p>Q. For what use was the money necessary, and to what use was it applied?</p>
                        <p>A. Mainly to carry the floating debt.</p>
                        <p>Q. Explain what you mean by carry.</p>
                        <p>A. We would borrow from one bank to pay another.</p>
                        <p>Q. For what length of time had that continued prior to October, 1870—this habit of
                            borrowing from one party to pay off another?</p>
                        <p>A. The operation of "shinning", as we call it there, had been going on for
                            two or three years.</p>

            <p>The move to go voluntarily into the hands of a receiver, according to testimony introduced, was

            <p>In support of the second count, the transaction with the Whitewater Valley company, the petitioners
                    introduced as evidence the agreement of January 26, 1871, between the <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
               </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in the hands of receivers, and the Whitewater Valley Railroad company, which read in
                    part as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Now therefore to avoid these dangers (threat of bankruptcy and legal proceedings), which are
                            regarded as ruinous to both parties, and enable the party of the first part (the

                            </placeName>) to avoid bankruptcy and the party of the second part (the Whitewater Valley)
                            to regain possession of its railroad and to procure rolling stock, the said parties have
                            mutually agreed to cancel said lease and all the covenants therein contained.</p>
                    </quote>The cancellation of the lease, it was stipulated, <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>shall in no wise effect the right of the party of the second part to the unpaid rent which
                            shall be due and in arrears on said lease on the first of February next.</p>
                    </quote>The language of this agreement was so plain that the defense could not very well refute it,
                    but they answered that the claim they held against Greenwood and Smith was of doubtful value, and
                    that they thought the Whitewater Valley people could better collect it.</p>
            <p>Some contention was raised over the fourth count, that the company, "being a
                    manufacturer," suspended payment on a note in question. However, in those days, there was a
                    manufacturer's tax to be paid to the federal government; and the petitioners showed that
                    the company had built cars for Dodge, Lord and company, and introduced the deposition of Deputy
                    Collector of Internal Revenue Brackett, of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> district, to the effect that the company had paid for a manufacturer's license
                    and also a tax on manufacturer's sales. They were to be considered a manufacturer, Mr.
                    Brackett said, even if they <pb n="204" id="VAA4025-021-2-102"/> built cars or locomotives for their
                    own use, and were taxed the same as if they had sold them.</p>
            <p>The matter of the payment to the Longworth estate concerned nine tracts of ground in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> used for tracks and various other railroad purposes. The leases contained provisions
                    that in case the rent was not kept up, the estate had a first lien on the property and could
                    re-enter it. The rent was kept up by the company, especially as some of the tracts contained
                    facilities used jointly with other roads, which would lead to serious consequences in case of
                    forfeiture and re-entry by the Longworth heirs.</p>
            <p>The defense introduced evidence to try to discredit the claims of the petitioners, and much of it was
                    directed at Henry C. Lord, president before the receivership. Joel F. Richardson had been paid his
                    salary as superintendent according to Alexander Worth, secretary and later auditor for the
                    receivers; and he said he supposed the notes at issue were for his operation of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> road. Asked about this Mr. Richardson testified as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>I rented the track of Mr. Branham (the builder) in the first place. Mr. Branham asked me if

                            they could not; but I consulted with Mr. Lord and he said that it could not be done on any
                            consideration. I asked him the reason, and he said there were contracts that would not allow
                            the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                     </placeName> and <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                            </placeName> road to put their cars on there or run them. I then told him the
                                    <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>

                            </placeName> road ought to secure the business on that line as much as possible; and I then
                            asked him if he would rent me the rolling stock to run it at a fair rate, and he told me
                            that he would. Then I entered into an agreement with Branham &amp; Co. to run the road,
                            and the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                     </placeName> and <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                            </placeName> road furnished me an engine and some passenger and freight cars. I made the
                            agreement with Mr. Lord that the business of the <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                            </placeName> road should be done at our office by our general ticket and freight agents. I
                            ran the road, then, until probably February or March, 1869. The road was in bad condition,
                            and it was wet weather and I saw we were not making much, or not making anything. I saw the
                            road was very bad, and if I happened to ditch a train it would be pretty heavy on me. I said
                            to Mr. Lord: "I am going to give this thing up; I will go and see Branham and tell
                            him I do not want to run it any longer." I told Mr. Lord I was <pb n="205" id="VAA4025-021-2-103"/> discouraged; that I was afraid I would make a mishap, run off
                            the track or something of the kind that would cost me a good deal of money. Mr. Lord then
                            said: "This company needs the business, and if you will continue to run it I will
                            back you." Said I: "Do I understand you to say, that you will stand the
                            losses with me?" "Yes," said he. "Well, then,"
                            said I, "you shall have half the profits." Then I went ahead and ran the
                            road until the track was connected under that arrangement—till the track was
                            finished from <placeName>

            <p>The witness testified that he and Mr. Lord had at the time "pretty much" settled
                    their accounts; the profits due them, handled by the financial department of the
                            <placeName>

                    </placeName>, amounted to about $26,000 paid in notes. The witness thought he had
                    indorsed over to Mr. Lord enough to pay his share, all of them being made payable to him; and one of
                    these notes, for $13,000, after Mr. Lord's share had been given him, called for
                    payment of 10% interest, the witness "guessed."</p>
            <p>Judge Hoadly, for the defense, introduced as evidence a lease given by the road to J. F. Richardson,
                    whereby he was given a monopoly on the coal to be furnished to the road, from his privately owned
                    elevator at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and preferential rates in shipping material over its line. Such a lease today would be

                    years service to his credit, was a drinker and gambler and had endeavored to interest his fellow

            <p>The notes to Eri Richardson were for wood supplied to the company for their wood-burning locomotives.
                    He had a contract to furnish wood at $3.00 a cord for the line from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>

                    </placeName> and Martinsville sections, and to furnish cross ties for the road at 35c each, which
                    contract was somewhat elastic in that it allowed for a small advance in price. The testimony of
                    several men who sold him wood for the road did not prove anything of importance, but evidence was
                    introduced to show that Mr. Richardson had bought several hundred acres of land from Henry C. Lord
                    for $13,500, though it was mostly woods and its value was estimated at only about
                    $20 an acre at the time. Therefore, collusion was hinted at between Richardson and Lord,
                    and the defense contended that the "claim was so large that it could not be
                    honest."</p>
            <p>In connection with this wood contract, the testimony of Alexander Worth, former secretary of the
                    company, and at the time auditor for the receivers, is interesting and is partially reproduced:
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Q. You never told them (the men that sold the wood) that Mr. Richardson was buying their

                        <p>A. Of course not. We had padlocks on our mouths all the time about these things.</p>

                        <p>A. This corporation has been a close corporation for years—that is a thing
                            understood. That close corporation was made by the stockholders themselves. I was positively
                            forbidden to make known to anybody the contents of my books; I was simply to do my clerical
                            duties.</p>
                        <p>Q. Who put the padlock on your lips?</p>
                        <p>A. Proxies were given every year, and to my astonishment, throwing the whole control of this
                            company and of the road into one man's hands and making it a one-man power. It
                            seemed as if there was a fatality about it; it seemed strange that while these men knew that
                            they were receiving no reports—full, itemized, extensive reports of the doings of
                            this company that had been repeatedly promised them, they still gave their proxies, all
                            combining to establish a certain course of operating the road, one feature of which was:
                            "You operators of the road keep quiet; be still; say nothing; we are in trouble; we
                            are in financial difficulty." That was about it. Out of this thing there grew a
                            close corporation, "known and read of all men" that were interested in
                            this company directly or indirectly.</p>
                        <p>Q. You mean that the company was insolvent and wanted to keep it quiet?</p>

                        <p>Q. Is that what you mean or not?</p>
                        <p>A. Yes, sir.</p>

                            that it?</p>

                        <p>Q. Suppose you tell us. You say, for the purpose of keeping that threatened insolvency and
                            that financial embarrassment of the company quiet, you were to keep still—is that
                            the idea?</p>

                        <p>A. Yes, sir; it was not a literal padlock, but a metaphorical padlock.</p>

            <p>It will be seen that the earnings were large, but that taxes and interest were making such inroads on
                    the finances that a deficit of $9500.51 had been increased to $22,762.29 by
                    the year's work. In fact, taxes had increased $9,616.05, interest on the
                    floating debt $8,230.27 and bonded interest $36,000. The troubles the company
                    was having with taxes reminds one of the high railroad taxes of today. The taxes of some roads
                    amount to almost as much as their dividends, and Mr. C. R. Myers, general agent for the Big Four,
                    says that 55,000 passenger fares to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> are necessary to pay the annual taxes for that road in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Indiana, alone.</p>
            <p>The road in 1875 had 1160 cars, consisting of 727 box cars, 49 stock cars, 66 coal cars, 289 flat
                    cars, 2 tool cars, 2 camp cars and 25 caboose cars. During the year it had renewed 85,300
                    cross-ties, had laid five and one-fourth miles of steel rails (they were just coming into use then),
                    which made twenty-seven and one-half miles of steel rail in the company's tracks, and they
                    renewed twenty-four miles of iron. The extra cost of four hundred and fifty-one tons of steel over
                    an equal amount of iron was $9,259, and besides, the cost of new side tracks for the year
                    past was $2649.</p>
            <p>Some interesting facts about the equipment at the time is revealed in various places in the report of
                    the evidence in the bankruptcy case. The value of locomotives then in use was placed at
                    $4000 to $5000 apiece; "now a standard Big Four freight engine costs
                    $71,725 and a standard passenger engine $61,200," says Mr. Myers.
                    Second class passenger cars were worth only about $2500 apiece and baggage cars which had
                    been "used a good while" were worth $1700. Freight rates then were
                    still much lower than those of today. J. F. Richardson testified that under his supervision of the <placeName>

                    rate of only twelve and a half cents to the hundred pounds, far below the present rates for any

                    discussed later in the sketch. The company's report, January 10, 1868, to the secretary of
                    state showed an expenditure of $4,688.31 for preliminary surveys; and this amount had
                    been increased to $15,075.82 by January 9, 1869. General T. A. Morris, prominently
                    mentioned in connection with other roads, was the president, and E. King, the secretary.</p>
            <p>The year 1869, when the road was actually started, was a notable one in railroading. The greatest
                    railroad event of the year was driving the last spike in the first great transcontinental railroad,
                    now the Union Pacific. However, many lesser events were transpiring. It was a time of great, almost
                    feverish, railroad expansion; and this, as has been noticed, became over-expansion. Railroads were
                    beginning to be merged into great systems, with all their evils and advantages, and men like
                    Commodore Vanderbilt and Jay Gould were making their huge fortunes in railroads. The newspapers of
                    1869 often speak of the effect on competing roads of the Vanderbilt control of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> Central and the Laifre Shore. With the expansion in lines of road was a development in
                    railroad material and equipment. Steel rail was beginning to take the place of iron rail, though
                    not, as a rule, any heavier to the yard. The <placeName>

                    and this often mentioned new railroad inventions. Some were practical and in use today, like the use

                    was a device to make the red signal on a switchstand appear, due to electrical contact, when a
                    switch had been misplaced (this idea was perhaps the forerunner of the electric block signal of
                    today). Another was a warning gong to be kept ringing constantly while the train was in motion,
                    placed on the front of the engine, and struck by a hammer which was kept moving back and forth by
                    the motion of the eccentric on the locomotive. This reminds one somewhat of the
                    "bob-light" used a few years later on the Bellefontaine—a light set in
                    the sky-light of the caboose, which was kept alternately visible and invisible by means of a
                    shutter, which worked up and down on a cam operated by the motion of the axle. It was easy to tell
                    from the cab of the engine or from behind the train whether the rear of the train was still in
                    motion—an important matter before air brakes and air-hose couplings came into vogue. It
                    was understood, though never verified, that the "bob-light" was abandoned by the
                    Bellefontaine due to differences with the inventor.</p>

                        <p>Sometime in the late sixties, the railroad gradually oozing westward, came through the
                            southeast corner of Parke county. A man by the name of J. B. Cochran, seeing the strategic
                            point, where a railroad crossed a wagon-road in a neighborhood rich in virgin timber,
                            foresaw a future city. He promptly built a store and was appointed agent for the railroad.
                            He nailed a neat board labelled ‘Cochran's Station’, over the
                            station door and dreamed he had founded a city. The tiny town was laid out in city blocks
                            and lots in 1870, and many buildings were erected. The principal industry was sawing and
                            shipping lumber and staves from the adjoining forests.</p>
                        <p>One fatal day the train stopped long enough for a railroad official to hand over a new
                            signboard, and instruct some of the interested bystanders to nail it over the station door.
                            On this was printed ‘Lena’, and thus the town was named and
                            ‘Cochran's Station’ was known no more.</p>

                            was connected with some of the gay soldier lads stationed at Old Fort Harrison on the

            <p>The road was aided, like all the new roads of the period in Indiana, by grants of land and township

                    ahead. All that happened was that Mr. Hadley climbed tranquilly aboard the train. The conductor said
                    to him with some asperity, "This train is not supposed to stop except at regular scheduled
                    stops." "Well, it stopped, didn't it?" returned the old <placeName>

            <p>Methods of operation on railroads during the early seventies did not change a great deal from those

                    </placeName>. There was some improvement, however, in equipment. Engines were larger; the sand dome,
                    from which sand can be applied to the track if it is slippery, was coming into use; and the engine
                    truck, running on four smaller wheels and supporting the front of the engine, was being used on
                    engines as well as the four main driver wheels. Fred Dancey, an <placeName>

                        <p>They had ricks along the road for the wood, and it was sawed in treadmills, operated by
                            horses who kept the shaft moving by walking along it, yet never advancing in position.</p>
                    </quote> Seats were then of hard material, such as cane, but far from being the soft upholstered
                    coach seats of today. Cars were heated by stoves then, and it was necessary to secure them with
                    strong bolts to the floor of the coach on account of the jarring of the train. Mr. Dancey remembers
                    when passenger cars were supported by large springs placed on top of the trucks, and also when large
                    pieces of rubber took the place of springs in supporting the bolsters on which the car body rests.</p>
            <p>The cost of the road and equipment, as given in <hi rend="i">Poor's Manual of Railroads</hi>
                    for 1871–2, was $3,410,003.95; and other assets, such as real estate and
                    buildings, stocks and bonds, fuel, cash and the like, brought the total to $4,076,532.16.
                        <pb n="230" id="VAA4025-021-2-128"/> The capital stock continued at only $600,000,
                    the bulk of the cost being met by bonds secured by two mortgages, both bearing seven per cent
                    interest—a $2,000,000 first mortgage issued July 1, 1869, and a second
                    mortgage of $670,000 issued October 1, 1870. Bills payable were $265,215.69
                    and other liabilities $366,530.59, leaving the company an equity of
                    $174,–785.88. The rail was 60 pound rail, and the gauge of the track
                    4′8½. The following operating statement shows a satisfactory condition for the

            <p>Discouraging as the outlook seemed, with the great mass of unpaid certificates, vouchers and
                    pay-rolls, General George B. Wright, the receiver, took a little satisfaction in the fact that the
                    excess of liabilities over assets had been reduced from $1,250,233.34 in 1877 to
                    $1,107,858.89 in 1878. The expenditures for the four-year period were listed in detail,

            <p>General Wright, who had given the road's affairs considerable thought, made the following
                    comments on the financial conditions in the report for 1878: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The gross earnings for the year have been increased about $60,–000 over
                            the previous year, but the cost of maintaining the property has been increased considerably,
                            by reason of additional repairs rendered necessary from natural wear and decay.</p>
                        <p>The improvement in gross earnings may be attributed in a great measure, to the organization
                            and maintenance of pools at most of the crossings and intersections with other roads. This
                            has, in nearly every case, resulted in the strict observance of tariff rates, and an
                            increased confidence between the managers of the different lines. While the through rates
                            have been extremely low not averaging over 70/100 of a cent per ton per mile, being only
                            about one-third the rate which prevailed four years ago, the local rates have been quite
                            uniform and generally sustained.</p>
                        <p>One great obstacle to the economical management and operation of this line of road is its
                            steep grades. The utmost capacity of an ordinary freight engine over the entire
                            "main line" between <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Pekin</settlement>
                            </placeName> and <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                            </placeName>, is fifteen to eighteen loaded cars, or about one hundred eighty to two hundred
                            tons of freight. The grades between <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Urbana</settlement>
                            </placeName> and <placeName>

                            </placeName> could be reduced at a cost of about $100,000 so that a single engine
                            could haul double this amount of freight between those two points. The two steepest grades
                            on the main line west of <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Urbana</settlement>
                            </placeName> are found at <placeName>

                            expense per annum than the interest on the cost of changing the line and grades.</p>

                        out his mistake. For instance, the master mechanic from the east was not used to the conditions
                        we had to face, made a complete failure and had to go back to the Long Island. He was used to a

                        used copper fire boxes in those days; steel had not been developed as it is now, to stand fire

                        <p>Mr. Davis stated that the company asked the right of way through the county and a subsidy of
                            $4000 per mile. Great interest was shown in the movement, and a committee was
                            appointed with Judge J. H. Mellett as chairman. This committee soon secured the number of
                            names required to petition the county commissioners to appoint days for a special election
                            in <geogName>Blue River</geogName>, Henry and Harrison townships, when the voters should
                            decide for or against the tax to build the road. These petitions were granted by the
                            commissioners and April 26 set as the day to vote. The Henry and <geogName>Blue
                            River</geogName> township voters were favorable to the tax by strong majorities and the
                            Harrison township citizens by a narrow margin, as the proposed line of the road barely

                            Ratcliff, of the <hi rend="i">Courier</hi> staff, who resigned his newspaper position in the

                        <p>As is the case with any improvement involving expense there was a strong element opposed to
                            the construction of the road through the county but they were by no means in the majority.
                            The greatest difficulties encountered in the building of the road were due to the crossing
                            of the Panhandle track about a mile northeast of <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">New Castle</settlement>
                            </placeName> and the long low bottom land in the <geogName>Blue River</geogName> valley just
                            west of the town. This latter required the construction of a trestle, estimated to cost
                            $20,000. The contractors secured 175,000 feet of square oak timber and 75,000
                            feet of yellow pine, the latter being shipped direct from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Memphis</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                     </placeName>, and costing about seventy dollars per thousand feet. This
                            trestle was long the wonder of the country round but in later years was filled.</p>
                        <p>Among interesting items found in the ‘Track and Train’ column of the

                            the track in shape so that the first <pb n="247" id="VAA4025-021-2-145"/> train was run from <placeName>

            <p>Equipment in railroads, by the time the Peoria and Eastern East was built, had progressed

                    Steel rails were used instead of iron, but they were about the same weight, 60 pounds to the yard.
                    The gauge of the road was four feet, nine inches, and the rolling stock was as follows in 1881:
                    Locomotives, 93; passenger cars, 65; baggage, mails and express cars, 33; chair cars, 4; cabooses,
                    45; box cars, 1469; stock cars, 356; coal cars, 669; platform cars, 336.<hi rend="sup">109</hi> One
                    of the main differences in the track then and now was in the switches. The ends of the switches now
                    are tapered off to make a smooth junction with the rail; but in those days the switches had a stub
                    end to them where they came in contact with the rail. Of course, the train made a somewhat jarring
                    motion, but the railroaders of the time were accustomed to it. The switches of the time were all
                    hand-operated; the record of interlockers, marking the introduction of electric block signal
                    apparatus, in the state offices, goes back to 1884, but they did not come into use on the Big Four

                        over a rail joint, and it was clicketey-clack all along the line. The engines wore off the sharp
                        ends of the rails in going over them, and a welder was kept busy all the time filling out the
                        ends of these rails. The track was so loose that when we went over it it looked ahead like a big
                        crooked snake. Later they got fish-plates (these were plain bars which fit in the necks of the
                        rails and were bolted to them through holes punched in the rails) but these were not so secure
                        as the angle bars of today, which are bolted to the rails and also spiked down to the tie.</p>

                    late at the scheduled junction point, the west-way train would have the right of way. Now, east-way
                    trains have the right of way under all conditions. Then, five minutes was allowed for variation of
                    watches, but now conductors and engineers have their watches inspected regularly and adjust them
                    regularly, so that there is practically no such thing now as variation of watches.</p>
            <p>Mr. Webb and Mr. Thompson have seen many improvements on locomotives, but the ones which seem to have
                    impressed them most have been the method of injecting water into the boiler under steam pressure,
                    and the air brakes. After the old period of bailing water into the boiler, a pump was installed on
                    the engine, operated by an arm attached to the cross-head which pumped water from the tender into
                    the boiler; but sometimes, going down hill, it would be found necessary to shut off this pump. Later
                    the steam injectors were substituted, but the first ones were huge, unwieldy things, not like the
                    small, easily-operated ones just under the cab of the modern locomotive. Their railroading began
                    with the era of hand brakes; then they had experience with the first air brakes, in which air
                    pressure was applied to the brakes of the different cars of a train in succession; but this had its
                    difficulties, since the rear part of a train would still be going while the brakes were applied to
                    the cars on the front part. The air brake system of today is based largely upon the triple valve by
                    means of which a balanced pressure is kept against the piston which operates the brakes. If air is
                    let out of the train line by means of the valve in the engine, or by the train breaking in two, this
                    balance is destroyed, the heavier pressure on one side causes the piston in the air reservoir on
                    each car to shove the brakes against the wheels. In this way all parts of the train are stopped
                    almost simultaneously.</p>

                        <p>It had become a fashion of railroad companies controlled by bond-holders to pile up floating

                            and material men, and James M. Butler, of the firm of McDonald and Butler, made a determined
                            fight in this case for a modification of the old equity rule which gave the mortgagee
                            absolute priority in such cases. Judge Drummond recognized the justice of the plea and
                            announced the now celebrated ‘six months rule’, which gave precedence

            <p>This presented a good showing, but the road, in the seven years of plenty, made no provision for the
                    lean years. Every year the surplus which was left was expended on construction, and evidently no
                    dividends were paid on the capital stock. This was likely due to the fact that Captain Wells and his
                    associates expected the Lake Shore to buy the road, which they did not. Again, although the
                    authorized capital stock was $2,250,000, only $1,500,000 was actually paid in.
                    The late seventies were hard years on all railroads; and although operating expenses increased
                    enormously as the road was completed to Anderson, the gross earnings increased but little.</p>

                        <p>I entered the service of this Company May 15, 1870, in construction service with a promise of

                        <p>When we started to lay rails at <placeName>

                            </placeName> they were all iron rails at this time, steel rails were unknown. Iron was
                            $70.00 per ton. Everything went smoothly until we reached <placeName>

                            </placeName>, when we struck a sink hole. This place did not seem to have any bottom; after
                            working all day, everything would look all right, but by morning rails and ties would be out
                            of sight. There were no <list type="footnotes">

                            what were called chairs, the chairs being spiked to the ties with three spikes, so we lost
                            some rails.</p>
                        <p>We cut and put into this place ten acres of tamarack, one hundred and fifty carloads of old
                            ties from the L. S. &amp; M. S. railroad, and all of the dirt that could be gotten

                            </placeName>. There were no agents, all fares being collected on the train. When the local
                            freight pulled in the drays backed up to the car door and the conductor would check out the
                            freight and charge just what he thought it would stand, no record of anything.</p>
                        <p>By this time I was beginning to be considered an old hand and whenever there was anything
                            special to do some of the officials would say ‘Where is Haydon?’ This
                            began to look encouraging. If the fireman was sick or wanted to lay off, it was
                            ‘Get Haydon’; if there had to be a trainload of ties made ready for
                            morning it was ‘Send Haydon’, no extra compensation, but still it gave
                            some privileges.</p>
                        <p>The grading and track laying was progressing rapidly between <placeName>

                            </placeName> and Claypool. The company had a saw-mill at Claypool getting out ties and
                            bridge timbers. The mill was run by John Wells, brother of the superintendent. The first
                            thing he did was to get out the lumber and build himself a house and hotel. This was the
                            first house in Claypool (I think his widow lives in this house at the present time).</p>
                        <p>The country from <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Warsaw</settlement>
                            </placeName> to North <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Manchester</settlement>
                            </placeName> was a virgin forest, hardly a stick of timber being cut out. There was any
                            amount of walnut, three four and five feet through and worth only $10.00 per
                            thousand feet, white oak ties twenty-five cents.</p>
                        <p>The track laying was kept up as close to the grading as possible; all of our locomotives were
                            wood burners, and the summer and fall being very dry the woods caught fire, burning for
                            miles and for days. The whole force had to fight fire. Nothing of importance happened
                            between Claypool and North <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Manchester</settlement>
                            </placeName> with the exception of a small sink hole about two and one-half miles north of
                            North <placeName>

                            </placeName>. This caused some trouble. I will never forget this place because after running
                            over it for days, all at once it would sink almost out of sight. On the first regular train
                            that was run over it there was an old man got on at <geogName>Silver Lake</geogName> going
                            to North <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Manchester</settlement>
                            </placeName> who had never ridden on a train before. In fact, he had never seen a train.
                            Everything went well until we crossed the sink hole, when the track went down and the coach
                            tipped over. It did not hurt anyone, as the train was running slowly, but it scared the poor
                            old man almost to death, and all <pb n="263" id="VAA4025-021-2-161"/> of our persuasion
                            could not get the old chap on the cars again, so he walked back to <geogName>Silver
                            Lake</geogName>. When we first reached North <placeName>

                            </placeName> you could not see the town. It was all forest and the <placeName>

                            very heavy with a grade of from seventy-five feet to eighty-five feet per mile. The company

                            was all rock, and then to make a bad matter worse, here came the failure of Jay Cook
                            &amp; Company, and it was impossible to borrow money, so there was not much headway in
                            construction work for the next year. About all the money the company had for construction
                            was the earnings of the road. This was considerable, as the passenger fare was four cents
                            per mile, no competition on freight, and no State Railway commission, but with all of the
                            drawbacks we built through to <placeName>

                        <p>In 1876 Mr. Gardner died at the Doxey House in Anderson. This was a sad blow, for he was the
                            financier. We kept plodding along. Pay days were few and far between. It was next to
                            impossible to get any money. I was running an engine at this time. The offices were at <placeName>

                            </placeName>, Owen Rice was paymaster. When we would ask him for a little money his answer
                            would be ‘not today.’ Sometimes you would get an order for some
                            groceries. Finally the road was built into Anderson. The company was five months behind with
                            the pay of all trainmen, in fact all of the men but those in construction work. When we
                            reached North Anderson we ran into Anderson over the Pan Handle until the bridge was
                            completed over <geogName>White river</geogName>. This was in 1877. In 1878 the road was sold

                            He was a thorough railroad man from the L. S. &amp; M. S. railroad. The first thing he
                            did was to pay all of the employes two months pay and every month after that we got two
                            months pay until we had received all of our back pay. I was runing local freight at this
                            time for $2.53 per day. The division was from Anderson to <placeName>

                            </placeName>, one hundred and ten miles. It took six days and six night ending at noon
                            Sunday to do a week's work. You would put on your clothes at 4:00 o'clock
                            Monday morning and never take them off until noon the following Sunday. This was not the
                            exception, it was the general rule. I used to live next to the old jail at <placeName>

                    $500,000." It was financed almost entirely by local capital, and no subscription
                    of over $3,500 appears on the articles of incorporation. There were thirteen directors,

                    railroad from Rushville north was not new, as we find a local law passed January 21, 1850,
                    incorporating the Rushville and Muncietown railroad with $200,000 capital stock and seven

                            </placeName>, so I can only give you some recollections of the events. Mr. Norman Beckley
                            was manager of a road already built south from <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Elkhart</settlement>
                            </placeName> to Anderson. A road already built from Rushville to <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">North Vernon</settlement>
                            </placeName> connected with lines both to <placeName>

                            </placeName>. This left a gap of about thirty-seven miles to connect the great lakes and the
                                <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>. Mr. Beckley's idea was to connect the two
                            systems for mutual benefit. The people about <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Knightstown</settlement>
                            </placeName> readily took up with the project. It had long been their desire to secure an
                            outlet to the north and south, and indirectly a competitor to the Pennsylvania's
                            east and west lines running through the city. The pressure of public opinion helped in
                            securing reasonable settlements for right-of-way from land owners along the route. I
                            remember that when it was desired to come to agreement with one stubborn farmer north of
                            town a large number of representative townsmen and farmers visited the farm with the
                            railroad's solicitors and by their presence and sympathy procured an amicable
                            adjustment. <placeName>

                            the project. The road was built in due time and has been very favorably appreciated by the
                            public. Of course, your inquiry about Shirley leads me to say that the town did not come

                            the new road was a great help to shippers in the way of rates; but of course under
                            government control the only advantages derived by the public is convenience of access to

            <p>Great improvements have been made by the Big Four in equipment and right-of-way since it was formed
                    by the consolidation of the various other roads in 1889. Most of the lines have been double-tracked,
                    and that since the consolidaion, <pb n="271" id="VAA4025-021-2-169"/> and much heavier rail
                    installed—in 1889, most of the rail used was 60-lb. rail, and this has been replaced by
                    rail for the most part 105-lb.</p>
            <p>The greatest improvement has taken place on the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> division between <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where several large curves have been straightened. The most noteworthy engineering
                    feat of this kind has been the elimination of the so-called Tanner's Creek menace near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>. On the original right-of-way, the road descended a steep hill in the vicinity of
                    Guilford, and crossed Tanner's creek several times before entering <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> Junction, as the creek was very winding at that place. Not only was the pull up the
                    hill from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> Junction to Guilford very difficult, but Tanner's creek, which is subject to
                    heavy and sudden floods, caused constant damage to the road-bed and track. The Big Four, at its own
                    expense, straightened the course of Tanner's creek, constructed a fill out of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> Junction which ran parallel to the straightened course of the creek, and made a cut in
                    the hill which made a gradual slope from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> Junction up the Guilford hill. This made the pull up the hill much easier, and also
                    eliminated the numerous bridges of the road over the creek. Now, because of the fill, the road runs
                    along the creek at an elevation, so that its sudden rises cause no damage and no hindrance to the
                    movement of trains.<hi rend="sup">153</hi> The cost of all these improvements on the <placeName>

            <p>A graphic way to show the progress in equipment and construction is to compare some old
                    advertisements of 1889 with the same kind of material used today. The advertisements quoted from
                    below are taken from <hi rend="i">Poor's Manual of Railroads</hi> for 1889 and 1890.</p>

            <p>The following description is given of the Fisher Standard Single U-Bolt Joint: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The rail ends are supported by the long-flanged beam, secured on two ties by spikes passing
                            through it. They are held down to it by the nuts and the two ends of the U-bolt passing up
                            vertically through it, and the corners of the rail bases.</p>
                    </quote>
                </p>
            <p>The Angle Bar, the modern form of rail-joint, as previously described, is bolted to the side of the
                    rails, and also spiked down against the flanges of the rail and the ties, making a very secure
                    joint. Some modern ones have patented joints, that is, grooves into which the flange of the rail
                    fits before the Angle Bar is spiked to the tie.</p>
            <p>Several foundries advertise steel blooms, old-fashioned pieces of steel used in the old-time bloom
                    rolling-mill. Now steel billets are used for this purpose; and with the introduction of better
                    machinery, and the substitution of automatic processes for hand processes on some of the rolling
                    mill operations, the billets can be of any shape, whereas the old blooms had to be round.</p>
            <p>Hendricks Brothers advertise among other things, locomotive firebox copper. Although sheet-steel was
                    not at first successful when used in fire-boxes, it has been adjusted so that it has entirely
                    supplanted copper for this purpose in America. Mention of gasoline headlights reminds one also that
                    they have been almost entirely superseded by electric head-lights with current furnished by a steam
                    turbo-generator on the engine.</p>
            <p>Richard Dudgeon advertises packs for pressing on crank-pins on locomotive wheels. Now they are fitted
                    on by specially-built mechanical presses. An advertisement by the Eames Vacuum Brake Co. brings back
                    the fact that at one time a vacuum instead of increased air pressure was introduced to break the
                    balance of pressure in the air tanks and thus operate the brakes. Many firms advertise wrought-iron
                    turnbuckles, which are used to regulate the amount of stress on the truss-rods underneath a freight
                    car, and a great many cars are still equipped with them, although they and truss-rods are gradually
                    being replaced by all steel underframes.</p>
            <pb n="273" id="VAA4025-021-2-171"/>
            <p>The Locomotive Lubricating Co. call attention to their lubricator, "the only lubricator used
                    on crank pins having a positive feed, as it is kept directly in contact with the pin and is worn
                    away as the pin requires lubrication." The lubricators on the locomotives of today are in
                    the cab, and contain pipes to various places on the engine to be lubricated, through which the oil
                    is driven to them by means of steam pressure, though a few places are still lubricated by hand. Thus
                    the engineer can regulate most of his lubrication from the cab.</p>
            <p>Paul S. Reeves, in the advertisement of his tubal smelting works, says, "lead-lined and
                    phosphor-bronze car bearings a specialty." Today, car bearings are of brass, and are lined
                    with babbitt, a special alloy of copper, tin and antimony, which makes a very smooth surface.</p>
            <p>One interesting advertisement is for the anti-friction bearings of the Car Truck Supply Company.
                    "The car body rests on seven hard steel rollers at each end of each bolster; these rollers
                    revolve once or more at each curve and therefore could not wear flat." Now, there is a
                    special bolster called the body bolster secured to the car body; this fits into a round place in the
                    heavier truck bolster, and is fastened to it by means of a king-pin. This not only forms a
                    substantial bearing for the car body, but enables it to turn more gradually than the truck on a
                    sharp curve.</p>
            <p>No doubt it would be interesting to speculate on the improvements of thirty years from now in
                    railroad material; but no doubt thirty years from now will find the Big Four in this department
                    still abreast of the times.</p>
