                    Titus was accompanied by his fiancée, Martha Dunn, and the couple was appropriately
                    chaperoned by Professor William C. Larrabee and his wife Harriet, the elder sister of Martha.
                    Attractive prospects awaited them at the end of their difficult journey. Larrabee, an 1828 graduate
                    of Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, and a distinguished professor at Maine Wesleyan Seminary at
                    Kent's Hill in Readfield, was traveling to Indiana to become professor of mathematics and

                    <pb n="194" id="VAA4025-085-3-008"/> Titus, after desultory study in several seminaries in Maine,
                    was going to I.A.U. to complete his degree under the aegis of Larrabee— and under the
                    watchful eye of Martha.</p>
            <p>The three-week journey to Indiana included every kind of public transportation then available. The
                    group traveled by steamboat from Portland, Maine, to Boston; from Boston "in the
                    cars" (by railroad) to Worcester and New London; thence by steamboat on Long Island Sound
                    to New York, where (as Titus unhelpfully recorded) they "saw little except for the streets
                    and buildings."<hi rend="sup">2</hi> From New York they went by boat to Amboy, New Jersey,
                    then to Philadelphia, where they paused to rest and take in "Peale's Museum
                    &amp; Dunn's ditto." From Philadelphia they traveled to Harrisburg by
                    railroad. Here they interrupted their journey with a side trip of three days to visit Dickinson
                    College at Carlisle. Returning to Harrisburg by rail, they began their passage through the Allegheny
                    Mountains to Pittsburgh. Surprisingly, it was possible for them to go almost the entire distance by
                    the Pennsylvania canal system. At Hollidaysburg they were carried by the Allegheny Portage Railroad
                    thirty-six miles over the mountains in a frightening snowstorm to Johnstown where they resumed
                    travel on the canal to Pittsburgh.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> It was April 13 when they "started
                    in the splendid steam boat Lebanon" down the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> to Cincinnati where the <hi rend="i">Lebanon</hi> paused a day and they were able to go
                    ashore. The river journey then continued to Louisville, a "very flourishing
                    place," where they took the steamboat <hi rend="i">Orleans</hi> for the remainder of the
                    voyage down the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> to its confluence with the Wabash; steamed up the Wabash to Terre Haute; then, as Titus
                    concludes his itinerary, traveled "by stage 35 miles to Greencastle Ia. [Indiana] where we
                    arrived Apr. 23d 1841."</p>
            <p>Within a week after arriving in Greencastle, Titus was appointed tutor of languages in the
                    Preparatory School of Indiana Asbury and at the same time was admitted to the senior class of the
                    university. On September 14, 1842, he received his diploma <list type="footnotes">

                            the university in 184–1849 and in 1852 was elected Indiana's first state
                            superintendent of public instruction. Harriet Larrabee founded the Greencastle Female
                            Collegiate Seminary and was a leader in higher education for women. See George B. Manhart,

                    made their way by stage to Madison, Indiana, where Titus was to become superintendent of the newly
                    founded Madison Male and Female Seminary. This position was apparently offered him through his
                    friendship with the Reverend Edward R. Ames, also from Maine, who had close ties to Indiana Asbury
                    and who had come to Madison in 1838 as preacher and director of affairs in the Madison Charge. (He
                    was later to become a prominent Methodist bishop.)<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though the Indiana Constitution of 1816 had mandated free public schools for all children, the
                    General Assembly did not appropriate sufficient funds to establish such a system, and education of
                    the time was commonly offered by privately operated or denominational schools and
                    "seminaries." Madison supported several competing seminaries at the time that
                    Titus and his bride arrived to begin their new employment. Among them were the Upper Seminary, built
                    in 1838; the school of Mr. and Mrs. E. Levy; and Madison Young Ladies' Seminary, operated
                    by William Twining, all of which were well established before the Tituses came on the scene.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> Further, the Tituses arrived in Madison at a time of considerable dissension
                    among the Methodist community (largely, it seems, the result of debate over the role of music in the
                    worship service). In 1841 the Third Street Charge, of which Ames was secretary, had separated from
                    the Wesley Chapel because of "dislike to the <hi rend="i">Choir</hi> which exists in the
                    old congregation."<hi rend="sup">7</hi> One infers that members of the new congregation
                    wished to sponsor a school answering to their convictions and that Ames brought Titus to Madison to
                    direct it.</p>
            <p>The circumstances were hardly propitious for two downeasters to bring their learning (and their
                    accents) to southern Indiana. Nonetheless, the Tituses approached the task with a confident
                    professional air, as can be seen in the broadside that they issued to herald their coming. They
                    promised a "thorough and extensive" <list type="footnotes">

                    rather soon in that fall of 1841, for by the following May, Titus was more than ready to abandon the
                    role of Hoosier schoolmaster. In a letter to his wife (who, significantly, had rejoined her sister
                    in Greencastle) Titus complains about his "lonely and desolate" situation. He
                    takes some comfort in the thought that "there are more noise, confusion and
                    misrule" in Twining's school "than there ever has been in ours, even in
                    its very worst state. So it seems that other teachers are not more blessed than we." There
                    has been, apparently, a possibility that he might take over the competing school, but he scornfully
                    rejects the thought of being "run over" by Twining's "set of
                    idle, uncultivated, barbarous girls." Adding to his disgust, support has not come from his
                    own church. Ruefully he tells Martha, "The Episcopalians, Catholics &amp; Universalists
                    have been more faithful to us, than those of our own family."<hi rend="sup">9</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, on June 5, 1843, Titus closed his school, collected all fees due him, and went to the Madison
                    railroad "dep6t on the river" to begin his journey back to Greencastle. There he
                    would be reunited not only with his wife but also with Brother Ames, who had apparently left his
                    Madison responsibilities and had been spending the year "in the Indian Country, South of
                    the Missouri." It is, however, in happy expectation of reunion with Martha—the
                    unpleasant aspects of his Madison experience already behind him—that Titus writes
                    lyrically about his life in "the pleasant city of Madison." On this note begins
                    the first of three "chapters"—seventy manuscript pages—that
                    describe his journey to rejoin his wife and, surprisingly soon thereafter, his departure with Ames
                    for Lafayette and a journey via the Wabash and Erie Canal to Toledo, <placeName>

                    </placeName>, the first stage of an ambitious plan to explore Detroit and the Indian lands of the
                    "North West." Titus and Ames set out from Greencastle in the middle of June, 1843.
                    They returned on August 25, after extensively exploring Lakes Huron and Superior and covering
                    hundreds of miles in a birchbark canoe with Indian guides.</p>

                    chapters that most tellingly portray life in Indiana a century and a half ago, particularly life
                    along the Wabash and Erie Canal as it was developing into a major waterway through the state. The
                    manuscript also reveals much about Titus himself. One sees a devout, unpedantic young scholar, and a
                    venturesome one as well, who dared leave his beloved Maine to seek a new life on the frontier. He
                    has an appraising eye for the farms and forests and economy of Indiana as well as respect for its
                    people and their history. Perhaps if certain Madison schoolgirls had not been so
                    "uncultivated and barbarous," he would have remained in Indiana, as did many
                    another visitor from the east, to become a good Hoosier like his mentor William Larrabee; but the
                    disparity between remembered Maine and experienced Indiana proved too great. On September 19, 1843,
                    the Tituses departed Greencastle for home and the life of the itinerant Methodist minister. Once
                    back east Titus also devoted himself to advancement in Freemasonry, an interest that he had had
                    since his student days. A Masonic Lodge created at Taunton, Massachusetts, in 1873 bears his name;
                    apparently the only publication until now to do so is the 1874 volume of the <hi rend="i">New

            <p>I had been in the "Great West", now, a little more than two years. My former
                    errors, in regard to this magnificent country, had become corrected, &amp; many of my former
                    prejudices set aside. I could now enjoy worship in the sanctuary of God, if every thing was not
                    conducted precisely <hi rend="u">a la New England</hi>. I could live on "hog &amp;
                    homony", "flour bread &amp; chicken fixins", or even relish
                    "corn bread and common doings". I had some reason to hope too, that, in my case, I
                    had succeeded, in some good degree, to allay the prejudices against "Yankees". So
                    life in the West was now becoming pleasant and agreeable to me. I had also been fortunate, in the
                    acquaintances I had formed, in gaining the true and lasting friendship of many of earth's
                    most noble sons. Those, whose sensibilities were easily aroused, and whose generous hearts were ever
                    open to sympathy. The "stranger" had been most kindly received, and confidence and
                    trust placed in him. By the aid of a kind Providence, I had preserved that trust inviolate, and
                    places of still greater emolument and trust were open before me.</p>
            <p>A year and a half of that time had been spent in assiduous study at a new and thriving Institution,
                    where I had also labored to direct and cultivate the mind of the young aspirant for science. The
                    last nine months had been spent, most agreably in the pleasant city of Madison, one of the finest

                            purchased by the Huntington Library, San Marino, California, on November 23, 1937, from the
                            American Autograph Shop, Merion, Pennsylvania. John H. Rhodehamel, assistant curator of
                            American history, Huntington Library, to George P. Clark, November 15, 1988. According to
                            the catalog from which the purchase was made, the journal, together with other manuscripts,
                            had been kept "in the trunk of a descendent." The editor has made every
                            effort to transcribe the Charles H. Titus journal exactly as it was written. Misspellings
                            and other errors in grammar have been retained and have not been indicated by a [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>]. Arbitrary decisions were at times necessary, however, in
                            differentiating between capital and lower case letters. Titus was also frequently unclear in
                            his use of commas, periods, semicolons, and colons. In such instances the editor has
                            selected whichever mark best contributed to the meaning of the sentence. Vagaries in
                            Titus's handwriting sometimes made it difficult to determine whether or not a word
                            was misspelled. (It was sometimes impossible, for example, to distinguish between an
                            "i" or an "e" and between an "m" or an
                            "n" or a "u.") Because Titus was obviously articulate
                            and well educated, the editor in cases of doubt has assumed that the journalist's
                            penmanship, not his knowledge, was at fault and has transcribed the words as if correctly
                            written. No attempt has been made to identify any of the Methodist "preachers on
                            the circuit" whom Titus mentions other than to provide their first names in
                            brackets in the text whenever possible.</item>

                    blessed and happy in the ardent affection of a young and lovely wife. I was associated with
                    cultivated, genteel, and religious society, that would have made the life of any but the
                    misanthrope, pleasant and happy. I was now about to return to the land of my
                    "fathers", and it was with feelings of sincere regret, that I bid my friends in
                    Madison farewell. My wife had gone on to Greencastle before me, on a visit to her sister. This was
                    our first separation, since marriage, and it had now been four weeks since she departed. No wonder,
                    then, that I labored anxiously &amp; hard to close up my business, &amp; that it was with
                    feelings of the utmost pleasure that, on the morning of the fifth of June, I found myself on board a
                    rail road car, ratling along toward G. with most joyful anticipations of the future meeting. I had
                    succeeded in collecting every debt due me for Tuition; &amp; it is but justice to the good
                    people of Madison to say, that they used me most gentlemanly.</p>
            <p>Madison is delightfully situated on a narrow strip of bottom land, which terminates in high,
                    precipitous bluffs. On one side rolls the majestic <placeName>

                    man's inventive genius. On the other, rise these mountain bluffs, densely covered with the
                    beautiful hickory, oak &amp; maple. Across the river sight is obstructed by the beautiful hills
                    of Kentucky. The buildings are nearly all new, &amp; built, principally, of brick. Many of the
                    edifices are finely constructed, &amp; present both a neat and comfortable appearance. The

                            other states initiated their own internal improvements projects. In 1836 the Indiana General
                            Assembly passed a mammoth internal improvements bill that provided for a statewide system of
                            canals, railroads, and roads to be financed primarily by the sale of state bonds. Included
                            was a railroad to be constructed between Madison and Lafayette via Columbus, Indianapolis,
                            and Crawfordsville. Because of poor planning, mismanagement, fraud, nationwide depression,
                            and myriad other problems the System of 1836 had all but collapsed by 1839. No major project
                            was near completion, and the state could not pay even the interest on its debt. In an
                            attempt to get at least a few of the works completed the legislature authorized private
                            companies to take over a number of the projects. The Madison and Indianapolis Railroad was
                            first leased to a group of individuals, then, after brief resumption of control by the

                    attempted to ascend by steam power, but it was found impossible, and they found themselves in the
                    most imminent danger of running into the river. Horses are now used to haul the cars up, and they
                    are regulated in the descent, by means of breaks. Up this ascent, I was dragged, with slow &amp;

                    single track, but this is well and permanently laid. The road is smooth enough to run thirty or
                    forty miles an hour with safety, but the rate of speed is not generally more than about fifteen. The

                            a succession of specially designed wood-burning steam locomotives, among them the

                    long, however, before we made our way to the "Hotel"—so
                    called—where I did ample justice to a dinner of "flour bread and chicken
                    fixins". About one o'clock we got started in the stage, and were dragged along
                    till five, over a muddy road, full of holes, logs, stumps and other things too numerous to mention,
                    when we arrived at Columbus, fourteen miles from Scipio. We considered ourselves very fortunate,
                    that we did not get turned over, &amp; that, we were "stalled" but once. This
                    was in ascending a steep little hill that was very muddy. The wheels sank into the mud so far that
                    it was impossible for the horses to haul us up; so we were forced to get out into the deep mud, to
                    lighten the coach. Our muddy plight, when we again entered the coach at the top of the hill, caused
                    us much amusement, and the servents at the tavern where we stopped, much labor. At Columbus we found
                    a tolerable good tavern, kept by one Jones, who was quite a gentlemanly landlord. Among the
                    travellers who stopped here for the night, I found Bishop —– of the
                    Episcopalian Church, on his way to Baltimore.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> He was much of a gentleman in his
                    manners, &amp; I judged him a talented man. Ex-Governor Wallace, of whom I had often heard, and
                    to whom I had felt favorably inclined, on account of a speech he once delivered, in which he spoke
                    very favorably of the Methodist Church and eulogized her ministers, was also among the company. I
                    had the pleasure of an introduction to him, and found him a very pleasant man in private
                        conversation.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I retired to rest about ten o'clock, with fears that I should not be able to proceed the
                    next day, as the stage from Indianapolis had not arrived. This stage returns to Indianapolis from
                    this place, with the passengers brought up from the depot, and unless this arrived there was no
                    stage in which we could go on; this not being a daily line. I had hopes that it might arrive during
                    the night, but I found in the morning that no stage had come, being detained by high water in the
                    rivers, that they were accustomed to ford. It was exceedingly unpleasant to be thus detained, when I
                    was so anxious to get on; but there was no means of proceeding, so I was forced to submit. During
                    the day I strolled about the town, but found nothing of interest. In the afternoon I concluded to
                    call upon the Preacher in charge of the circuit, and scrape up an acquaintance with him, that, if
                    possible I might make the time pass less heavily. <list type="footnotes">

                    have with me, that Br. [James] Templin was sent to this charge; so I enquired where he lived, and
                    made my way to his house. I introduced myself, and soon found that we had met before, at the Con. at
                    Terre Haute.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> I was kindly invited to supper, and as it was an hour or so till
                    supper time, we spent this time, in strolling through the woods, partly for a walk, but principally
                    for the purpose of seeing the singular junction of the <geogName>Blue river</geogName>, and
                        <geogName>White Water river</geogName>, which, when united form the <geogName>Flat Rock
                    river</geogName>. The two streams, before uniting, flow in exactly opposite directions. At the time
                    I was there, the water in both rivers was very high, and the currents exceedingly rapid; so that
                    they came together with great violence, and caused a tremendous whirlling and foaming of the water;
                    presenting an appearance of much interests.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> Br. Templin took the pains to send
                    about the town and let the people know that I was in the place, and would preach in the evening. So
                    by dark, quite a large congregation had assembled. During the short sermon I tried to preach for
                    them, they were very attentive, and seemed to be much interested.</p>
            <p>Wednesday morning we prevailed upon a hack driver, who came up from the depot the day before, to try
                    to take us through to Franklin, from which place there was no obstruction till we should arrive at
                    Indianapolis. We thought that we could get across the streams by some means, and, though our
                    progress might be slow, it would be better than remaining at Columbus. We got started a little after
                    day light, and arrived at Edingburgh [Edinburgh]—ten miles—about seven
                    o'clock. Here we were told that we could not possibly proceed. The water in the river was
                    very high, so that all the bottom land on both sides of it was overflown. It was a mile or more
                    across the water at this place. There was a ferry boat, but it was fastened to a tree about midway
                    from either bank, and there was no means of getting to it. The ferryman declared that it was
                    impossible to set us across, even if the ferry boat could be obtained, on account of the rapidity of
                    the current. We were now worse off, than if we had staid at Columbus, for there was, here, but one

                    woman, who had a large family of dirty children. I managed, however, to make a tolerable breakfast
                    on boiled eggs and coffee. After breakfast we put our wits to work to devise some means of getting
                    on. We learned, after patient inquiry, that by going back four miles, we could find a good ferry,
                    and then by going round by a little town called Williamsburgh [present-day Nineveh], we could get to
                    Franklin; though it would be a hard days ride. This we concluded to do, rather than remain, we knew
                    not how long in that miserable hole. After much solicitation we prevailed upon the driver to
                    undertake it. The road back to the ferry was quite good, &amp; we had no difficulty in reaching
                    it. But the boat was on the other side, &amp; the ferryman gone, so here we came to a stand
                    still again. We sent a boy for a trumpet, and after "tooting" away for a long
                    time, we succeeded in arousing the men on the other side, who had gone over in the ferry boat; when
                    they came and set us safely across. The road as far as Williamsburgh, was not worse than we had
                    before, but from this place to Franklin, it was horribly bad beyond all description. Most of the way
                    all the gentleman pasengers were obliged to walk; the baggage and two ladies making sufficient load
                    for the two tired horses. A great part of this road was through the woods, where there was only a
                    cow path, and it was sometimes exceedingly difficult to find space between the trees sufficient for
                    the coach to pass through. Still we wouned our way along, and, as we had first rate horses and
                    drivers, succeeded in reaching Franklin about sun set; when we were completely tired out.</p>
            <p>At Williamsburgh, we had a fair sample of a back woods village. A cluster of ill arranged houses,
                    built principally of logs, and in every conceivable form and shape. One store with a few old rusty
                    goods and a "beggarly account of empty boxes"; a black smith's shop,
                    which consisted of a few logs thrown up, a small stone chimney, a small bellows, and a small man to
                    blow them; one tavern, built also of logs, presenting a most filthy and unforbiding aspect.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> At the time we passed through the place, there was also a court of justice,
                    where some poor culprit was being tried, before his excellency, the justice, for some misdemeanor.
                    Dickens should have seen the company assembled to witness the trial, for his pen alone could give an
                    adequate description of such an assemblage. Their countenances bespoke ignorance, superstition and
                    their general accompaniment "brass". Among them was found the blustering
                    politician, the know-every-thing physician, the profound metaphysician and the astute theologian.
                    Their dress was of all colors and fashions. Take them, all in all, they presented rather a ludicrous
                    appearance.</p>

            <p>At Franklin we had tolerably good accommodations, and found a stage there to convey us on next day to
                    Indianapolis; where we arrived about one o'clock. The road we travelled this day was the
                    regular built corduroy; and the way we were knocked and thumped about was a caution. Those that have
                    never ridden over such a road can have no idea of the tremendous jolting that the poor body suffers.
                    Such roads are generally built where the land is low and swampy. Sometimes the logs are split and
                    laid close together, the split side up. Then it is not bad to travel over. But generally they are
                    round logs, laid crosswise, from six inches to a foot and half through.</p>
            <p>There were five passengers, beside myself—three gentlemen, and two ladies. One of the
                    former was from Canton, O. a large muscular man, whose visage denoted that he was not always
                    accustomed to make cold water his only drink, and his breath generally confirmed the fact. Yet he
                    was a jovial, good hearted, companion, ever ready to stand in the front of every difficulty; and
                    amid all the toil and fatigue of the journey, which were excessive, was ever cheerful, and extremely
                    gallent to the ladies. The two other gentlemen passengers were both from Pennsylvania, and both
                    students. One, however, had been some time from academic study, travelling through the Western
                    States &amp; Territories, so that the study of college life had been, in some degree, rubbed
                    off; and we found him quite a pleasant fellow traveller. The other was just from college halls;
                    travelling for the purpose of recruiting his health, &amp; visiting some friends in Indiana. He
                    was, evidently, but little acquainted with the world. He seemed excessively fond of spouting Latin
                    verses from Virgil, and like other Sophomores, that I have seen, to think that, though the name of
                    his class denoted the "wise fool", he was an illustrious example of one, who could
                    claim much more of the former than of the latter. However, by a few well directed jokes we succeeded
                    in keeping him near his proper level. One of the ladies was young, and somewhat handsome, and
                    evidently prided herself upon her great beauty. She wore immense curls, of which she seemed very
                    vain. She said but little, and perhaps had a better mind than her appearance indicated. The other
                    lady—a Mrs. H. of I. was the most resigned in difficulties and courages in peril, of all
                    women that I have ever travelled with. She had with her a young child, which required her constant
                    care to keep from being thumped to a jelly against the sides of the coach. This, beside the almost
                    constant danger of upsetting in passing over perilous places, and through deep and dangerous mud
                    holes, caused her excessive fatigue; and yet, I never heard from her one murmur, or one exclamation
                    of fear.</p>
            <p>At Indianapolis, I stopped with Br. Wilkins—had a hearty welcome, and found an excellent
                    home. Here I rested, and by four o'clock next morning, when the stage called for me was
                    pretty well <pb n="210" id="VAA4025-085-3-024"/> recruited. The distance from Madison to
                    Indianapolis is eighty five miles. This is the least interesting part of the State of Indiana. The
                    land is generally low and swampy, difficult for cultivation and exceedingly unhealthy. Perhaps it is
                    more subject to Fever &amp; Ague than any other part of the state. It is now a tedious ride, but
                    when the Rail Road is finished, it will be a very pleasant trip. Indianapolis is a beautiful
                    village, though, like many other beautiful villages of the West, is very unhealthy, especially for

                    at this time was only a box on wheels. At half past one, arrived at Br. Larrabee's, and
                    found myself once more blessed, in the society of my dear wife, &amp; Br. L's dear

                    spent a week most pleasantly. During this time, Br. E. R. Ames, Cor. Sec. of the Miss. So. for the

                    of the country; so I concluded to delay my return home to Maine for a few months and accompany him;
                    my wife remaining, during the time, with her sister, Mrs. Larrabee. We made our preparations for the
                    journey, and started June 19—for Crawfordsville—twenty eight
                    miles—there to take the stage for Lafayette, from which place we could proceed in the

                            </placeName>, through Fort Wayne to the mouth of the Tippecanoe River near Lafayette. The
                            canal was to be financed in part by federal land grants and by state bonds. In 1836 the
                            Wabash and Erie was incorporated into the internal improvements System of 1836. The
                            legislature at that time determined that the canal should be extended to Terre Haute where,
                            via the Cross Cut Canal, it should join the Central Canal on its way to Evansville.
                            Approximately ninety miles of the Wabash and Erie had been completed by 1839 when the system
                            floundered; the canal had reached Lafayette in 1843 shortly before Titus and Ames began
                            their journey to Toledo. In 1847 the state of Indiana deeded the Wabash and Erie to
                            bondholders, who were to complete the canal to Evansville and accept it as full payment on
                            half of the state's internal improvements debt. The canal finally reached
                            Evansville in 1853. By this date, how ever, the canal era was already past its zenith, and
                            by the mid-1870s the Wabash and Erie was virtually defunct. Barnhart and Carmony, <hi rend="i">Indiana,</hi> I, 322-25, 333-36, 341-43; Fatout, <hi rend="i">Indiana

                    whether it is two high stories, or four low stories in height. The whole building appears as though
                    an attempt had been made to excel every other speciman of architecture in the whole country, and
                    they had made a complete failure. The halls are narrow—the rooms small, &amp; the

                            continued cooperation with the New England Congregationalists and saw slavery as no ban to
                            Christian communion. "New School" advocates wanted to continue their close
                            association with missionaries of the Congregationalist church and condemned slavery without

            <p>On our way to Lafayette, we had a state road for a few miles— badly cut up &amp; very
                    rough. A short distance out of Crawfordsville, passed an extensive flouring establishment, belonging
                    to Major Elston, of C., where he is making an immense amount of money.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> Not far
                    from this mill we passed a building that was formerly used as a distilery. I believe this was the
                    first time I ever looked with unalloyed pleasure upon an old, dilapidated, deserted, ruinous house:
                    It looked as though the poisons that it had, for so long a time, been sending forth to the world,
                    had seized upon its own frame, at last, &amp; brought quick destruction. A greater part of this
                    road was quite good, &amp; we rolled pleasantly along. Part of the country was very fine. There
                    was some splendid timber land—rich strong soil—and gigantic trees. Passed
                    through Nine Mile prairie— the soil exceedingly rich, but the land rather too low for
                    successful cultivation. There were some few "<hi rend="u">swells</hi>" that would
                    make most splendid farms. Some of which were under fine cultivation. After passing from the Nine

                    eight miles below Lafayette the driver stopped to water the horses, as is the custom in this

                    there was an abundance, to which we were heartily welcome, if we would step in. We were not backward
                    in availing ourselves of her hospitality, and made a hearty dinner of corn bread, pie &amp;
                    milk: after which we felt our "corporosity" wonderfully improved. The remainder of
                    our ride to Lafayette was through a rich and finely cultivated country. We saw some excellent fields
                    of wheat, and some extensive fields of barley, which I suppose were intended for the Brewery. Alas,

                    old and poor, but the square on which it is situated, a fine one. They have lately built a County

                    packets in, &amp; no one knew when one would arrive.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> This end of the canal
                    had been greatly injured by a late flood, &amp; the boats were just now starting out for the
                    first time since the injury was repaired. The boat, on which we took passage, was quite new,
                    &amp; had a neat cabin, though it was very smal. There was also a cabin aft, where the cooking
                    and eating was done. The freight was stowed between the forward and after cabins, consisting of
                    corn, wheat, oats &amp; bacon. There was a little cubby hole, amid ships, which was used as a
                    stable for the horses; two being fed and rested here, while the other two are towing the boat. I
                    said rested, but I should think there could not be much rest, for the place is very small and the
                    horses never lie down.</p>
            <p>There were but few passengers. One was a young Irish lady, quite neat &amp;
                    tidy—evidently unaccustomed to travelling. There was a gentleman travelling with her, who
                    I supposed to be her father, whose greatest trouble, when he was siting in the cabin, seemed to be,
                    to find a place for his hands, and some object to look at. There were two or three other passengers,
                    rather Jonathan looking,<hi rend="sup">17</hi> &amp; who said but little. Br. A soon stowed
                    himself away on the comfortable cushioned seat, very much at his ease, and engaged in perusing an
                    old novel that he found among the "truck" in the closet. I spent the time in
                    pencilling down such thoughts as happened to come to my mind—when this did not require
                    too much effort— lolling about on the bench, in the most comfortable attitudes that I
                    could find, pleased with myself &amp; all around me, and fully resolved to get as much comfort
                    as possible. Such canal boat riding, though dul and monotonous, and wearisome on that account, if
                    long continued, is certainly not very disagreeable for a short time; for one can read, or sleep, or
                    lounge about, a la loafer, or engage in writing, or conversation with all the ease and pleasure that
                    such things are done any where.</p>
            <p>The country through which we passed during the first &amp; second day was very excellent, the
                    farms quite old and fine cultivation. I observed, too, that the fruit trees were older and more
                    abundant, than in other parts of the state which I had visited. Most <list type="footnotes">

                     <hi rend="sup">16</hi> Canal boats on the Wabash and Erie ranged from about forty to one
                            hundred feet in length. Freight boats were generally pulled by two or three mules, hitched
                            single file, tandem style, to a tow line approximately 250 feet long. The driver rode the
                            hindmost mule. Three miles per hour was a good speed. Packets were passenger boats, and as a
                            rule they provided better accommodations than freighters as well as averaging from five to
                            seven miles per hour. Drivers and teams, which commonly consisted of three horses, were
                            changed at each station along the route in order to maintain the scheduled time. Benjamin F.

                    enterprise and industry. Such farmers on such land can never want. About eleven miles from Lafayette
                    we passed a small town called Americus. All the greatness was in the name. Appearances were
                    decidedly in favor of the opinion that the Fever &amp; Ague were abundant. A few sleepy looking
                    men were lolling around a store, who looked as though the "chills" had driven all
                    warmth from their hearts, and the fever had burned out all desire and love of industry or enterprise
                    from their souls.<hi rend="sup">18</hi> A few miles further up, passed a grist mill, that was rather
                    a caution. The water was brought in a flue about two feet wide to a wheel of about 20 feet in
                    diameter. There was but little water, and the wheel being much heavier on one side than on the
                    other, would almost stop, when the heavier part was rising and go with a whew when that part was
                    descending. There was one small run of stones, and some corn in grinding. There was no man about the
                    mill or any where in sight. From appearances, I judged that a bushel of corn might thus be ground in
                    about 24 hours. Such was a Hoosier mill.</p>
            <p>Eighteen miles from our starting place, we came to a pleasant little village called Delphi.<hi rend="sup">19</hi> Here we tarried awhile, &amp; I took a strol through the town and found
                    an old acquaintance, one of the former students of the I.A.U. I was much pleased to meet with him,
                    and told him all I knew of his old classmates, some of whom I had lately seen.</p>
            <p>The land about the town is low and flat, with many puddles of stagnant water. It is decidedly a
                    sickly place. Fever &amp; Ague are especially abundant. But the inhabitants have become so
                    accustomed to this disease that they do not seem to care much about it. We found here a number of
                    boats loading with wheat, which at this time was very much in demand.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> Steam

                    crossing the river, Br. A. &amp; myself concluded we would try to get a little sleep, it being
                    then nearly ten o'clock. We descended to the cabin and found that the other passengers had
                    already crawled into their births. One little corner of the little cabin we found curtained off with
                    a little curtain, for the little Irish lady. The odor of the cabin was decidedly unpleasant, but
                    there was no help for it. As there was no better arrangement possible, we concluded to pack
                    ourselves away upon the little shelves, that had been prepared for us, and see if "kind
                    natures sweet restorer" would come to our assistance.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> Br.
                    A's <hi rend="u">Shelf</hi> was immediately above mine, the space between being but little
                    more than one foot. As Br. A. was a pretty heavy man I felt somewhat fearful that his <hi rend="u">tackling</hi> might give way, and I get a little more squeezing than would be comfortable. But,
                    feeling some confidence in his <hi rend="u">cords</hi> I pulled off my coat, vest &amp; shoes,
                    lay myself along, and rolled in. The birth was hard and narrow, and though my limbs ached
                    exceedingly from lying so long in one position, there was no turning over; though I did manage once
                    to get partly onto my back for a few minutes. The clatter of the men upon the deck of the boat, and
                    my unusual and painful position, kept me, for a long time, wakeful &amp; restless. At length,
                    however, I lost all conciousness of my real troubles in sleep; but then, alas! dreams of narrow
                    passages, &amp; of being stifled in some pent up hole, added ten fold to my former uneasiness.
                    Soon my position became still more wretched and I seemed to be in some horrid, filthy den,
                    surrounded by <hi rend="u">frogs</hi> &amp; snakes and all kinds of loathsome reptiles. At
                    length I seemed resolved, at all hazards, to make my way out of that, and commenced crawling from
                    the horrid place. When I became once more conscious, I found myself stumbling over the chairs of the
                    cabin, on my way to the door. But still I found that it was not all a dream, that a little fresh air
                    would, in reality, be very comfortable; so I kept on to the door, &amp; felt much refreshed by
                    the cool night air. I looked around, on reaching the door, when lo, &amp; behold! instead of
                    moving on toward <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Maumee City</settlement>

                    seemed to be impressed with the idea, that the more noise they made, the more easily they would get
                    free. By dint of loud talking, and jabbering, &amp; swearing, &amp; hallooing, &amp;
                    pushing with their long poles, &amp; pulling &amp; running, and whipping up the horses, they
                    did, after two hours, succeed in getting off. I soon returned to my <hi rend="u">shelf</hi>, and

                    efforts in finding out my whereabouts, I became conscious of the fact that I was still
                    alive—that Br A's. shelf still held its relative distance from my own, and that
                    silence was reigning around. I was fearful that we might be still upon the log, or were stopped from
                    some other cause. I crawled out, and poking my head out of the cabin door found that, sure enough,
                    we were making no progress. I learned upon inquiry that we had been in that fix since two
                    o'clock, &amp; were likely to remain so for three or four hours more. This, certainly,
                    was not very pleasant, especially as we were very anxious to get on. The cause of our delay was,
                    that the gates in the lock where we were, had been opened in the night and permitted to remain so;
                    while those in the lock above remained closed. The consequences of this mismanagement were, that the
                    water was drawn off of the level above us, between the two locks, and it was impossible for us to
                    proceed until the water could be let in at the upper lock and fill the level again. A boy had been
                    sent up to open the gates of the lock above, and the water was already rising. In about two hours
                    the boat floated again, but we proceeded very slowly; the boat rubbing against the bottom, every few
                    rods, and sometimes stopping entirely, where we were forced to remain until the rising water floated
                    us off. I found my breakfast this morning, (Thurs. June 22.) rather uneatable; either from the want
                    of an appetite, or because the breakfast was, in reality, poor. Perhaps a little of both. The coffee
                    certainly was not drinkable; and I seemed suddenly to have lost all relish for eggs and
                    bacon—the staff of life in this country. So I nibbled away at a cracker, awhile, and
                    drank a little cold water, concluding I would wait till dinner time, &amp; see if an appetite
                    would not come. Luckly, when called to the dinner table, I felt that I could relish almost any kind
                    of food; &amp; still more luckily I found what I can relish at most any time, viz: good boiled
                    eggs, good chocolate &amp; biscuit. I sat till all the rest were done, and until the cook was
                    evidently beginning to despair of ever getting rid of me. Though I found a tolerable excuse in the
                    fact that the chocolate was so hot, I must necessarily wait for it to cool. But, surely, I did eat a
                    very abundant dinner.</p>
            <p>After moving along very slowly for six or seven hours we arrived at Logansport, a very pleasant town,
                    situated on the Wabash. I had a package of letters to deliver at this place, and in the course of my
                    inquiry, found a man who offered to deliver it to the person to whom it was directed. This gentleman
                    was a tavern keeper, formerly from Maryland—had lived in Canada, Detroit, &amp;
                    several other places, previous to his residence in L. He expressed himself much pleased with the
                    character of the people from my native state, &amp; assured me, that he had found no people, in
                    all his travels, that so nearly resembled the people of his own state, as did those of Maine. He
                    expressed himself pleased with Indiana, but if he was back in <pb n="220" id="VAA4025-085-3-034"/>
                    Md. again, with his present knowledge and experience, he should most certainly remain there. I found
                    him a fine speciman of the Marylander; frank, open hearted &amp; generous.</p>
            <p>The land about the town, as is also true of nearly all the towns in this part of the country, is low
                    and flat, and produces Fever &amp; Ague. But the soil rich, easy of cultivation, and exceedingly
                    productive. The Churches, Court House, jail, ware houses, &amp; many private residences are
                    built of stone, &amp; look very well. The lime stone, of which they are constructed, is much
                    more durable, &amp; presents a finer appearance than brick. This seems to be a town of
                    considerable business, and promises to become one of the most important in the state. It is now
                    about the same size as Lafayette;<hi rend="sup">22</hi> though, as the canal only passes through it,
                    it is at present, of less importance than that town.</p>
            <p>Soon after leaving Logansport, we found the current in the canal quite rapid, and it being against
                    us, rendered our progress very slow. This was the more vexatious, from the fact that there was a
                    boat but a few rods behind us, that was struggling hard to run by; and another but a few rods in
                    advance, being, as well as the one in the rear, of much lighter draft than our boat, which we were
                    struggling as hard to outstrip. We did not succeed in getting by the boat in
                    advance—owing to some necessary detentions—but we had some source of
                    gratification in the fact, that the one in the rear could'nt come it.<hi rend="sup">23</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Becoming sleepy, I concluded I would try once more to so stow myself away, as to obtain a little
                    sleep. I exchanged berths, so as to obtain one, near a window, where I could get fresh air. The
                    space from the berth to the roof of the cabin was about four feet, so that I now had room enough to
                    turn over. I found this berth quite comfortable, &amp; slept soundly. About four
                    o'clock in the morning we were all aroused by a tremendous racket on, and about the boat,
                    and we all, simultaneously, jumped from our berths and rushed up on deck, to learn what all the

                    the uproar, and on looking ahead we saw that, sure enough, one of the horses &amp; the driver

                    without any serious injury, &amp; the driver getting on a dry suit of clothes, we went on as

                    not only stopped the head way of the boat, but began to carry it down stream. The tow-line remaining
                    still attached to the boat, drew our horse, with the driver on his back, over the railing, into the

                    was very deep, neither horse, or driver experienced any other injury than a good wetting.</p>
            <p>Soon our thoughts reverted to ourselves, and we began to make laudable efforts to preserve our lives,
                    from the dense swarms of large, fat musquetoes, that, with indomitable courage and untiring
                    perseverance, seemed resolved to have a breakfast of our blood. After fighting manfully, for some
                    time, and loosing much blood, I fairly retreated to the cabin: and, jumping into my berth, actually
                    gave up the struggle, &amp; hid myself under the bed clothes. Here, though I could still hear
                    their buzzing, and felt appalled at their cruelty in dealing so unmercifully with a fallen foe, I
                    found that I was comparatively safe from their bloody instruments, &amp; I lay quite comfortably
                    for a couple of hours. On arising again for breakfast, I found them still fresh and vigorous,
                    &amp; their ardor by no means cooled. Of course, breakfast could not be enjoyed; for, beside
                    their buzzing and biting, it was very difficult to get a morsel of food into one's mouth,
                    without taking more or less of them along with it. I succeeded, however, in making a light breakfast
                    without being indebted to many of them for adding to the support of that body, they were treating so
                    blood-thirstily; and afterwards, by dint of smoking and brushing we fairly drove them from the
                    cabin, and then proceeded to make ourselves comfortable, after the most approved method. The most
                    usual manner, with myself, was, to lie at full length upon the fine cushioned seats, and place my
                    carpet bag for the support of my head and shoulders. So expert was I in this custom, that the palm
                    was given to me by all, as being the most successful in finding out comfortable positions. Even Br.
                    A. who had even considered himself first in that way, was, as he frankly acknowledged, forced to
                    give in. About noon, on Friday, passed a little town called Wabash—one of the most
                    beautiful I had seen since I had left home. It is the only one, so far, that is situated on high,
                    rolling land. The town is north of the canal. Between the canal &amp; the <geogName>Wabash
                    river</geogName>, south of the town, is a beautiful tract of bottom land, of exceeding fertility.
                    The land on the north of the canal, being high and hilly, renders the town very healthy, and gives
                    to it something of the appearance of a New England village.</p>
            <p>I learned this day that there was another passenger on board, one, who, I at first supposed was one

                    assisted them in their work. I soon found, upon conversation with him, that he was not what I had
                    supposed him to be, but a rare speciman of the shrewd, genuine Yankee. He was a native of my own
                    state, and, certainly, a rare genius. From his own accounts he had been engaged in almost every
                    thing. Left his native state when 21 years of age—spent 8 years in Mass. as teamster,
                    clerck, conducter upon the railroad &amp;c &amp;c.—had travelled through Canada

                    mason— and was probably once engaged as smuggler.—denies that there is any

            <p>A few miles above Logansport, on the right of the canal, commences the tract of land known as the
                    Indian country. This was ceded to the U.S. last year, by the Miami Indians, who still occupy it.
                    They are to leave it, &amp; go west of the Mississippi in a year or two. The tribe, which was
                    formerly numerous and powerful, has now dwindled to but a small remnant: fading away, as do all the
                    other tribes, before the march of the white man. The Weas, whose country I spoke of, lying south of
                    Lafayette, were once very numerous. In the old records of the Catholic missionary operations among
                    them in former years—which records can still be seen at Vincennes, Ia.—there
                    are recorded the births &amp; deaths of more than a thousand souls, during the brief space of
                    the mission among them. Now they are reduced to only 270, all told. This remnant now lives in the

                    green, they found it difficult to prevent the boat from running against the banks. The pattering of

                            Indiana for $550,000. Of this amount $300,000 was to be applied to the
                            payment of tribal debts, the remainder to be distributed as annuities over a period of
                            twenty years. Certain lands were reserved for various individuals of the tribe, and the
                            federal government was to bear all expense of moving the Miamis to a new reservation of half
                            a million acres in what was designated as Indian country across the Mississippi River in
                            what would become the state of Kansas. Removal did not occur until 1846. Most of the Wea
                            tribes—along with the Kickapoos and Delawares—had apparently moved
                            west following their land cessions in 1818 and 1820. The Kickapoos and probably the Weas
                            were given lands on the Osage River in Indian country. Nellie Armstrong Robertson and

                    noon we arrived at Fort Wayne, and we concluded to leave the boat &amp; remain here until

                    such a manner for four successive days, we were well prepared to appreciate and fully enjoy our neat
                    supper, with fine strawberry sauce, &amp; other fruit that we could have relished under any
                    circumstances, and our nice clean bed. We took an early supper &amp; prepared to take a ride
                    about the town, in order to visit some scenes that we knew could not fail to interest us. Br. Boyd
                    very politely tendered us his services; harnessed his horse into the carriage, and took us all over
                    the town, &amp; around the suburbs. In the west part of the town we found the site of old Fort
                    Wayne, from which the town is named, where Gen. Wayne had his head quarters for some time, during
                    the Indian wars of this region, and who is generally known in this country as "Mad
                    Anthony". The site of the fort is the most commanding point in the whole neighborhood. The
                    Fort was about 100 feet square. The ditch is still to be seen, and also the stumps of the pickets.
                    The well that supplied the fort with water is still to be seen, &amp; still has abundance of
                    good cool water. The principal log building of the fort is yet standing, as a memorial of former

                    large Indian came, at the time the fort was occupied by our men; and supposing himself entirely
                    beyond the reach of their rifles, turned round and slapped his back sides at them, in derision. But
                    it so happened that he failed in his reckoning, for a "hunter from Kentucky"

                    distance, &amp; I know not that it has ever been measured; but the land being level we had a
                    good view of the point where the Indian stood—far across, on the other side of the
                    Maumee—and according to the best of our judgment, in measuring distance with the eye, we

                            "one of the cleverest, trickiest, and wealthiest half-breeds in the western
                            country," was the chief who led the Miami tribe at treaty councils from 1818
                            through 1840. He conducted the treaty negotiations in 1840 in which the Miamis ceded the
                            last of their tribal lands in Indiana. Richardville, an astute businessman, amassed a large
                            fortune in his trade with the Indians and in other business ventures. He and his family
                            received large personal reserves of land in all treaties with the government and were
                            exempted from removal west to the Indian country. Richardville died in 1841 at his home on
                            the St. Mary's River near Fort Wayne. Bert Anson, "Chief Francis

            <p>Harmer's men were divided into two companies. One was to approach from the south &amp;
                    cross the Maumee at fig. 4. The other was to pass up and cross the Little St. Josephs, a little
                    above fig. 2. at the same time the first company crossed the Maumee; and thus both companies would
                    be able to attack the Indians, who were encamped on this little peninsula, within the dotted line,
                    at the same time, and drive them down to the point of land toward the fort— where the
                    water of Maumee is very deep— thus give them no chance for escape. The plan was a very
                    good one, but by some mismanagement the Indians were made acquainted with it, &amp; also the <hi rend="u">time</hi> when the attempt would be made to destroy them. Consequently, on the night of
                    the contemplated attack, they were wide awake, and, sending a party to intercept those who were to
                    come by the Little St. Joseph's, the remainder, four or five hundred in number, secreted
                    themselves in a dense thicket, (which still remains,) on the bank of the Maumee, at an Indian ford,
                    where the main body of the army was to cross. Here they waited for our men, fully prepared to give
                    them a warm reception, while the approaching party supposed them to be quietly sleeping in their
                    wigwams. The brave, noble hearted, self sacrificing lovers of their country, entered the ford
                    unconscious of the lurking danger, with hearts already swelling with triumph at the anticipated easy
                    conquest of the whole body of Indians. They were unmolested by their secret foe, until nearly the
                    who1 company was in the river, and the foremost had well nigh reached the opposite shore, when the
                    Indians pierced the still night air with their shrill war whoop, and at the same moment commenced a
                    rapid deadly fire upon our poor devoted countrymen. Before those, who survived the first fire, had
                    recovered from the shock, it was too late to make any effort, except for their own safety in flight.

                    the small company, 187 were killed. Richardville was in the strife, and often described it in after
                    years. He says, the river was bloody for a great distance, &amp; the dead bodies so thick that
                    he could easily pass from one side of the river to the other upon them, while taking their scalps.
                    They now sleep in one common grave on the bank of the river, and sighs of regret, at their unhappy
                    fate, from the heart of the passing stranger, oft mingle with the gentle breeze that murmurs in the
                    spreading branches that shade their last resting place. The other company learned their danger in
                    time to avoid it &amp; but few of them were injured.</p>
            <p>An incident was related to me while in the town, that is illustrative of the bravery and hardihood of
                    the soldiers of that period. It had become necessary to send an express from Fort Defiance, on the
                        <geogName>Maumee river</geogName>, 50 miles from this place, to Fort Wayne. The duty was one of
                    exceeding danger and doubtful success, on account of the great number of Indians around and between
                    the two forts. The commanding officer at Fort Defiance called for a voluntire to this dangerous
                    service. A man by the name of Settlefield stepped forward and offered to become the bearer of the
                    despatches, provided he could have the privelege of selecting a horse from all that were in the
                    garrison. This was willingly granted to him, &amp; he chose a noble steed belonging to one of
                    the officers. The officer was very unwilling to let the horse go, as he prized him very highly, but
                    he at length consented. Settlefield prepared himself, mounted his high-mettled charger, and rushed,
                    at the top of his speed, through the opened gates, among the Indians that surrounded the fort,
                    crying out to them, at the same time, with all his might. The Indians were so surprised at the
                    suddenness of the movement, that it was some seconds before they recovered themselves sufficiently
                    to attempt to stop him. They then commenced firing upon him from all sides, but in the hurry of the
                    movement none of the balls happened to take effect, &amp; the noble animal he rode soon carried
                    him beyond their reach. Many of the savages followed in pursuit, but they were soon left far behind.
                    He had proceeded about half the distance, when he suddenly came upon a small body of Indians, just
                    in the act of drinking at a small rivulet. He was too near to retreat undiscovered, &amp; his
                    only means of escape was to rush past them with all possible speed. With a yell of defiance he swept
                    passed them, and before they could take murderous aim, was beyond their reach. The Indians knew him,
                    and were aware that it was important for them to prevent his reaching Fort Wayne, if possible. They
                    consequently started in rapid pursuit; but although his horse had already run nearly 30 miles, over
                    a desparately bad road, he still continued to outstrip their Indian ponies, which they would
                    exchange for fresh ones, as often as they became too much fatigued to proceed farther. Settlefield
                    arrived within about ten miles of the fort, when his horse, <pb n="229" id="VAA4025-085-3-043"/>
                    that had run the whole distance, fell, being completely spent, &amp; he was forced to proceed on
                    foot. Being a fleet runner he succeeded in eluding his pursuers and arrived at the fort a little
                    after midnight. The fort was besieged, at the time, by a large number of Indians, &amp; they
                    were lying around the fort in every direction. Supposing that they would sleep at that time if they
                    slept at all, he carefully approached the garrison and getting down on his hands &amp; knees,
                    crawled up to the gate. The ditch near the gate was filled with Indians, and he crawled so near
                    them, that he distinctly heard them breathe. With a palpitating heart he reached the gate, gave the
                    counter sign, and was joyfully received by his friends, having run the gauntlet in safety.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>

            <p>The inhabitants of Fort Wayne, so far as I was able to judge from my short stay among them, are
                    exceedingly open-hearted and hospitable. I have never, in all my wandering, spent the same number of
                    days, in a strange town, so pleasantly, as I did here. There was no cold formality, &amp;
                    unnecessary cerimony, but a frank, warm hearted reception, wherever I called, or was introduced.
                    Never shall I forget the noble people of Fort Wayne. I felt that I was at home, &amp; that I
                    could willingly live and die with them.</p>
            <p>Sunday morning went to a neat little M. church for worship, and was most agreeably entertained and
                    profited by an excellent discourse from Br. Ames. This was the first pewed church I had seen among
                    the Methodists, west of the Alleghanies. It was beautifully and neatly finished. The pews are after
                    the modern plan, without doors. Only about half of them are rented, the rest left free, usually
                    every other one. Upon the top of each pew is a strip of Black Walnut, wide enough to hold a note
                    book when singing. The pulpit is also made of B. Walnut, which being highly polished, presents a
                    rich and beautiful appearance. The congregation appeared very intelligent, displayed a better taste
                    in their dress than is usually seen in this country, and were also very genteel. I felt as though I
                    had got back to New-England, and was not only pleased but delighted. At 6 P.M. I attempted to preach
                    to the people. A violent thunder storm commenced about the meeting hour, but yet the people flocked
                    out, and the congregation was quite large. They were very attentive, &amp; I felt that I was
                    speaking once more to an Eastern Congregation. After meeting, went home with Br. J. <list type="footnotes">

                    spirited, wide-awake young man for captain. Among the passengers were three
                    "Friends" [Quakers] who were very pleasant travelling companions. The crew aboard
                    the boat was good enough, but the horses, &amp; the manner in which they were kept, and the
                    manner in which we had to wait for them, at every station, to be found &amp; brought forth from

                    themselves upon our attention. This line of boats is known as "Mahan's

                    whithersoever they list—and we now found that matters had not been exaggerated. Each set
                    of horses was forced to drag us for 25 or 30 miles. And <hi rend="u">such</hi> horses I never saw

                    bones, until I wondered that they were not all broken. About 4 o'clock Tues. morning, we
                    arrived at the first station, where we were to change horses. It was a very easy matter to
                    "untackle" those we had been using, but by no means an easy one to
                    "tackle up" those we wanted; for the simple reason that one of them was not to be
                    found. No one seemed to have any charge of them, or could tell whither the missing horse had
                    strayed, except that he had gone into the woods. The captain, who was brother to the owner of the
                    line, in the course of his inquiries came to a sleepy looking Jonathan, who, it seemed, was the one
                    who should have had the horses in readiness, and demanded where the other horse was. "Wall,
                    captain" said he, scratching his head, "I s'pose he's gone off
                    into the woods" So here we were obliged to wait 3 or 4 hours, while a number of men by
                    ranging around through the woods, succeeded in finding the missing animal. It is doubtful if they
                    would have found him during the whole day, had not the captain gone in person to assist them. He
                    succeeded at last in coming up to the animal, when, observing the driver—the sleepy David
                    of whom I have spoken—within a few rods of it, enquired if he had yet found the
                    horse—which was in plain sight before him—"No" said he in a
                    whining, drawling tone "and I'll be dam'd if I b'lieve that that
                    are hoss is any where about here, any how". The captain soon convinced him that the horse
                    was in existence, &amp; ordered him to stir himself, and harness it. He seemed, however, to be
                    in no hurry, but moved as though he was perfect master of his own time. Our patience was nearly
                    exhausted before we got under way again, &amp; when we did move, the scamp of driver seemed very
                    much inclined to the belief that our progress would be slow. Not through any pity he felt for the
                    poor animals he drove—for one would suppose from his movements that he had no feelings,
                    save such as are common to the sloth—but because he was too outrageous lazy to cause them
                    to go in any other way, than just as they chose to go. His appearance when mounted upon one of the
                    horses, was quite amusing. His leggs— much too long for his tattered <hi rend="u">yellow</hi> pantaloons—pending to which were large sprawling feet, naked &amp; yet
                    covered, were dangling by the sides of the horse, in the most clownish manner conceivable. His coat,
                    the rags of which seemed bidding good bye to each other, might have been large enough, when new,
                    which must have been <pb n="232" id="VAA4025-085-3-046"/> 5 or 6 years previous, but was now only
                    sufficient to cover a part of his back, the skirts reaching down just to where his leggs commenced.
                    His slouched hat &amp; whip completed his equipment. The captain soon became impatient with his
                    slow movements and ordered him to drive up faster. But the lad thought himself master of his own
                    motions &amp; heeded not the admonitions and warnings, that were freely lavished upon him. The
                    captain soon became exasperated, &amp;, jumping upon the tow-path, demanded the whip, that he
                    might drive the horses himself. The driver refused to give it up, and a struggle ensued in which the
                    poor one eyed scoundrel—for he had but one eye, &amp; that was a little grey
                    one—was dragged from the horse; shaken lustily by the <hi rend="u">lusty</hi> little
                    captain; then squeezed "right smart" under the captain's little body
                    &amp; in his "warm embrace"; then choked by the captain's little
                    hand, till his face became blacker than ever, &amp; "last of all" thrown over
                    the bank into the bushes, by the <hi rend="u">strong</hi> little captain, and left there to learn
                    better manners.</p>

                            Battle of Fallen Timbers at the rapids of the Maumee River, southwest of present-day Toledo.
                            This victory led to the Treaty of Greenville in 1795 and for a number of years effectively
                            ended Indian hostilities in much of the Old Northwest. <hi rend="i">Ibid.,</hi> 300-306. See

                    arriving at the wharf, the keeper of the Indiana House, which was only 2 or 3 rods from the landing,
                    cried out at the very top of his voice, to let us &amp; the public in general know that <hi rend="u">his</hi> was the house that we ought to stop at, if we wanted to have every thing
                    straight. He did'nt send out runners to trouble passengers: his house recommended itself. A
                    carriage should be ready to take us to the Steam boat whenever we wished to go, free of expense:
                    and, moreover, we were at liberty to regale ourselves on iced lemonade whenever we wished it,
                    &amp;c &amp;c. Learning from a fellow passenger, that this was the best Hotel in town, we

                    saw a boat approaching the wharf, and on enquiring of this clerk, found that they were to start
                    immediately for D. In a few minutes we were on board, &amp; on our way out of the mouth of the
                    river into the beautiful Lake Erie.</p>
            <p>The Wabash &amp; Erie canal affords the greatest facilities of transportation to the farmer
                    &amp; merchant of the Maumee &amp; Wabash vallies—two of the most fertile regions
                    in the whole world. By means of this canal, the farmer in the upper Wabash—which is the
                    most fertile part of that valley—finds a ready market for all his surplus produce, at a
                    good price. I could but notice the difference of the price of grain on the canal, and in the
                    southern part of the State. Soon after leaving Madison, I saw <hi rend="u">corn</hi> selling for <hi rend="u">ten cents</hi> a bushel, and a drug at that: on the canal it went quick, without any
                    parleying, for 37<hi rend="sup">1/2</hi> a bushel. Before this canal was constructed, all the
                    produce was transported by wagons to the river, &amp; thence conveyed in flat boats to a
                    southern market, where, after all the labor &amp; expense of transportation, it generally
                    commanded but a small price. A new day has now dawned upon the agriculturist of this region. Now,
                    with but moderate industry &amp; common prudence, he cannot fail of becoming independent,
                    &amp; even wealthy. There is no end to the fertility of his farm, and for every bushel that he
                    raises, he has a convenient &amp; never failing market. The people of Indiana have been
                    visionary &amp; <hi rend="u">childish</hi> in most of their projects for internal improvement,
                    but in this they have not failed, <pb n="235" id="VAA4025-085-3-049"/> &amp; it seems destined
                    to fully realize their most sanguine expectations.<hi rend="sup">36</hi> That part of the canal from
                    Ft. Wayne to Toledo is much superior to the other; being 60 feet wide from the top of the banks
                    &amp; 40 from the bottom, while the other part ranges only about 40 &amp; 25. There are some
                    good line boats—for freight principally—with gentlemanly commanders &amp;
                    good strong teams: but there is not a good line of packet boats. Indeed, we found the accommodations
                    of the line boat, on which we travelled as far as Ft. Wayne, superior to those of the packet in
                    which we completed our journey to Toledo. However, the canal has been opened but a short time, and
                    there is no doubt but there will soon be a good line of packets established. Until that time, I have
                    no desire to travel on this canal again. I had intended to go this way home, on my return to Maine,
                    but I now determined to go any other way in preference.</p>

            <p>Abraham Lincoln led the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> through the most trying time in its history. The Civil War encompassed a significant
                    internal struggle, testing the strength of the union of states, the power of the federal government
                    versus its constituent state governments, and the validity of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Constitution. Because President Lincoln faced political situations for which there were
                    sometimes no precedents, and because he felt that his primary duty was to preserve the Union, he was
                    at times led to make hasty executive decisions and to place his own interpretation on the
                    Constitution. State governors, taking their cue from Lincoln, sometimes followed his example and
                    chose an expedient rather than a thoroughly and constitutionally proper course to achieve their
                    aims. As a result, Lincoln and the national administration as well as several state administrations
                    were involved in cases in which their particular interpretations of the Constitution were
                    challenged. One such landmark case that ultimately involved both the state of Indiana and the
                    federal government was <hi rend="i">ex parte Milligan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To understand the Milligan case fully one must recognize the Civil War context in which it took
                    place. It is too simple to envision the Civil War as a "War between the States,"
                    in which northerners were uniformly pitted against southerners and vice versa. The situation was far
                    more complex. Northern sympathizers existed in the South, and Confederate sympathizers existed in
                    the North.</p>

                    Republicans. Particularly in the Midwest, however, one discrete minority sector of the Democratic
                    opposition was comprised of radical dissident groups opposed to the war, abolition, the primacy of
                    the federal over the state government, and the draft. Those anti-administration and pro-Confederate
                    midwestern groups were dubbed Copperheads ("snakes in the grass") by
                    Lincoln's Republican supporters, who viewed them as subversive and traitorous. Among these
                    groups were the secret societies called the Knights of the Golden Circle and the American Knights.
                    The latter eventually merged with another such group, the Sons of Liberty, which by 1864 allegedly
                    existed to some degree in forty counties throughout the state of Indiana.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The one person most clearly associated with the Copperheads was Clement L. Vallandigham of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, the supreme commander of the Sons of Liberty and possibly the figure who inspired the
                    well-known Edward Everett Hale story, "The Man Without a Country." Among the more
                    outspoken and radical of Vallandigham's cohorts were leaders of the Hoosier chapters of the
                    Sons of Liberty: Harrison H. Dodd, an Indianapolis printer; William H. Bowles, a physician and
                    former Mexican War general from French Lick Springs; Horace Heffren, a <placeName>

                    </placeName> politician; Andrew Humphreys of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Greene County</region>
                    </placeName>; and Lambdin P. Milligan, an attorney from Huntington, who also served as a
                    "peace" candidate in the Indiana 1864 Democratic gubernatorial primary.</p>
            <p>To be sure, the Indiana Sons of Liberty were likely firm in their radical opposition to Lincoln
                    Republicans and the war. Nevertheless, their number and collective voice in the Democratic party was
                    of minor consequence, as witnessed by the results of the 1864 Democratic gubernatorial primary, in
                    which the moderate and popular candidate, Joseph E. McDonald, won handily over Milligan by a vote of
                    1,097 to 160, thus capturing 87 percent of the Democratic voters.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> By winning
                    the primary election McDonald was the man who was to run in October against Oliver P. Morton, the
                    incumbent Republican governor, a shrewd, controversial political figure who, until his death in
                    1877, ruled Indiana politics.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Although clearly the losers in the Democratic
                    primary and a small minority within the party, the Sons of Liberty were to play a signal and

                    constitutional history.</p>

            <p>The Milligan case effectively began on September 3, 1864, when General Alvin P. Hovey, the chief
                    military officer in Indianapolis, arrested Dodd for alleged treason and scheduled his trial for less
                    than three weeks later, on the 22nd of that month. Shortly after the Dodd trial had begun, on
                    October 5-7, the military also arrested for treason Milligan, Bowles, Humphreys, Heffren, and
                    Stephen Horsey as well as Joseph J. Bingham, the state chairman of the Democratic party and editor
                    of the <hi rend="i">Sentinel,</hi> the Democratic newspaper in Indianapolis. Their trial began very
                    quickly, two weeks later on October 21. During his trial Dodd escaped from prison and fled to
                    Canada, a fact that seemed to indicate his guilt and a fact that did much to prejudice the court and
                    public opinion in the other conspiracy trial involving Bingham, Milligan, and the other arrested and
                    accused Sons of Liberty. The treason trials were carried on during the months of October and
                    November, 1864, in the military court, which eventually, as expected, found the conspirators guilty
                    of treason and sentenced them to hang on May 19, 1865, the following year.</p>
            <p>After their sentence was handed down, Milligan and the other convicted men were sent to a military
                    prison in Columbus, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, to await their execution. The condemned men did not, however, accept their fate
                    passively. Milligan, a lawyer by profession, was convinced that he and his comrades had been
                    unfairly denied a trial by jury and that, in fact, the whole proceeding was unconstitutional because
                    they had been arrested and tried by military courts instead of the civil courts.</p>
            <p>The fact that Governor Morton could have had alleged traitors arrested by the military and that he
                    could have suspended the writ of <hi rend="i">habeas corpus</hi> in this case is a constitutional
                    issue that plagued the Lincoln presidency. It was a problem that was not fully addressed until the
                    Supreme Court decision on Milligan's case issued shortly after Lincoln's death.</p>
            <p>Morton's decision to use the military to arrest and try Milligan and his comrades reflected
                    the precedent Lincoln had set in his suspension of the <hi rend="i">habeas corpus</hi> writ in other
                    arrests, including that of Vallandigham in 1863. At that time, when Vallandigham's fellow
                    Democrats complained about the unconstitutionality of Vallandigham's arrest, Lincoln wrote
                    a reply explaining his reasons for these unusual arrests. Samuel Klaus, who has written a major
                    study of <hi rend="i">ex parte Milligan,</hi> summarizes: "Military arrests and trial by
                    military commission were not unconstitutional, Lincoln declared. The enemy had pervaded everywhere.
                    The means used to break the Union power were such that the civil courts could not deal with their
                        suppression."<hi rend="sup">4</hi> As Allan Nevins, the distinguished <list type="footnotes">

                            unconstitutional and yet necessary in order to save the Union, it shows that the
                            constitution is defective in not allowing the government the proper means of protecting
                            itself. That Lincoln used this power with discretion and fore-bearance there is no doubt.
                            … But, nevertheless, injustice was sometimes done. His subordinates had not
                            always their master's nature … they sometimes arrested without excuse,
                            and were sometimes brutally severe in the arrest. Such things are perhaps inevitable when a

            <p>When Milligan was imprisoned, he hired legal counsel to argue that his constitutional rights had been
                    violated by the government. First of all, the Constitution does not clearly give the president, the

                    the rest of the imprisoned Copperheads were only in jail for safekeeping until the conclusion of the
                    war. Afterward they would be released. And in January, 1865, the surrender of the South seemed close
                    at hand.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, less than three months after McDonald's visit to the capital, General Robert E. Lee
                    surrendered to Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Courthouse. Had Lincoln not been assassinated shortly
                    after the war's end, Milligan would likely have been set free. However, Andrew Johnson
                    stepped into the White House not knowing of Lincoln's intentions and planning to go ahead
                    with the executions as scheduled. It was at that point that Milligan decided to take legal action.</p>
            <p>On May 10, 1865, the prisoners filed suit in the circuit court of Indianapolis to appeal the
                    violation of their constitutional rights. The case eventually went to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Supreme Court. The state government in Indiana and then the federal government under
                    Johnson did not back down but continued to believe that Milligan was guilty as charged and deserving
                    of the death penalty. Certainly there was no doubt about Milligan's behavior. He was
                    unquestionably and self-admittedly involved in anti-Union activities during the war. He and his
                    legal counsel, however, pursued the constitutional aspect of his case. Regardless of his guilt
                    Milligan was a citizen of Indiana, a state not in rebellion or in a war zone and a state in which
                    the civil courts were in full operation. He maintained, therefore, that he should not have been
                    tried by a military court and that, consequently, his trial had violated his constitutional rights
                    and had not given him the benefit of the constitutional guarantee of writ of <hi rend="i">habeas
                        corpus.</hi> After much deliberation, the Supreme Court, on April 3, 1866, voted in
                    Milligan's favor; and Milligan and his cohorts were set free. The decision was a monumental
                    one in terms of constitutional interpretation of the writ of <hi rend="i">habeas corpus</hi> and the
                    rights of an executive officer in times of war or national crisis.</p>
            <p>The dimensions of the Milligan case in terms of <placeName>

                    there is another aspect of the case that has not been so well documented. If, as stated earlier, the
                    Sons of Liberty clearly comprised a small radical fringe group in the Indiana of 1864 and if they
                    posed no real threat to the stability of the state, why then were they brought to a widely
                    publicized military trial and given such a severe sentence? Study of this question reveals the
                    bitter political warfare in the state of Indiana and the willingness of embattled Republicans to
                    magnify the activities of a small <list type="footnotes">

                    game of politics. Particularly important in the political context of the Milligan case is the
                    enormous power of an intensely partisan press.</p>
            <p>When former Indiana Attorney General Joseph McDonald won the Indiana Democratic primary election and
                    became the party's candidate for governor, he found himself placed in the midst of a
                    difficult race against the powerful Republican incumbent, Oliver P. Morton. McDonald was an acute
                    and astute critic of Morton's policies. Both men were accomplished speakers and, during the
                    months before the state election on October 11, 1864, frequently debated one another throughout the
                    state. McDonald and his fellow Democrats argued that "the Lincoln administration was a
                    failure and that peace and reunion could come only through a Democratic victory."<hi rend="sup">10</hi> More specifically, McDonald recognized and publicized the weaknesses in the
                    Morton administration. Among other things Morton seemed to have mishandled state funds. More
                    important, the Union army did not seem to be faring well during the spring of 1864, and Morton had,
                    consequently, succumbed to pressures from Washington to draft increasing numbers of Hoosiers.</p>
            <p>As one historian points out, Morton had promised the citizens of Indiana in February, 1864, that
                    Washington's request for 200,000 men would be the last.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> But he then
                    offered the federal government an additional 20,000 short-term men in April. The farmers of Indiana,
                    who might have been willing to serve in the Union army during the winter months, were loath to do so
                    during the spring planting season. With Hoosiers feeling the cold pinch of the draft for a war that
                    registered many battlefield casualties, Lincoln's demand in July for still another 25,000
                    Indiana conscripts to be drafted in September was a blow to Morton and to his campaign. Moreover, so
                    many men serving in the army and away from the polls on election day must have given Morton and the
                    Republicans much cause for concern.</p>
            <p>During the summer of 1864 Morton and McDonald seemed evenly matched. McDonald could comfortably
                    exploit the weak spots in Morton's record as governor. What Morton and his fellow
                    Republicans needed, therefore, was an issue to use against McDonald and the Democrats. This they
                    found in the Sons of Liberty and in their alleged subversive activities as exposed in a report on
                    Copperhead activities in Indiana, prepared and issued by General Henry B. Carrington.</p>

            <p>The military commander of the District of Indiana, Carrington was hardly politically impartial. He
                    was a staunch Republican and a not surprisingly strong supporter of Governor Morton, who had, in
                    fact, saved Carrington's career when the general had been threatened with loss of his
                    command for charges of drunkenness and neglect of duty.<hi rend="sup">12</hi> Perhaps because of his
                    own political zeal and perhaps, as one historian believes, because of his debt to Morton, Carrington
                    undertook a covert operation to infiltrate and expose the Sons of Liberty in Indiana.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> To do this, he employed a number of seemingly unqualified detectives, chief among them
                    Felix G. Stidger, who became the key witness in the Milligan <hi rend="i">et al.</hi> treason trial.
                    Stidger had no credentials as an undercover detective, for, according to his own testimony, he had
                    spent two or three years "in the dry goods business" and before then had been
                    "a carpenter, and served in the army."<hi rend="sup">14</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the basis of information provided by Stidger, who, as a part of his undercover duty, became a
                    member of the Sons of Liberty under the alias of J. J. Grundy,<hi rend="sup">15</hi> and on the
                    basis of rumor and hearsay probably colored by his own political biases, Carrington, on June 28,
                    1864, produced and presented to Governor Morton what came to be known as "The Carrington
                    Report," ‘ which painted a picture of a secret Indiana Copperhead society with
                    some 30,000 members in the state plotting to overthrow the state government and abet the Confederacy
                    so that the rebels could move across the <placeName>

                    </placeName> and penetrate into Union territory in Indiana.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> In his report
                    Carrington not only exposed the Sons of Liberty and their plans but also published the secret rites
                    and rituals of their meetings and inductions. In the view of historian Frank L. Klement,
                    "Most of Carrington's contentions … had no basis in fact, making the
                    whole little more than political propaganda."<hi rend="sup">17</hi> Surely
                    Carrington's report was not completely fabricated and likely contained much truth about a
                    lunatic fringe political group. To what extent political propaganda was Carrington's aim is
                    not clear. What is clear, however <list type="footnotes">

                    report by the Republican press and by the Republican politicians.</p>
            <p>Logically, the exposure of a secret society with its rituals and plans would essentially terminate
                    the effectiveness and life of such a group. Rather than seeing "The Carrington
                    Report" as a way to bring about an end to the Sons of Liberty, Morton and the Republican
                    newspapers saw in the report a new issue around which to center Morton's troubled
                    gubernatorial campaign. Within a short time after Carrington's report was published,
                    Morton's campaign speeches and the Indianapolis Republican newspapers, the Indianapolis <hi rend="i">Daily Gazette</hi> and the Indianapolis <hi rend="i">Daily Journal,</hi> relentlessly
                    hammered away at the Copperhead subversive threat, both nationally and in Indiana, and at the fact
                    that the Copperheads were all affiliated with the Democratic party. Although it was never stated
                    that Morton's opponent, McDonald, was himself a Copperhead, it was clearly implied that his
                    supporters were subversives and traitors who would come into power if McDonald were elected.</p>
            <p>A first line of attack in the Republican newspapers was to applaud the patriotism of Carrington and
                    Morton and then to paint a portrait of the Copperhead conspiracy as a complex, highly dangerous,
                    cleverly constructed group posing a significant threat to the life, liberty, and pursuit of
                    happiness of every man, woman, and child in Indiana and the nation. References and parallels to the
                    Tories of 1776 and to notorious traitors like Benedict Arnold and Catiline were common in the
                    newspapers' lead articles. Typical of the journalistic rhetoric were the inflammatory
                    articles of the Indianapolis <hi rend="i">Daily Gazette.</hi> On August 1, for example, that
                    newspaper published part of "The Carrington Report," and, in an article headlined
                    "S of L," said of the contents of the report: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>It is shown that the members of this order [Sons of Liberty] place the rules and oaths of the
                            Order above the obligations of the laws of the land, is inimical to the constitution and the
                            Union, and propose to levy war upon the Government to prevent it from performing all of its
                            proper functions and duties. To fly in the face of this evidence, and try to appease the
                            popular indignation by the assertion that the leaders and members of this treasonable
                            organization are as honest, capable and patriotic as Governor Morton, Gen. Carrington or
                            others who are battling for the Union, is labor thrown away. … We have no doubt
                            that A. H. Stephens, John Bell, and many others among the traitors of the land, were once
                            sincere and devoted citizens of the <placeName>

                            </placeName>, and never meditated becoming abettors in the hellish work of treason. Yet they
                            are none the less traitors now—none the less deserving of the nation's
                            scorn and contempt. Benedict Arnold was once a true soldier and citizen; but when he turned
                            traitor, and the evidence was made public, the fact of his former loyalty did not set it
                            aside. … A generous public may tolerate their presence so long as the public
                            safety is not jeopardized thereby; but they must be vigilantly watched and debarred from all
                            positions of trust or confidence.<hi rend="sup">18</hi>

            <p>The Indianapolis <hi rend="i">Daily Journal,</hi> the city's other Republican newspaper,
                    resorted to similar rhetoric. On July 30 it published the Carrington report preceded by thirteen

                    </quote> On the same day, the paper's article commenting on the report began with the
                    headline "The Serpent's Den Unearthed." The <hi rend="i">Journal</hi>
                    then went on to say that the newspaper had been warning Hoosiers all along about the serpent-like
                    Sons of Liberty and then suggested that that organization was the active element in the Democratic
                    party: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>We have heretofore warned the people of Indiana that there existed within this State a
                            secret, oath-bound political organization, connected with informing the active part of the
                            Democratic party, and that the object and purpose of this order were hostile to the

                            </placeName>, and in active sympathy with the rebel chiefs and rebel armies. …
                            Notwithstanding the fact that these warnings have been repeated, and that belief was general
                            that there was a secret order which gave shape and tone to the utterances of the Democratic
                            party, as in mockery of Democracy it styles itself, few will be prepared for the expose of
                            treason and vilainy that we lay before our readers this morning.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>

                    Democratic party as a whole.</p>
            <p>Very quickly, such rhetoric developed and expanded, so that there could be no neutral stand on the
                    Copperheads. The <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> editors wrote: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>Once the Copperhead conspiracy became a moral conflict in which there was only one position to be
                    taken, then the newspaper could take its second line of attack in which moral and political
                    positions became the same and in which the Democrats became the conspirators and fellow travelers.
                    The <hi rend="i">Gazette</hi> article just quoted eventually concluded: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>That the Democratic party as a party, and in its entirety, is engaged in this conspiracy with

                            that a treasonable organization of the kind alleged exists there can be no doubt; and that
                            it exists within the present Democratic party, being composed mainly of members of that
                            political organization, is also beyond doubt. It is attached, politically, to the machinery
                            of the Democratic party, embraces a formidable number—doubtless a large majority
                            of its supporters, is contrived and engineered by some of the most powerful leaders of that
                            party, and is intending to use the party as an instrument,—to operate by it and
                            through it, and to control it for the accomplishment of its infamous and treasonable ends.
                            It is now insidiously leading the party in a course which, if not soon arrested, must
                            inevitably give the party wholly into its hands and the hands of traitors and enemies of the

                    Indiana Democrats for the purpose of sedition and civil unrest throughout the state: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            It is the "Peace" men preparing for war! the "Democracy"
                            arming themselves for resisting the draft, and for compelling the authorities to let them
                            have a "fair election!" In short, it is the Copperhead Democracy preparing
                            for revolution and civil war! That is just what it means, what it is intended for and what,
                            if not at once stopped, it will lead to, as sure as the sun rises and nets. Civil

                  <p>No. 1 is a seemingly harmless portmanteau.</p>
                  <p>No. 2 exhibits its internal arrangement. An alarm-clock, with the bell removed, set to any
                            given time, springs the lock of a gun, the hammer of which, striking and exploding a cap,
                            placed upon a tube filled with powder, fires a train connected with a bottle of Greek fire.
                            The explosion of these combustibles ignites thc tow, saturated with turpentine, with which
                            the remainder of the portmanteau is filled.</p>
                  <p>No. 3 is a conical shell, three and a half inches in diameter.</p>
                  <p>Nos. 4 and 5 exhibit the same unscrewed.</p>
                  <p>No. 7 is a case to contain powder, with a nipple for n cap at its upper end. No. 7 screws
                            into G, thc space between the two being tilled with Greek fire. Nos. G and 7 make an
                            interior shell, fitting loosely in No. 3, and which, on striking any object, explodes the
                            cap on the top of 7.</p>
                  <p>No. 8 is a spherical shell, or hand-grenade.</p>
                  <p>Nos. 9 and 10 exhibit the same unscrewed.</p>
                  <p>No. 11 is an interior shell, with nine nipples for caps, fitting loosely, so as to leave
                            space for concussion. No. 11, also, is made to unscrew in the center, to hold No. 12, a
                            small vial containing Greek fire—the space between the two being filled with
                            powder. The drop ping of this shell a quarter of a yard from the floor, invariably explodes
                            one or more of the caps. The string attached to No. 8 enables a person to throw it a greater
                            distance, as a sling, with less danger of explosion in his own hand.</p>
                  <p>No. 13 is a letter in secret cipher, sometimes employed by thc Order of Sons of Liberty in
                            their communication with each other, upon matters requiring secrecy.</p>

                    bear arms was violated and that "the right to bear arms includes the right to purchase and
                    sell arms." Furthermore, and more important, the paper went on to point out that, quoting
                    the Constitution, "The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers
                    and effects, against unreasonable search or seizure shall not be violated." In the same
                    angry article the <hi rend="i">Sentinel</hi> also raised the extremely significant question as to
                    the propriety of the military's involvement in what should properly be a purely civil
                    matter: "Indiana is not under martial law. The laws and the decrees of her civil courts can
                    be enforced. No opposition or resistance has yet occurred to the civil authorities. The Constitution
                    says ‘the military should be kept in strict subordination to the civil
                    power.’" It is then argued the seizure was carried out "for partisan
                    purposes and for partisan effect," Finally, the article concludes that the use of martial
                    law and the abrogation of civil rights puts the concept of democracy in jeopardy: "If the
                    military are no longer to be kept in strict subordination to the civil power, then military
                    despotism is upon us, and the people are no longer governed and protected by law, but are subject to
                    the arbitrary caprices and will of a military commandant. Are the people prepared for this surrender
                    of their political rights?" Clearly the Democratic newspaper tried to use the theoretical
                    and abstract issues of constitutional protections to counter the Republican newspaper's
                    appeal to the psychological fears and insecurities of its readers raised by the image of a satanic
                    Democratic force seeking insurrection from within.</p>
            <p>The strategy of striking fear of subversion and armed revolt in the hearts and minds of Hoosiers that
                    was used by the Republican papers becomes precisely the strategy used by Governor Morton in his
                    reelection campaign speeches directed against his opponent McDonald in particular and against the
                    Democrats in general. Avoiding the Democratic charges of his corruption and misuse of government
                    funds, Morton uses the Carrington report to deflect McDonald's criticisms of the Morton
                    administration and to focus the election instead on the issue of the Sons of Liberty and the
                    Copperheads and on the idea that although all Democrats are not card-carrying members of the Sons of
                    Liberty, those that are not are nearly all fellow travelers. The Dodd affair, then, gave Morton a
                    powerful club to swing at his Democratic opponents. His response to the seizure of arms at
                    Dodd's office was that it was the proof of the general charges he has been making of
                    Democratic subversion. In a speech following the Dodd seizure and quoted in the <hi rend="i">Daily
                        Gazette,</hi> the governor proudly boasted, "What have you discovered now that I have
                    not frequently warned you of for the past eighteen months? I have told the people of Indiana that

            <p>In that same speech Morton cleverly directs attention away from Dodd as an individual and directs it
                    toward the nameless but obviously Democratic powers which, Morton argues, Dodd serves: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>but the men who invent the lies and put them in circulation are the guilty ones. Are more
                            guilty than even Dodd. … He is not most to blame in this matter. But the men who
                            have advised him and encouraged him. … Five of the candidates on the Democratic
                            State ticket are members of the order. This society is the nucleus of treason in Indiana;
                            but it does not contain all or the worst part of it.</p>
                    </quote> Without naming names Morton let his audience name the names for themselves. And those names
                    are all, he suggested, on the ballot as Democrats: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>It is not necessary that I should enter on the individual task of naming these persons who
                            are far worse than Dodd. You generally know who they are. What you want is to be on your
                            guard; to be prepared to resist these men in a legal manner, and to vote them down in the
                            coming election. … And I am glad to believe that the U.S. authorities have at
                            last awakened to the true condition of affairs in Indiana, and that they will enforce the
                            law and promptly arrest and punish all who can be convicted of plotting treason in our
                            midst.</p>
                    </quote> Morton not only implicated his opponents as Dodd's abettors and sympathizers but
                    in his speech shrewdly set the stage for the arrests and treason trials that followed in the ensuing
                    weeks.</p>
            <p>Whether the Carrington report and the Dodd affair were fortunate opportunities for Morton and the
                    Republican papers or whether Morton orchestrated the events remains unclear. With
                    Carrington's subservience to Morton, however, and with the almost perfect timing of events,
                    it might appear that more than mere serendipity was at work. Everything seemed to go according to
                    schedule for the Indianapolis Republican newspapers and for Governor Morton's reelection
                    campaign: first the accusations against the Copperheads, then the dramatic expose in the Carrington
                    report, then a more concentrated attack on the Sons of Liberty as dangerous subversives, and finally
                    the supposed proof of sedition in the Dodd break-in and seizure. The only missing piece was the
                    arrest, exposure, and trial of the Indiana Copperhead culprits themselves. That followed shortly.</p>
            <p>Realizing that arousing fear of the Copperheads and of armed rebels operating secretly in Indiana was
                    an issue that was pushing his financial mismanagement into the background and might well clinch the
                    gubernatorial campaign in his favor, Morton must surely have been eager to arrest Dodd and the other
                    leaders of the Sons of Liberty. He must, however, also have known that if they were arrested by
                    civil authorities, it could takes months before a trial date was set. He therefore hoped to have the
                    military, through General Carrington, perform the arrests and trials. As Kenneth M. Stampp points
                    out, "Carrington, however, was not ready to go that far, and he had his first serious
                    disagreement with the bolder Morton. The General denied that he had authority to make the arrests
                        <pb n="255" id="VAA4025-085-3-069"/> and doubted the legality of military trials when the
                    regular courts were open."<hi rend="sup">27</hi> Following his confrontation with
                    Carrington, Morton had Carrington replaced as commander of the Indiana District and had a
                    politically sympathetic General Alvin P. Hovey appointed on August 25.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> For
                    Morton time was of the essence, and he was more interested in making arrests and beginning a trial
                    than he was in the problem of whether the military or the civil authorities should conduct them.
                    After all, Lincoln had already set a precedent for an executive's taking matters out of
                    civil hands and placing them into his own or the military's for the purpose of expediency.
                    Of such action, the Merryman case and the arrest of Clement Vallandigham were just two examples.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While Dodd's office was entered and the arms there were seized, Dodd himself was attending
                    the Democratic convention in Chicago. When he returned to Indianapolis, he was arrested on September
                    3 by the military and placed in a military prison to await trial.<hi rend="sup">30</hi> As before,
                    the Democratic newspaper, the <hi rend="i">Sentinel,</hi> objected to the fact that Dodd's
                    constitutional rights had been violated. On September 5, two days after Dodd's arrest, the
                        <hi rend="i">Sentinel</hi> argued: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>We are not the apologist of Mr. DODD. If he has violated the laws of the land, let him be
                            arraigned, tried, and, if guilty, punished as those laws proscribe, and all good citizens
                            will say "so let it be." Indiana is not in a state of insurrection or
                            rebellion. No attempt has been made to interrupt the enforcement of the civil laws of the
                            State. Every mandate of the civil authorities has been respected and obeyed. If Mr. DODD has
                            been guilty of violating the laws of the State or the Federal government, upon sufficient
                            affidavit and warrant, he could have been arrested by a judiciary officer duly empowered.
                            What apology, then, for his arbitrary arrest by the military authorities? Is the mandate of
                            a military commandant in a State loyal to the Government to be regarded as superior and as
                            overriding its Constitution and its laws?<hi rend="sup">31</hi>
                  </p>
                    </quote> Although cogent, such an argument based on theoretical ideas of constitutional rights had
                    little effect especially when the Republican papers appealed directly to the fears of their
                    readership. While the <hi rend="i">Sentinel</hi> spoke in generalities, the Republican papers
                    directed their fury toward Dodd and other named parties and directed their praise toward Morton.
                    Furthermore, just at this juncture, on August 28, Morton's brother-in-law and secretary,
                    William R. Holloway, took over the editorship of the Indianapolis <hi rend="i">Daily

                    <pb n="256" id="VAA4025-085-3-070"/> That meant that the attack on Dodd and his fellow Copperheads
                    as well as praise of Morton as the man who stood against them would continue to be placed before
                    Hoosier readers on a daily basis.</p>
            <p>The trial of Dodd began on September 22, less than three weeks before the gubernatorial election on
                    October 11. The central importance of the trial to the forthcoming election of a governor in October
                    as well of a president in November is made unmistakably clear in a front page article of the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> on September 14, one week before the Dodd trial. The article, entitled
                    "The Great Criminal Case," was an account of a mock trial of "The People
                    of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

                    of the Ballot-box—October and November terms, 1864."<hi rend="sup">33</hi> Not
                    only did the article imply that the <hi rend="i">Journal's</hi> readers will vote because
                    of their angry feelings toward the criminal Copperheads but, in calling the Copperheads
                    "The Copperhead Democracy," the voters would see that the Copperheads and the
                    Democrats are one and the same. The proceedings of the Dodd trial itself were timed well for the
                    election, and it seems no accident that the publication of those proceedings began in the Republican
                        <hi rend="i">Gazette</hi> on October 4, one week before the election.</p>
            <p>Adding fuel to an already hot fire, General Hovey arrested the other chief Sons of Liberty
                    figures—Milligan, Horsey, Bowles, Heffren, and Humphreys. Importantly, on October 5
                    arrested as well was Bingham, the editor of the <hi rend="i">Sentinel.</hi> Although Bingham was
                    later exculpated, his arrest essentially quashed the one opposition newspaper and its objections to
                    the proceedings against the Sons of Liberty and quashed as well the force of the <hi rend="i">Sentinel's</hi> accusations of violation of constitutional rights. With Bingham behind
                    bars, the voice of the editor of the Democratic newspaper was also silenced during the final week of
                    the election campaign. In the October 7 issue of the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> in a front page
                    article entitled "The Bingham Appeal," which justified Bingham's arrest
                    and tossed aside the questions of violations of constitutional rights, a letter "To the
                    People of Indiana" written by Bingham from his prison cell appears. In his letter Bingham,
                    concerned now about his own personal situation, earnestly continued the arguments he had made about
                    Dodd in earlier weeks about the unconstitutionality of military arrests. The <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> ironically juxtaposed to Bingham's appeal a sharply worded article about
                    Dodd's guilt followed by a sarcastic blurb that read: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>We understand that Grand Commander Dodd and Mr. Bingham, the Chairman of the Little Mackerel

                    smug blurb clearly illustrated the position of the Democratic and Republican parties shortly before
                    the state election.</p>
            <p>That same day, October 7, Dodd escaped from jail with relative ease and fled to Canada. That gave
                    Morton and the newspapers almost all they needed for victory. The October 8 issue of the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> reported the escape of Dodd exclaiming: "His flight is an
                    admission that he was unable to overthrow the evidence against him, and we are told, indeed, that he
                    had not subpoenaed a single witness. Conscious of guilt, he saw safety in flight and thus confessed
                    the crimes for which he was arraigned."<hi rend="sup">35</hi> Finally, on the day before
                    the election, the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> ran an editorial, "To the Voters of
                    Indiana," that pulled together all the elements of the Morton campaign in order to make a
                    strong final appeal to the Hoosier voters. The editorial pleaded for a Republican vote because the
                    Democrats had "Put Vallandigham in place of your President! They put Dodd in place of your
                    Governor! … You have been threatened by a home enemy as bold and wicked as that of Jeff.
                    Davis! That enemy meant civil war, to waste your homes, to rupture this Union, to bring the rebel
                    armies into Indiana."<hi rend="sup">36</hi> Two columns over, General Hovey, who probably
                    should have remained neutral during the trials, wrote his own pleas "To the People of
                    Indiana" in which he suggested that the Copperheads might try to win the election by
                    physical force at the ballot box and that he, Hovey, was determined to see that that would not
                    occur.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="i">Gazette</hi> likewise made the most of Dodd's escape with a letter
                    "To the People of Indiana" from the very man who had set all the exposure of the
                    Sons of Liberty in motion: General Carrington. In his statement Carrington spoke in the familiar
                    language of the newspapers and of Morton's speeches suggesting that the ballot box was not
                    a political contest between Republican and Democrat but a battlefield between North and South.
                    "Citizens!" he warned, "every day shows that you were on the threshold of
                    revolution! You can rebuke this treason. The traitors intended to bring war to your homes. Meet them
                    at the ballot box while Grant and Sherman meet them in the field."<hi rend="sup">37</hi>
                    Certainly, with most of their leaders behind bars, the Copperheads would hardly be a threatening
                    physical force on the day of the election. Their power was obviously almost extinct. But after all

                    when Morton won handily over McDonald on October 11. Clearly the press and its extensive and almost
                    daily coverage of the events concerning the Copperheads and the Sons of Liberty preceding the
                    gubernatorial election played an enormus role in influencing Morton's reelection.</p>
            <p>After the election the Republican newspapers continued their war of words against the Sons of Liberty
                    because the national elections were still to come a month later, and President Lincoln was running
                    for reelection. Fortunately for them, after the Dodd escape, the Republican newspapers had another
                    treason trial on which to focus. Between October 5 and 7 Milligan and the other Sons of Liberty were
                    arrested. On October 21 their trial began.</p>
            <p>In October the <hi rend="i">Gazette</hi> ran a series that appeared in occasional installments on the
                    career of General George McClellan, Lincoln's Democratic opponent. As expected, the
                    portrait of McClellan was not a flattering one. When the trials of Milligan <hi rend="i">et al.</hi>
                    got underway, coverage of the trial obscured the McClellan coverage. For the most part the
                    newspapers provided verbatim accounts of the trial but sometimes with significant omissions. In the

                    however, it is possible to consider the treason trials in another light, for those trials show how
                    the plans and schemes of a dissenting political fringe group with little power were used by the
                    press and a shrewd politician to obscure significant issues and to shape a winning election campaign
                    based on public fear; on the suggestion that an opponent condoned the activities of a potentially
                    dangerous, armed radical fringe group; and on the suggestion that those voters who did not vote
                    against the Democrats were themselves traitors. The Indiana treason trials provide more than legal
                    history. They provide an important example of the power of a partisan press to influence politics
                    and political events.</p>

            <p>Abraham Gonzàlez y Casavantes (1864-1913) was a businessman, banker, municipal
                    administrator, journalist, and mining entrepreneur in the state of Chihuahua, Mexico, from the
                    mid-1880s to the first decade of the twentieth century. During the years immediately preceding the
                    outbreak of the revolution that was headed by the wealthy Coahuilan, Francisco I. Madero, in
                    November, 1910, González was the principal revolutionary activist in his native state. He
                    recruited, among others, Doroteo Arango (alias Francisco Villa) and Pascual Orozco for the Maderista
                    movement. One had been a cattle rustler, the other a muleteer before they became revolutionary
                    military leaders. Between November, 1910, and February, 1913, Gonzaález served as
                    provisional or constitutional governor of Chihuahua and, for a few months in late 1911 and early
                    1912, as secretary of the interior <hi rend="i">(gobernación)</hi> in the cabinet of
                    President Madero. In the spring of 1912 González was driven into hiding by the rebellion
                    of Orozco, and his office was declared vacant by a hostile legislature. He was restored to his place
                    in July by a federal column under General Victoriano Huerta. In February, 1913, after the overthrow
                    and assassination of Madero by General Huerta and his associates, González, having failed
                    to evade his Huertista enemies, was forced to resign his office and to renounce his political
                    principles. He was then, apparently on the direct orders of President Huerta, taken for a train ride
                    that he did not survive.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Few of <list type="footnotes">

                    South Bend, Indiana. There he was a student of commercial subjects and philosophy. For a time in the
                    autumn of 1883, a brother, José Guadalupe, was also at Notre Dame, but he was soon
                    obliged by illness to return to Mexico.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Abraham had to terminate his studies

                    translator in the years between his South Bend days and the outbreak of the revolution. His
                    collegiate experience, his knowledge of English, and his subsequent business contacts made him an

                    in 1929 and 1930, confuses matters by recording in his otherwise well informed works about

                        Ordinance.</hi> Proceedings of a conference held at Franklin College of Indiana, July 10-11,

            <p>The six scholarly essays in this modest volume collectively discuss significant developments and
                    milestones concerning the Old Northwest from its discovery by the French through the pioneer era.
                    Delivered at Franklin College in July, 1987, as part of the observance of the bicentennial of the
                    Northwest Ordinance of 1787, these papers are generally of a high quality. They merit careful
                    reading by citizens who are interested, as every citizen should be, in why and how the Union of
                    thirteen Atlantic seaboard states became the Union of fifty states stretching across the continent
                    and beyond.</p>
            <p>The initial essay by Paul Finkelman reviews the background, adoption, and significance of the
                    Ordinance of 1787. The author views the ordinance as the result of various motives and influences
                    and considers it one of the major achievements of the Confederation Congress. Many historians will
                    doubtless agree with this assessment, but not all of them will accept Finkelman's
                    conclusion that the ordinance "never worked well as a constitution for the territories. It
                    worked far better … as a political credo for an Empire of Liberty" (p. 16).
                    Most, however, will probably concur that, despite much progress, the "Empire of
                    Liberty" has not yet been adequately realized.</p>
            <p>The remaining essays help place the Ordinance of 1787 in its historical perspective. William J.
                    Eccles adds important insights about the Anglo-French duel for empire that England won. Reginald
                    Horsman considers how the brief British interlude helped produce the American Revolution and
                    affected American policy toward the Indians. Patrick J. Furlong offers evidence to show that the
                    ordinance was defective in mandating that laws for the first stage of territorial government be
                    adopted from the codes of the original states. Andrew R. L. Cayton emphasizes the conflict of
                    personal interests and local rivalries in developing emerging political parties, especially in <placeName>

                    pioneers of the Old <pb n="266" id="VAA4025-085-3-080"/> Northwest. All who read these essays should
                    first take note of Ralph D. Gray's excellent introduction, which gives an overview of their

               <hi rend="i">A Century and Beyond: The History of Purdue University.</hi> By Robert W. Topping.
                    (West Lafayette, Ind.: Purdue University Press, 1988. Pp. xv, 418. Illustrations, appendix,
                    bibliography, index. $27.50.)</head>
            <p>Visitors to Purdue University see a workaday campus embracing massive, functional-looking buildings;
                    not a glamourous campus, but one that conveys a sense of ordered purposefulness. This visual
                    impression is an outward manifestation of the university's essence. For over one hundred
                    years a succession of strong, businesslike presidents molded Purdue into one of the
                    nation's foremost engineering and scientific institutions. This book is the story of these
                    presidential leaders, who they were and what they accomplished. It is, therefore, not so much a
                    comprehensive history of the entire university effort as it is a series of mini-biographies of
                    presidential leaders and their chief administrative assistants.</p>
            <p>Although histories by their very nature deal with beginnings, Topping gives unusual attention to the
                    historical forces that led to the creation of Indiana's land-grant college. Long sections
                    dealing with pioneer society and with Justin Morrill's struggle to get his land-grant
                    college act passed by Congress seem excessive; but once John Purdue, prosperous Hoosier farmer and
                    entrepreneur, focuses Indiana's stumbling efforts to erect an A&amp;M school by giving
                    $150,000 to the cause, things start moving. Despite John Purdue's effort to
                    direct the enterprise, the college was shaped by its presidents. From an early time they moved it
                    toward a concentration on engineering, thus provoking agriculturalists who felt their interests were
                    being slighted. In due time Purdue University would be recognized for its work in the agricultural
                    sciences, but that part of its program was always overshadowed by its striking accomplishments in
                    engineering and related disciplines. Aggressive presidents and administrators, many of them
                    engineers by training, seized every new opportunity from aeronautics to computers to keep Purdue at
                    the forefront of engineering science.</p>
            <p>The dominance of engineering and the "hard" sciences is such that readers find no
                    reference to the humanities until they have digested some three hundred pages of text. Frederick L.
                    Hovde, Arthur G. Hansen, and other more recent presidents recognized that engineers and scientists
                    needed the humanities for a well-rounded education, yet one reason Purdue made few efforts to excel

                    strong foothold in them. As in most states with two flagship universities there was rivalry, but in
                    the Hoosier state it was kept in bounds. On many occasions the two educational giants cooperated in
                    pleading their cases before the legislature.</p>
            <p>The story Topping has chosen to tell he has told well. This is not a sentimental book designed to
                    warm the hearts of old grads, but it tells an important and useful story about people and programs
                    that have had an impact on the world. In an epilogue Purdue's current president, Steven C.
                    Beering, pledges that the university will achieve ever greater distinction in the future. Thus it
                    has always been with America's great educational institutions.</p>

            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Vincennes: A Pictorial History</hi> has appeal for all members of an Indiana
                    family—from youngster to oldster. Children can look at the pictures. School-agers can get
                    easy intellectual gulps from history-filled captions. Parents can find interesting information about
                    Vincennes from past to present. Grandparents will recall similar memories of their own existence.</p>
            <p>The city of Vincennes has tremendous historical significance for the state of Indiana and its
                    citizens. Author Richard Day notes that the name "Vincennes" can be traced back to
                    France's "Forest of Vincennes" and that a migrated Bissot family named
                    its estate on the St. Lawrence River the "Seignory of Vincennes." Son Jean
                    Baptiste Bissot became the "Sieur de Vincennes," and in 1732 his son
                    François Marie Bissot established a fort, later called Post Vincennes, along the Wabash
                    River. Today Vincennes, Indiana, and France's city of Vincennes consider themselves
                    "sister cities."</p>
            <p>In 1778 a young, Virginia-born George Rogers Clark with fewer than two hundred soldiers captured
                    Kaskaskia, Cahokia, and Vincennes. Then, in 1779, Clark recaptured Vincennes from the British
                    lieutenant-governor, Henry Hamilton. In the twentieth century, through local and state efforts, a
                    handsome George Rogers Clark Memorial was built at Vincennes with federal support. Considered by
                    some the most impressive national monument west of Washington, D.C., and compared favorably with the
                    Lincoln and Jefferson memorials in the nation's capital, this Indiana shrine is now
                    operated by the <placeName>

            <pb n="269" id="VAA4025-085-3-083"/>
            <p>Day notes in his book many more places of historical interest in the Vincennes area. Three miles
                    north of Vincennes is Fort Knox II, which has been reconstructed as a free, outdoor museum by the
                    Indiana Historical Society. Grouseland, the Georgian home built by Indiana Territory's
                    Governor William Henry Harrison in 1803-1804, has been restored and opened to the public by members
                    of the Francis Vigo Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution. The two-story building that
                    housed the early Indiana territorial legislature has also been preserved and is open to sightseers.
                    Pictures of these important sites, plus many more snapshots of local places and activities, are
                    collected in Day's volume.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Vincennes: A Pictorial History</hi> also provides a valuable summary of the economic
                    history of the Vincennes community and a concise, twenty-year updating of the city's
                    general history. After 1813 Vincennes was no longer the political focus of Indiana Territory, but it
                    continued to be the commercial center for agricultural products raised throughout the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox County</region>
                    </placeName> area. After 1850 the town became a railroad center with both north-south and east-west
                    lines. By 1900 Vincennes had become a center for manufacturing industries that used local coal and
                    natural gas deposits. After 1950 the city saw a decline in manufacturing but an increase in job
                    opportunities through the development of Vincennes University and the Good Samaritan Hospital. Thus,
                    in the mid-twentieth century Vincennes was moving from an industrial to a service economy. In recent
                    decades tourism has provided a third service-oriented boost to the city's economy.</p>
            <p>Day, whose great-great-great-great-grandfather was among the local inhabitants who greeted
                    Clark's troops in 1778, has had a lifelong interest in the history of Vincennes. His almost
                    9" x 12", 200-page volume contains a variety of illustrations that highlight many
                    facets of community goings-on. Congratulations are in order for this meticulous, insightful
                    contribution to local history.</p>

                    more than twice the length of the first. The division reflects both the significance of the
                    respective eras and the availability of images. Bigham organizes each section to emphasize the
                    developmental theme. In all save the first one he groups the images under four headings:
                    riverfront/downtown, the changing cityscape, workers and the economy, and people. The pictures
                    follow a short three-to-six page essay that provides background and context.</p>
            <p>In the first section Bigham has only two headings—riverfront/downtown and
                    people—and he uses as many prints as photographs to present his story. The remaining
                    sections are comprised primarily of photographs from a variety of sources, including a few images
                    made by Lewis Hine. The images are well reproduced, making the book attractive to read.</p>
            <p>Bigham does not, however, achieve his goal. Part of the reason for this lack of success rests with
                    the nature of historic photographs, which rarely show unguarded moments but are more often posed
                    portraits that do not convey a sense of the texture or social <pb n="271" id="VAA4025-085-3-085"/>
                    fabric of the past. Images of Evansville's physical landscape taken at different times are
                    rarely exact duplicates, for example, and at times they portray human activities that distract from
                    the theme of development. The images of workers and the economy and people often consist of group
                    portraits in front of shops, businesses, factories, churches, and schools or at baseball parks. Such
                    illustrations fail to discriminate in the way that Bigham intended and fail to sustain the theme
                    that he imposes; nevertheless, <hi rend="i">An Evansville Album</hi> is an interesting collection of

                    Indianapolis automobile manufacturers led by Carl Fisher met to make plans for a privately financed
                    highway from New York to San Francisco. Fisher, whose Indianapolis racetrack was becoming a big

                    would help attract attention to the automobile as a vehicle of long-distance travel.</p>
            <p>Working from Fisher's dream and his early leadership, the Lincoln Highway Association began
                    fund raising for mapping and construction. Although this private group succeeded in having a few
                    short "seedling mile" segments of the route paved with concrete, it was not until
                    after World War I with the help of federal financing that the highway was fully developed.
                    Two-thirds of the 3,000-mile road followed a route that was later designated US. 30.</p>
            <p>Hokanson provides details of the joys and frustrations of automobile travel during the years that the
                    Lincoln Highway was being developed. His account of Emily Post's 1915 journey in a
                    hand-built English touring car from New York to the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San
                    Francisco is a case in point. Very little of the route was paved in 1915, and Post's trip,

                    the road to dry to a passable condition.</p>
            <p>Gradually the Lincoln Highway was improved and attracted more traffic; service businesses such as
                    tourist courts, gasoline stations, and cafes opened for the motorists. As Hokanson traveled some
                    twenty thousand miles on the road, he took special interest in these artifacts of the
                    highway's heyday. He seemed, in fact, to take great delight in locating surviving Lincoln
                    Highway markers from the three thousand that had been placed about every mile along the route in
                    1918 to direct the motorists across the country. Hokanson collected excellent historical photographs
                    of life along the road, but his fine documentary photographs of the route today are the
                    book's visual treat.</p>
            <p>The modern interstate system has replaced the Lincoln Highway for most travelers, but many feel that
                    these fast, limited-access routes homogenize the landscape and that the traveler today <pb n="273" id="VAA4025-085-3-087"/> may miss much of the country's flavor. Hokanson's
                    words and pictures give strong evidence that driving across country may still be a pleasurable

            <p>In a visually conscious age illustrated histories with original and thought-provoking commentary can
                    be an effective way to link people with the past. Jack Gieck uses the medium of an illustrated
                    history to commemorate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the founding of the Canal Society of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. The pictures are annotated and accompanied by a narrative explaining the various
                    stages of the construction and operation of canals in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. The presentation is at its best when the pictures are allowed to tell their own story
                    and when the commentary is limited to annotation.</p>
            <p>From the illustrations of the primitive tools, massive superstructures, and workers at the sites one
                    gets some idea of the back-breaking manual labor and technical skill required to build a canal. From
                    the illustrations of canals bounded by wharfs and warehouse—which touch an
                    environmentalist nerve—one catches a glimpse of the economic usefulness of these
                    waterways during their heyday. And from the illustrations of sturdy women and phlegmatic-looking old
                    men posing on the decks of their canal-borne homes, one almost experiences nostalgia for a bygone
                    era when life looked so restful and uncomplicated.</p>

            <p>Scholarly interest in the antebellum Midwest has been flourishing in recent years, and Kenneth J.
                    Winkle's study of migration and political development in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> is a welcome addition to a growing <pb n="274" id="VAA4025-085-3-088"/> collection of
                    monographs in this area. Although based on a case study from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, this provocative book is much more than a parochial view of one state or region.
                    Migration was probably the single most important factor influencing the nation's social and
                    political development during the nineteenth century, and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, which lay astride a great east-west human conduit, remained at the center of this
                    great movement.</p>
            <p>The discovery that Americans moved a great deal during the decades prior to the Civil War is not new,
                    but Winkle's ingenious use of sources allows him to refine this general picture
                    considerably. Using <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> quadrennial census reports and county poll books, Winkle argues that persistence in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> between 1850 and 1860 was much lower than previously assumed. Winkle's
                    evidence is based primarily on data from a single predominantly rural county, but if this pattern
                    was in fact typical, then it makes even more compelling the question of how communities that were
                    experiencing such great mobility created political stability and order.</p>
            <p>Prior to 1841 <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> townships acted as "consensual communities" that controlled access to
                    the franchise. State registration laws, for example, gave townships effective power to prevent
                    recent immigrants from voting and otherwise to determine participation in elections. Political
                    stability resulted from excluding transients and newcomers until they had proven their stake in the
                    community. When local autonomy was undermined by an 1841 election law that established nine
                    objective criteria for registering voters, highly mobile individuals could decide for themselves,
                    within the limits of the law, their legal political residence. As the former basis of stability and
                    continuity was destroyed, political parties were forced to compete with each other more aggressively
                    for the allegiance of new voters. Political alignments, nevertheless, remained surprisingly stable
                    from election to election.</p>
            <p>Winkle's explanations of how political continuity was maintained under the new law are less
                    satisfying than other parts of his study and are not remarkably new. Like many others he argues that
                    those least likely to move—wealthy professionals and merchants—formed an elite
                    core of elected leaders who provided a basis for continuity in each community. These local leaders
                    further enhanced stability by attracting and organizing into political parties voters from among the
                    more mobile portion of the population. As a result, parties became increasingly inclusive in order
                    to absorb migrant voters.</p>
            <p>Although Winkle does not state it so boldly, the logical conclusion to his study is that large-scale
                    migration hastened the liberalization of American politics. No longer could consensual communities
                    maintain order, unity, and continuity by controlling the privileges of political participation.
                    Mobility forced communities <pb n="275" id="VAA4025-085-3-089"/> to recognize the political rights
                    of rootless individuals who had only tenuous connections with a particular place.</p>

            <p>Richard H. Sewell, biographer of the Free Soiler-Radical Republican John P. Hale and author <hi rend="i">of Ballots for Freedom: Antislavery Politics in the <placeName>
                            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                        </placeName>, 1837-1860</hi> (1976), moves in this book from political historical specialist to
                    synthesist. He has made the transition with spectacular success. In refocusing "attention
                    on slavery as the taproot of sectional discord and civil war," Sewell offers a
                    "modest challenge to those historians who see slavery as a largely artificial or symbolic
                    issue and who emphasize instead the role of such ‘ethnocultural’ concerns as
                    temperance and nativism in shaping public events …" (p. xi). Happily, the
                    challenge is very modest, never disputatious, and indeed hardly discernible. He avoids the error
                    that is too prevalent among Civil War historians of reading back into the minds of past generations
                    the knowledge and values of the late twentieth century. He brings to his work the sagacity of the
                    late David Potter and the provocative insights of Bertram Wyatt-Brown.</p>
            <p>In contrast with some historical interpretations, Sewell's argument is that a kind of
                    southern nationalism did exist prior to the Civil War, a nationalism that derived "more
                    from shared fears and resentments than from a common, unique cultural identity. … rightly
                    or wrongly, many southerners had come to believe that theirs was a distinctive way of life"
                    (p. 79). Also relevant was a mid-nineteenth century concept of "honor" that is
                    foreign to the late twentieth century American mind. It follows that southern secession, no matter
                    how ill-advised scholars now know it to have been, was the expected rather than the unexpected
                    southern reaction to Abraham Lincoln's election, for the Republican victory in 1860,
                    following a decade of sectional controversy, "represented an assault on the honor and
                    well-being of the South" (p. 78). Thus, while the words "tragic" and
                    "tragedy" hardly ever appear in his book, Sewell is sensitive to the pervasive
                    tragic theme in the history of the Civil War era.</p>
            <p>A chapter entitled "The War at Home" is a masterly account of the impact of war on
                    civilians of all classes and stations, North and South. In a chapter called "The
                    Destruction of Slavery" Sewell recounts how emancipation began early in the war, escalated
                    gradually <pb n="276" id="VAA4025-085-3-090"/> to 1865, and culminated in the establishment of the
                    Freed-men's Bureau and the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment. Paralleling wartime
                    emancipation was wartime reconstruction, which began at least as early as 1863 and probably earlier.</p>
            <p>The book is free of serious flaws. Although Lincoln and Stephen A. Douglas are given prominent roles
                    in the political history of the 1850s, there is no narrative or analysis, per se, of the
                    Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858. Sewell's account of the former slave as soldier, pupil,
                    and wage earner may be somewhat roseate, but the general excellence of the book overshadows these
                    problems. Sewell's prose is always lucid and sometimes sparkling. His knowledge of the
                    primary and secondary sources enables him to illustrate the narrative with apt quotations and lends
                    to the book an aura of authenticity. This sophisticated, but never recondite, book will be widely
                    read and enjoyed. If there is a better book of its genre on the period 1845-1865, this reviewer does
                    not know what it is.</p>

            <p>William L. Burton's <hi rend="i">Melting Pot Soldiers</hi> is a far more ambitious book than
                    its title suggests. In addition to dealing with the formation, problems, and performance of
                    immigrant units from Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, Missouri, New York, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, the author places their story in a wider context of
                    comparative ethnic history. Despite his choice of subject, however, Burton surprisingly downplays
                    ethnic conflict and even argues that nativism was not a particularly powerful force in American
                    politics by the eve of the Civil War. Indeed he is so successful in showing how ethnic regiments
                    were similar in both attitudes and behavior to other Civil War regiments that some readers may
                    finish the book wondering if there is any justification for studying ethnic regiments in their own
                    right. If these generalizations were not controversial enough, Burton also sharply criticizes the
                    filiopietism of older works in ethnic history and scathingly indicts those historians who have
                    celebrated the "contributions" of various ethnic groups without subjecting them to
                    the same kind of critical analysis that is routinely applied to the native born.</p>
            <p>In fact, some of the best chapters in the book deal with the often shady politics of recruiting
                    ethnic regiments. Burton neatly describes the labyrinthine maneuvering involved in the selection <pb n="277" id="VAA4025-085-3-091"/> of colonels and other junior officers. His argument that this
                    process simply marked a continuation of prewar ethnic politics is an especially useful one. At the
                    same time Burton gives careful attention to the various experiences of ethnic regiments both in camp
                    and in battle but avoids turning the leaders of these units into either heroes or villains. The
                    complex interplay of patriotism and opportunism in the ethnic regiments in many ways reflected the
                    larger, unresolved ambiguities of a polyglot culture. With a keen eye for social context Burton
                    observes that there was often more tension between competing ethnic groups than between the foreign
                    born and natives; therefore, any attempt to describe a simple power struggle between a bigoted
                    Anglo-Saxon establishment and their Irish and German neighbors inevitably ignores much contrary
                    evidence.</p>
            <p>Despite the author's overall success and useful interpretations, the book does have
                    shortcomings. At the beginning there is much confusing detail with seemingly little purpose, and
                    organizational problems crop up throughout the work. In the long chapters on the German and Irish
                    regiments the author plods along from state to state and regiment to regiment, an approach that
                    often obscures his analytical purpose. More generally, he should have taken much more care on the
                    transitions between chapters, sections, and paragraphs. On balance, however, the strong points
                    outweigh the weak ones; and even though many historians will accuse Burton of painting a far too
                    rosy picture of the nineteenth century American social order, they will have to reckon with this
                    sometimes original, often persuasive, and always provocative treatment of a neglected topic.</p>

            <p>Before sound bites there were political campaign buttons; before thirty-second spots, lusterware
                    teapots. Campaign objects designed to influence voters appeared during the 1828 contest between
                    incumbent John Quincy Adams and General Andrew Jackson. Then, in 1840, Whig managers used imagery to
                    transform the aristocratic General William Henry Harrison into an icon of rusticity. Images of log
                    cabins and cider barrels decorated pitchers, plates, and bandannas. In one 1840 Whig depiction
                    "Wm. H. Harrison, The <placeName>

                    hospitable barrel. It was masterfully misrepresentative
                    "hum-buggery"—in Jackson's word—but it transformed
                    American politics. Henceforth, technology would produce easy-to-grasp icons and images, artifacts
                    rather than ideas.</p>
            <figure/>
            <p>Roger A. Fischer's <hi rend="i">Tippecanoe and Trinkets Too</hi> describes this
                    "Material Culture of American Presidential Campaigns, 1828-1984." In his preface
                    the author accuses historians of "tunnel vision." They should use
                    "presidential campaign material culture … to reflect in their research
                    … the true multifaceted complexity" of political campaigns in the way that
                    archaeologists have "reconstructed whole civilizations." <hi rend="i">Tippecanoe
                        and Trinkets Too</hi> seeks to bridge "two disparate groups: the curators,
                    antiquarians, and collectors … and the academic historians …" (p.
                    vii). The book outlines some electoral history for the former and describes trinkets for the latter.</p>
            <p>The book has some difficulties. The outline unfortunately jumps from one election to the next without
                    analyses of issues, events, and trends that would help to explain these quadrennial contests.
                    Descriptions of trinkets summarize trinket catalogs and compound slogans into quotation-filled
                    paragraphs. Further, one might doubt if material culture can enlighten the "true
                    multifaceted complexity" of American politics. The author concludes that "it
                    cannot be stated with any degree of certainty that the outcome of any American presidential election
                    has been determined by its material culture" (p. 303). Objects defined Harrison in 1840 and
                    Abraham Lincoln in 1860 and may have maintained electoral enthusiasm in pivotal northern states
                    during the latter nineteenth century, but the book does not then define how political historians can
                    use this material. Political objects in this book merely restate adequately known campaign slogans.
                    An artifact's "message" depends upon who produced it—national
                    campaign leaders, <pb n="279" id="VAA4025-085-3-093"/> state and local campaigns, commercial
                    vendors. Asserting without explanation that "the 1920-48 period was a rather lean one for
                    political textiles" (p. 191) leads historians nowhere.</p>
            <p>Still, persons fond of elections will enjoy the book. For collectors the most interesting year may
                    well be 1908, when postcards, celluloid buttons (patented in 1896), pins, trays, umbrellas, and
                    endless bric-a-brac were artfully arrayed with names, pictures, and slogans. For historians the most
                    bizarre artifact to contemplate may be an 1896 William McKinley campaign soap doll placed in a
                    coffin-like box. For material specialists the most effective campaign object to analyze is, of
                    course, "I Like Ike."</p>

               <hi rend="i">The Party of Fear: From Nativist Movements to the New Right in American History.</hi>
                    By David H. Bennett. (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1988. Pp. x, 509.
                    Frontispiece, notes, index. $29.95.)</head>
            <p>This ambitious survey of nativist and counter-subversive movements from colonial times to the present
                    examines a wide array of groups ranging from the Know-Nothings to the Moral Majority. Building on
                    foundations laid by such pioneers in the field as Ray Allen Billington and John Higham, David H.
                    Bennett echoes recent scholarship in maintaining that the "antialiens" should not
                    be dismissed as irrational bigots. They had genuine concerns, the author contends, and deserve
                    "dispassionate attention" since they "have reflected tensions endemic
                    … in the very structure of American life" (p. 6). They included frauds and
                    opportunists, their actions were often reprehensible, and their movements, seeking scapegoats,
                    generally obscured the impersonal social and economic forces largely responsible for their dilemma.
                    Still, most sincerely viewed America as a threatened Eden needing protection from intruders and
                    alien ideas.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">The Party of Fear</hi> rests on impressive research, and its main thesis is persuasive.
                    The identification of nativism with the political right, however, diminishes the complexity of a
                    cause that found some support, as Bennett himself acknowledges, from other sources, including
                    abolitionists, labor leaders, and progressive reformers. Similarly, the author might have noted that
                    fear of a polluted Eden was not limited to antialiens.</p>
            <p>A detailed examination of the historical context in which the antialien movement developed adds to
                    the book's strength. Particularly fascinating is the account of the upheaval created by the
                    influx of Germans and Irish before the Civil War. At times Bennett rehashes familiar details, as in
                    his discussion of Joseph McCarthy. <pb n="280" id="VAA4025-085-3-094"/> Plodding state by state
                    analyses of larger nativist movements impede the book's general flow, but the several pages
                    Bennett devotes to the Know-Nothings and Klan in Indiana furnish serviceable introductions, if no
                    fresh insights, to the subjects. Bennett's endnotes will direct the uninitiated to basic
                    primary and secondary sources.</p>
            <p>After restrictions were placed on immigration during the 1920s, Bennett writes, alien ideas,
                    particularly communism, came increasingly to displace immigrants as the prime obsession of the
                    antialiens. He depicts Father Coughlin's movement as "an inverted
                    nativism" that provided Catholics and ethnic followers "a way of striking back at
                    ancient oppressors" (p. 509). McCarthy, another Catholic, singled out the establishment,
                    not aliens, as his target. Bennett maintains that even anti-communism has now lost most of its
                    appeal and that nativism itself has all but disappeared in contemporary society despite the
                    continuation of miniscule, if violent, groups like the Order.</p>
            <p>True, today there is no movement on the scale of the Klan of the 1920s. Yet Bennett's claim
                    that the current agitation over illegal aliens and bilingualism is largely divorced from nativist
                    sentiment is debatable, and he gives little attention to the harsh reception received by recent
                    arrivals from Asia and Latin America. Nonetheless, <hi rend="i">The Party of Fear</hi> provides a
                    valuable framework for understanding a phenomenon central to the American experience, even if it may
                    be premature to administer last rites.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Farm Families &amp; Change in Twentieth-Century America.</hi> By Mark
                    Friedberger. (Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 1988. Pp. x, 282. Tables, note on sources and
                    methods, notes, index. $28.00.)</head>
            <p>Mark Friedberger's <hi rend="i">Farm Families &amp; Change in Twentieth-Century
                    America</hi> is mainly about how farm families have coped with the rapid and dramatic changes in the
                    agricultural business during this century. Concentrating on California's Central Valley and
                    northeastern Iowa, Friedberger argues that American agriculture has remained basically family
                    oriented. He chooses examples from each area to illustrate the strategies that families pursued to
                    acquire land, expand, innovate, and survive from generation to generation. Friedberger's
                    book will reassure those who see the cherished family farm melting away. His wishful conclusion that
                    the recent agricultural crisis may actually strengthen that entity will hearten those who foresee
                    Beatrice and Tenneco farming the whole country.</p>
            <pb n="281" id="VAA4025-085-3-095"/>
            <p>Friedberger's focus on the familial nature of American agriculture is apt, but his evidence
                    is not always compelling. Readers will wonder, for example, about the typicality of his case studies
                    and about distinctions that sometimes fail to show differences. Readers might also question the
                    appropriateness of labeling massive, highly capitalized Central Valley operations "family
                    farms" just because family corporations own them.</p>
            <p>Friedberger's most serious shortcoming, however, lies not in his primary thrust but in his
                    unwillingness to press it clearly or rigorously enough. In the process of supporting his thesis he
                    strays into discussions of crop production methods, the agricultural ladder, the legal ramifications
                    of and the variant psychological reactions to the farm crisis, and other topics. All of these
                    subjects are tangentially related to his major purpose, but his discursions give the book an
                    unarticulated quality. The book is also flawed by dubious reasoning and questionable conclusions.
                    Friedberger contends, for example, that Portuguese farmers in the Central Valley
                    "never" had "confrontations over farm labor" because they relied
                    on family labor (p. 58), and he argues that Auburn, Iowa, suffered no German-baiting during World
                    War I because surrounding communities admired the local priest. At other times Friedberger displays
                    a firm grasp of the obvious, as when he assures readers that landlords "sought to rent
                    their land to competent tenants" (p. 52).</p>
            <p>All of these problems are unfortunate because they detract from a tale worth telling. Friedberger
                    knows a great deal about farm families, and he does a nice job of identifying those
                    traits—-e.g., fiscal conservatism, diversification of production, family solidarity,
                    prudent innovation, and hard work—that have helped them survive. It is unfortunate that
                    the reader has to pick through so much chaff to find the kernels.</p>

            <p>Hunger is the most important motivational force among humans, and it is the oldest enemy of mankind.
                    Crop failure, war, and rapid population growth are fundamental causes of hunger, while civil
                    disorder, disease, and death are its consequences. Increased agricultural production, domestic and
                    foreign food aid, expanded trade, migration, and family planning help alleviate or prevent hunger
                    and the threat of famine.</p>
            <p>Don Paarlberg, former distinguished professor at Purdue University and longtime public servant, has
                    surveyed the work of more <pb n="282" id="VAA4025-085-3-096"/> than two dozen men and women who have
                    made major contributions to agricultural science, food aid, and family planning at home and abroad
                    during the past two centuries. He also notes the significance of antibiotics and chemical and
                    biological pest controls and the influence of the land-grant college, experiment station, and
                    cooperative extension systems. Only in the broadest sense, however, can one directly relate this
                    study to the fight against hunger. While Norman Borlaug certainly merits recognition for helping
                    improve the food supply in Third World countries, John McCormick primarily sought personal economic
                    gain and technological achievement, the latter of which incidentally helped increase agricultural
                    production. Paarlberg also generalizes too much when he contends that hunger has been driven from
                    the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>; nevertheless, he correctly maintains that the world is better fed than ever before and
                    that a Malthusian disaster does not loom on the horizon. Still, he recognizes that much work needs
                    to be done before hunger will be eliminated on a worldwide basis.</p>
            <p>Paarlberg has written a collection of vignettes that will provide an introduction for students and
                    general readers who want to learn more about important individual contributions to agricultural
                    science, food aid, and family planning. Although he is perceptive, Paarlberg is not always a
                    critical judge of the past; nevertheless, he has provided a clearly written survey of the major
                    individual, institutional, and national efforts that have directly or indirectly helped combat the
                    age-old problems of hunger and famine.</p>

                    L. Bailey. (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1988. Pp. x, 181. Illustrations, notes,
                    index. $18.95.)</head>
            <p>Given its rather provocative title, a casual reader might well expect <hi rend="i">From Front Porch
                        to Back Seat</hi> to be a somewhat racy volume—something along the lines of <hi rend="i">National Enquirer</hi> with a little Hugh Hefner thrown in. But historian Beth L.
                    Bailey has written a serious book on a topic of growing fascination to social historians. In a very
                    brief space—fewer than 150 pages of text—Bailey seeks to analyze the
                    fundamental courtship rituals and conventions of young, white, middle-class Americans from 1920 to
                    1965. Using popular magazines, advice and etiquette books, college newspapers, and texts and journal
                    articles from marriage courses in schools, the author contends that in this period courtship moved
                    from "the controlling contexts of home and community" and "became more
                    and <pb n="283" id="VAA4025-085-3-097"/> more a private act conducted in the public world"
                    (p. 3). At the same time young men and women increasingly rejected the concept of "playing
                    the field" for a rather intense need to "go steady."</p>
            <p>A brief review cannot do full justice to this complex and densely packed work. Bailey is especially
                    effective and provocative in building her central model: that dating conventions were deeply tied to
                    an essentially commercial relationship. One of the author's favorite words is
                    "commodification," as she argues that the whole concept of dating as it evolved in
                    the twentieth century in essence allowed men to "purchase" women by asking for
                    dates and paying for the experience. Indeed, the quite non-economic word "love"
                    seldom appears in this study. As Bailey puts it, "love was not so much the province of
                    convention. … I will leave love to lovers in private and examine the public conventions
                    of desire" (p. 12).</p>
            <p>This fine study expands beautifully on the work of Joseph F. Kett and Paula S. Fass, but it is not
                    without flaws. Bailey tends to overwork the new jargon; words like "privilege"
                    used as a verb, "discourse," and "subtextually" dot the text.
                    The topical organization is sometimes confusing. And Bailey could profitably write a second book on
                    the subject—one in which she broadens her scope beyond the young, the white, and the
                    middle class. Next time she might even try to show what, if anything, love has to do with it.</p>

            <p>For Cincinnati Reds fans a new book about their favorite team is always welcome, and Robert Harris
                    Walker has written a different kind of Reds volume. Other books concentrate on the history of the
                    Reds as a baseball team; Walker places the history of the team within the context of the city of
                    Cincinnati and its geographical region, which includes the southwestern part of Indiana.</p>
            <p>Walker's book grew out of a series of interviews with players, managers, owners, and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Queen City</settlement>
                    </placeName> residents. The first chapter opens with the All-star game in 1970 when Pete Rose slid
                    into home plate to score the controversial winning run. A history of professional baseball in
                    Cincinnati follows, and a brief history of the city highlighting its German heritage gives an
                    insight into the character of the town and the region. Walker credits the building of Riverfront
                    Stadium for revitalizing Cincinnati's downtown area. Further testimony to the importance of
                    baseball to the <placeName>

            <p>Walker grew up in Cincinnati, and his early life revolved around the success or lack of success of
                    the Reds. He attended his first game at age eight and still treasures the scorecard from that
                    memorable game. "The Big Red Machine" noted in the title of his book refers, of
                    course, to the Reds teams of the 1970s. A large portion of the text and many pictures are devoted to
                    analysis of those teams. Interviews with players, coaches, and other persons who were closely
                    involved with the glory years of the Cincinnati Reds will be dear to the heart of any fan.</p>
            <p>For the baseball fan <hi rend="i">Cincinnati and the Big Red Machine</hi> gives a bit too much civic
                    history; for the historian the role of baseball in the town's history is overemphasized;
                    but for a person who is fan of both baseball and history, this book is recommended for an

                    351. Index. $29.95.)</head>
            <p>Two recent bibliographies make major contributions to research in Potawatomi history and Civil War
                    history.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Kinsmen Through Time</hi> was compiled by R. David Edmunds, generally considered the
                    leading authority on the Potawatomis and now a member of the history department at Indiana
                    University, Bloomington. The bibliography has 1,092 entries and lists books, pamphlets, articles,
                    and unpublished theses and dissertations. Following an initial section of "General
                    Studies," the work is divided into five chronological periods ranging from the early
                    contact period to the twentieth century. The preface provides a helpful overview of Potawatomi
                    history. The index does not include authors or titles, but it covers subjects very thoroughly and
                    helps in locating books that do not fall easily into the chronological framework. Edmunds guides the
                    reader to specific volumes in large sets, such as the <hi rend="i">Collections of the <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                        </placeName> State Historical Library</hi> and the <hi rend="i">Collections of the Michigan
                        Pioneer and Historical Society,</hi> which contain substantial information on the Potawatomis.
                    In addition, for those wishing to go beyond this bibliography Edmunds refers in his preface to
                    unpublished source materials. Acknowledging that any bibliography is out-of-date as soon as it is
                    published, Edmunds nevertheless states, "I am confident that this bibliography contains
                    well over 95 percent of all significant Potawatomi materials (excluding congressional documents)
                    published in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> or Canada prior to 1985" (p. xvii). There seems to be no reason to doubt his
                    statement.</p>
            <p>Garold L. Cole's bibliography of books and articles covers publications that appeared from
                    1955 through 1986, the period during which the Civil War centennial inspired renewed interest in
                    firsthand accounts of that conflict. As Cole states in his introduction, this volume is intended to
                    complement works covering earlier publications, including Charles E. Dornbusch's <hi rend="i">Military Bibliography of the Civil War</hi> (1961-1972) and James I. Robertson and Bell
                    I. Wiley's <hi rend="i">Civil War Books</hi> (1965-1967). Cole's book surpasses
                    these, however, in both its coverage and detailed annotations. The 1,395 entries are divided into
                    three categories: "The North," "The South," and
                    "Anthologies and Studies." The first two sections are subdivided into accounts by
                    members of the military, by civilians, and by travelers. The last is divided into general studies,
                    studies of the <pb n="286" id="VAA4025-085-3-100"/> North, and studies of the South. The detailed
                    index includes authors and editors of narratives, titles, state troops, names of battles, places,
                    and subjects.</p>
            <p>These volumes are annotated bibliographies in the best and fullest sense of the term. They provide
                    detailed notes in each entry, and Cole includes many quotations from the original accounts as part
                    of the annotation. Each will give the researcher an invaluable overview of the literature available
                    in its area, and each is indispensable to any student of the subject covered.</p>

                        Reference Works.</hi> By Francis Paul Prucha. (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1987. Pp.

            <p>Any reference book is outdated before it appears; publishers annually produce a vast array of guides
                    and bibliographies, which, because of the inevitable time lag between the completion of a manuscript
                    and the appearance of a published volume, cannot contain the very latest sources. Now about two
                    years out of date, Francis Paul Prucha's helpful list of reference sources is no exception;
                    that fact, however, should not seriously detract from its general usefulness as an introductory
                    guide.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Handbook for Research in American History</hi> is intended to introduce beginning,
                    established, and "non" historians "to the helps that await them in the
                    reference sections of the library" (p. 1). Although it is not heavily annotated, it can
                    serve to orient a beginning researcher, who may then choose to consult more complete compilations,
                    most notably the tenth edition of Eugene P. Sheehy's <hi rend="i">Guide to Reference
                    Books</hi> (1986), to which the present volume owes a great debt. The <hi rend="i">Handbook</hi>
                    will be less useful to seasoned researchers.</p>
            <p>Divided into two sections, part one of Prucha's <hi rend="i">Handbook</hi> is arranged into
                    seventeen chapters by type of reference source (general bibliographies, guides to periodical
                    literature, manuscript guides, lists of dissertations and theses, etc.). Part two is a subject
                    arrangement covering fifteen areas from American Indians, Blacks, and Military History, to Religion,
                    Regional Material, and Travel Accounts. Because Prucha chose to omit most older publications in this
                    second section, however, researchers may find it necessary to seek supplementary information in
                    other subject bibliographies.</p>
            <p>Although the <hi rend="i">Handbook</hi> will be helpful in making concise references to complete
                    citations that appear elsewhere, users of the volume may require some patience in coping with the
                    alphanumeric <pb n="287" id="VAA4025-085-3-101"/> designations used for listed titles, which
                    difficulty is especially apparent in the index, where page references, by and large, are omitted.</p>
            <p>The first part of the <hi rend="i">Handbook</hi> is probably more beneficial than the second.
                    Although the reference work cannot claim to cover any new ground, the intelligence with which Prucha
                    arranges and explains his selection of materials will assist many beginning historians. Part two is
                    less successful, but only because of its subject limitations. The selection of topics "that
                    are likely to be of interest to considerable numbers of researchers in <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> history" (p. 141) seems quite arbitrary, a fact that Prucha acknowledges.
                    Thus, more traditional subject fields, such as architecture, literature, and sociology, are omitted
                    in lieu of those in more current favor, and this section will consequently be useful only if one
                    happens to be researching one of the subjects considered. Because the <hi rend="i">Handbook</hi> is
                    selective, not exhaustive, many sources are naturally omitted from both sections; but sound reasons
                    could no doubt be given for such exclusions, and the author never claims comprehensiveness.</p>
            <p>The impetus behind <hi rend="i">Handbook for Research in American History</hi> is well founded, and
                    researchers in Indiana history will find numerous citations to pertinent reference sources in
                    virtually every section. The book should not replace library orientation courses, which are offered
                    at many colleges and universities, and cannot replace more massive compilations, such as
                    Sheehy's <hi rend="i">Guide,</hi> already noted. As a book to convey information about
                    selected reference sources in American history, however, it will serve its audience well and perhaps
                    will whet the appetite of the newly initiated to delve even more deeply into the labyrinthian world
                    of reference and bibliography.</p>

            <p>Professional and avocational archaeologists alike will welcome Noel D. Justice's synthesis
                    of types of projectile points for the mid-continental and eastern <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. No one has heretofore attempted a study covering such a large area, although there are
                        <pb n="288" id="VAA4025-085-3-102"/> several works on subregions of the East. Justice's
                    well-researched volume organizes typological data from the best archaeological contexts from the
                    eastern <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> according to increasingly accepted "type clusters." This is a very
                    rational organizational method given the amount of variability that is evident from statistical
                    analyses of haft morphology at several stratified sites in the region covered by the study. Much of
                    Justice's characterization of the early time periods is sound, and his inclusion of a
                    number of illustrated points from excavations directed by Jefferson Chapman in Tellico Reservoir is
                    significant. These stratigraphic deposits, along with those at Koster, St. Albans, Doerschuk,
                    Pigeon's Roost, and other lesser known sites, have altered expectations about typological
                    homogeneity in the Archaic because the earliest deeply stratified contexts were rockshelters
                    (Russell Cave, Stanfield-Worley, Modoc, and Graham Cave), shallow upland contexts (Hardaway, Dalton,
                    and Quad), or shell middens (Eva and Indian Knoll). In these contexts individual occupations are
                    barely separated by depositional events; thus, it is not surprising to find more morphological
                    variability (as measured by the number of point types per stratum) than in contexts such as Rose
                    Island, Icehouse Bottom, Doerschuk, St. Albans, and Koster.</p>
            <p>The book's eight color plates illustrate the various levels of skill and the range of flint
                    and chert utilized by the native inhabitants of the Midcontinent and Indiana in particular. Justice
                    presents descriptions of manufacture technique, resultant morphology, age, and cultural affiliation
                    and very useful distributional maps for a total of 121 types grouped into 50 type clusters. The
                    quality of information so presented is consistent throughout and will be particularly helpful to
                    contract archaeologists who find themselves working in unfamiliar parts of the country.</p>
            <p>This self-proclaimed manual is a very satisfactory compilation of extant knowledge of projectile
                    point classifications. The book's only weakness in this regard is the differential number
                    of point types utilized for the Archaic and Woodland traditions as compared to the Mississippian.
                    This differential is at once evidence of the variable effort placed upon this particular functional
                    class of stone tools by hunter-gatherer specialists and perhaps of the variability that did, in
                    fact, exist in dart versus arrow weapon systems. At any rate, anyone wishing to pursue these
                    questions will be well armed with this manual.</p>
