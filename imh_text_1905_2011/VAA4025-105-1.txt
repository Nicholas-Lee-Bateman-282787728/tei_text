                The Hoosier Cabinet and the American Housewife
                NANCY HILLER
                In the distaste - ranging from mild ennui to marriage-wrecking exasperation -
                    that late nineteenth-century women shared for household work, a few
                    entrepreneurial men in 
                        Albany
                    , 
                        Indiana
                    , saw a golden opportunity. The farm equipment factory these
                    businessmen had founded was surviving but far from thriving when they happened
                    on a product that would catapult their firm to national fame. The Hoosier
                    cabinet, a freestanding cupboard equipped with ingenious mechanical devices,
                    consolidated storage and maximized the efficiency of kitchen labor, thereby
                    alleviating some of the most exasperating aspects of the middle-class
                    housewife's daily responsibilities. This article examines how a modest
                    item of 
                        Indiana
                    -made furniture came to alter the course of kitchen history.
                Women's lives during the late 1800s were quite different from our own.
                    For working-class and rural women, general housekeeping involved real physical
                    labor. Most tasks had to be done by hand-churning butter, stoking stoves with
                    wood or coal carried from the porch or cellar, chopping and mixing and washing.
                    Kitchens were sparsely furnished, usually with a worktable and sink, a storage
                    cupboard, and a few open shelves; dry goods purchased from the grocer were kept
                    in a pantry, along with rows of the canned goods that most women made from
                    homegrown produce. Kitchens were also typically large; a basic work area of 14
                    by 18 feet was not unusual,

                    with many tasks performed in ancillary rooms
                    such as a cellar or pantry, in addition to an outdoor yard. An average housewife
                    walked thousands of steps each day in the course of food preparation and cleanup
                    alone.
                Even middle-class women who could afford paid help found everyday life to be far
                    from easy. Servants often brought trouble into their mistresses' homes
                    - communication problems, personality conflicts, and differences in domestic
                    habits - and domestic help, good or bad, was becoming increasingly hard to find.
                    The factories of the rapidly growing manufacturing sector were hungry for labor,
                    and, despite poor pay and significant hardships, employment in book binderies,
                    paper mills, and button shops often proved more appealing than domestic service,
                    with its preponderance of fickle and unreasonably demanding employers.1 The problem, from the workers' perspective, was
                    summed up nicely by a woman who contrasted her servant friends'
                    existence with her own experience in industry: "[T]hey're
                    never sure of one minute that's their own when they're in the
                    [mistresses'] house .... Our day [in the factory]," she
                    continued, "is ten hours long, but when it's done
                    it's done, and we can do what we like with the evenings."2
                As domestic servants exchanged their harried positions for the structure and
                    independence of industrial work, their former mistresses were forced back into
                    their own kitchens, where they found themselves at a loss. After years -
                    sometimes generations - of depending on hired labor to deal with the innumerable
                    basic tasks of everyday life, many lacked the expertise required to provide for
                    their families.3 What was a young housewife to make of a
                    recipe that told her to take "a pinch of this, and a little of that,
                    and considerable of the other, and cook them till they are done about
                    right"? The literature of the period suggests that overcooked dinners,
                    sagging cakes, and other minor disasters led frequently to household strife, but
                    there was little formal instruction available in how to remedy such problems.
                    Moreover, despite the considerable skill, creativity, and effort involved in
                    kitchen-related enterprises, many middle-class Americans held such work in low
                    regard, a fact that did nothing to fuel the housewife's motivation.4

                Catharine Beecher, one of the century's most influential writers and
                    activists, sought to address this disparity at both its individual and its
                    broader social levels. With her equally well-known sister Harriet Beecher Stowe,
                    she published and lectured on the need for formal instruction in the house -
                    keeping arts, arguing that proficient, wholesome housekeeping would have
                    wide-reaching effects on American society as a whole. Beyond providing practical
                    guidance that ranged from recipes for calf's foot blancmange and egg
                    frizzle to her impressively detailed design for a kitchen work cupboard that she
                    called a "cooking form," Beecher published an astonishing
                    variety of insights into the all-too-often stifling effects of domestic life on
                    the American woman's spirit.5
                As Barbara Welter and others have convincingly argued, women's attempts
                    to live up to nineteenth-century ideals of womanhood bred resentment. Day after
                    day spent alone at home in housework that was not just exhausting, but accorded
                    little-if any-respect, left wives with what we would call low self-esteem, not
                    to mention a lack of energy and enthusiasm for family activities by the end of
                    the day.6 Understanding that women needed to feel as though
                    their contributions were valued both by their husbands and family at home and in
                    the wider socio-political sphere, Beecher argued that housekeeping, no less than
                    other forms of business, should be formally taught, and that it warranted the
                    cachet of domestic science. While she supported home beautification and other
                    pursuits on the grounds that these would promote the happy temperament so
                    encouraging to godly living, she cautioned against overspending on such relative
                    frivolities, as doing so could kindle domestic strife. Strife, above all, must
                    be avoided; a husband who was "wearied with endless
                    complaints" might well be drawn to clubs plying family-wrecking
                        temptations.7 Even in her most impassioned calls for
                    improvements to women's welfare, Beecher steadfastly upheld the
                    importance of maintaining household harmony, and with it, the institution of
                    marriage.
                While Beecher and other advocates of women's welfare were working for a
                    better society, economic and technological changes were paving the way for
                    industrial manufacturing on an unprecedented scale. The Hoosier cabinet itself
                    could only be produced because of radical improvements in

                    transportation of raw materials. These improvements were augmented by changes in
                    energy production and supply that gave rise to the mechanized factory, and by
                    changes in transportation that allowed for the shipment of finished products to
                    increasingly far-flung places.
                From the territory's early history, 
                        Indiana's
                     dense hardwood forests had appealed to craftsmen in wood. As early
                    as 1818, The Emigrant's Guide, or Pocket Geography of the
                        Western States and Territories advertised the 
                        Indiana
                     high country as a rich source of premium timber.8 The prospect drew established artisans from such centers of craftsmanship
                        Boston
                     and 
                        New
                            York
                    , and many brought with them their skills, equipment, and knowledge
                    of the furniture business. Joseph Meeks moved to 
                        Brookville

                        Indiana
                    , in 1818, and the following February, he placed an advertisement in
                    the Enquirer and Indiana Telegraph: JOSEPH MEEKS CABINET-MAKER,
                        Late from the

                        last eight years, takes this method of informing the inhabitants of 
                            Brookville

                        at this place. He has brought with him a quantity of Superior
                            Mahogany, which he will manufacture in the newest fashion and
                        workman like manner; likewise other woods natural to the growth of this
                        country. His residence at present is at the House of Mrs. Cooper, in the
                        rear of Mr. Ray's tavern. N.B. An Apprentice wanted immediately.9
                Furniture - and cabinetmaking enterprises flourished in 
                        Indiana
                    , though setbacks due to bankruptcy or fire were common. When
                    business was good, craftsmen had opportunities to display considerable artistry;
                    catalogs and advertisements from the early nineteenth century list such items as
                    Fancy beds, circular bureaus, scroll-top Windsor chairs, and tables with
                    elaborately reeded legs. At other times, many shops kept going by manufacturing
                    farm equipment, caskets, or basic household objects such as salt boxes and
                    quilting frames.10

                    beyond dependence on hand tools to equipment powered by horses, dogs, water, and
                    steam. 
                        The
                            state's
                     1820 industrial census recorded 28 cabinetmakers and 7 chairmakers,
                    but by 1840, furniture making had become the state's third-most-common
                    industry, its practitioners outnumbered only by those in home construction and
                    the manufacture of leather products.11 By the mid-nineteenth
                    century many shops had several employees, and mechanization had enabled some
                    establishments' production to outpace demand, resulting in inventory
                    available for sale through merchants and dealers.12 Hoosier
                    manufacturers produced a wide range of nationally sought-after furniture, from
                    rustic Old Hickory chairs and settees used in vacation lodges to perhaps the
                    most renowned product of the state's industry - the Wooton Desk,
                    patented in 1874, which became an international status symbol among businessmen,
                    politicians, and other men of wealth and power.13
                Mechanization was accompanied by a scientific attitude toward business
                    efficiency, one result of which was the time and motion study. Coinciding with
                    this trend, selling was increasingly regarded as a profession in its own right;
                    every aspect of the field was analyzed and refined, from advertising copy and
                    promotional events to the most effective ways for salesmen in retail stores to
                    stand, move, and smile while demonstrating their products. All of these
                    developments would play a role in the design, manufacture, and sales of the
                    Hoosier cabinet.
                One night, while millions of anonymous women bent over ironing boards or dropped
                    their sewing to answer the cries of screaming children, a small gathering of
                    businessmen leaned back in the creaking chairs of their office club in 
                        Albany
                    , 
                        Indiana

                    two partners, J. Maring and T. Hart, convened on a regular basis to talk about
                    commerce and to dream.
                The elder McQuinn had worked for the Buckeye Window Glass Company of

                    , following the depletion of the natural gas on which the glass
                    works in 
                        Ohio
                     had depended, McQuinn undertook some side work for the Albany State
                    Bank, keeping books and helping the management while still devoted to his
                    primary job with Buckeye Glass. This part-time work introduced him to some of 
                        Albany's
                     most influential business people. In 1899 the glass firm was sold,
                    and McQuinn's non-compete agreement obligated him to go into another
                    line of work. He wanted to remain in manufacturing but had no particular plan in
                    mind.
                In the easy company of the office club with Maring and Hart, the senior McQuinn
                    tossed around ideas for a possible venture. A local furniture factory had fallen
                    on hard times. The owners had laid off their employees and were willing to sell
                    the enterprise at a bargain price. Whatever the actual thoughts exchanged on the
                    night of this meeting, we can gain some insight into the entrepreneurial motives
                    of the participants from an account published in the New Castle
                        Times in April 1910. Some ten years or more
                        ago a little group of men bethought them that mankind is making his work
                        easy and light by the employment of all manner of machines and convenient
                        appliances to such an extent that the ancient curse about man eating bread
                        in the sweat of his brow seems to be revoked, and that all the while
                        womankind in the performance of her household work and her manifold
                        ministrations to the comforts of the home is laboring under many
                        disadvantages, is without machines and labor-saving appliances such as men
                        employ, so that the original cur[s]e hangs heavily upon her.14 However anachronistic the Times
                    account may be, attributing to the club members an awareness of their future
                    product that they almost certainly must have lacked, it shows, if nothing else,
                    the success that women had achieved - individually in their homes, as well as
                    through the advocacy of authors such as the Beecher sisters - in publicizing
                    their message about the need for better kitchens.
                The elder McQuinn acquired the old furniture factory and began operations. The
                    factory's first known product was not, in fact, the women's
                    labor saver referred to in the Times account above, but a
                    piece of agricultural equipment known as a seed separator. It seems, however,
                    that even as the company manufactured these farm implements, which they sold

                            quoted by Herbert L. Heller in "Hoosier Kitchen Cabinet Factory
                            Opens," The New Castle Courier-Times, 1980
                            (exact publication date unavailable).
                    
                     house-to-house from gaily decorated
                    horse-drawn carts, someone in the shop had started to make kitchen cabinets. We
                    have no account of exactly how these first few cabinets came to be produced.
                    Perhaps one of the owners' wives had requested a prototype that she
                    could try out in her kitchen. We do know that the company thought the cabinets
                    had potential as a secondary product to ensure regular income during winter
                    months, when equipment sales to farmers would likely be slow.
                Whatever the case, the company had a few kitchen cabinets on hand when the
                    principals realized that the seed separators were going to be a hard sell. The
                    morning after the meeting in which they had discussed the disappointing farm
                    equipment sales, they sent out each of their four wagons with a cabinet on
                    board, in addition to the regular complement of seed separators. The results
                    were stunning, as the senior McQuinn would later describe: [T]he drivers all came in and reported that they had sold
                        the kitchen cabinet to practically the first prospect, but they brought
                        nearly all of the seed separators back unsold. The second day each took two
                        cabinets and one seed separator and that night all cabinets were reported
                        easily sold. The third day each driver took three kitchen cabinets and long
                        before night they all returned entirely sold out. That settled the question
                        definitely as to what line of furniture we should make.15 The company was on its way.
                Within the first two years of operation, the Hoosier factory, like countless
                    others of the time that were housed in wooden buildings, had suffered a
                    devastating fire. But the company soon acquired new premises. The city of 
                        New
                            Castle
                    , approximately twenty-five miles south of 
                        Albany
                    , was willing to chip in $2,500 toward the purchase of manufacturing
                    space, in exchange for a contract promising to employ twenty-five men for a
                    minimum of eight months a year.16 The company moved into the
                    former Speeder Cycle Factory, which offered 18,000 square feet of space.
                The Hoosier cabinet's basic design is most often attributed to its well-
                    known immediate predecessor, the baker's table. With its rounded
                    storage bins for flour (which led to its nickname, the possum belly table), its
                    working surface for kneading or rolling out dough, and the shallow, two-door
                    upper section that was added to many models, the baker's cabinet
                    undoubtedly

                    helped shape the Hoosier genre. However, there
                    were additional influences as well.
                In basic form, the Hoosier cabinet is not radically distinct from several other
                    types of cupboard that preceded its invention. As long ago as the sixteenth
                    century, English kitchens included a piece of furniture known as a dresser, on
                    which meat would be prepared, or dressed. In addition to its work surface, the
                    dresser (which has since come to be most widely known as a Welsh dresser) had a
                    shallow upper section with open shelves for storing linens and dishes. British
                    colonists imported this type of cabinet to 
                        America
                    , where the form became refined over time to suit peculiarly
                    American needs.17 Step-back cupboards, which featured a
                    deeper base cabinet with two doors below a shallow upper section usually
                    enclosed by two glazed doors, were also widely used in kitchens of the mid- to
                    late nineteenth century.
                In 1887, more than ten years before the Hoosier Manufacturing Company was
                    founded, a certain John Roth patented a design for a cabinet with compartments
                    for dishes, pies, small pots, and other kitchen wares, in addition to a
                    dedicated space for flour, drawers for coffee, tea, and spices, and a kneading
                    board for bread. The following statement by Roth, about whose creation little
                    more is known, is especially compelling in view of the claims that would be made
                    several years later by the various manufacturers of Hoosier cabinets: My kitchen dresser is particularly adapted to the use of
                        small families and will promote comfort and convenience of such by
                        furnishing storage for the most essential articles of food and for the
                        utensils for preparing and enjoying the same and at the same time the utmost
                        economy of space is secured.18
                Another nineteenth-century development that contributed to the Hoosier
                    cabinet's distinctive design was the invention of wall-hung bins, which
                    provided sanitary storage of flour while allowing for easy and economical
                    dispensing. The bins could be purchased in different sizes and supplied with
                    their own sifters.19

                Early versions of the Hoosier cabinet had the lower section fitted with racks to
                    store dishes and a pull-out shelf for storing pots, pans, and other larger
                    items. The lower section also had a bread bin and drawers for utensils and
                    linens. On this base was mounted a counter that could be extended for a user
                    seated at a stool; the counter was built of wood with a zinc or enameled top for
                    ease of cleaning. The upper section was shallower and housed a flour dispenser,
                    usually with its own built-in sifter; hooks for hanging small utensils; racks
                    for storing spices and jars of extracts; a holder for the housewife's
                    rolling pin; space for jars of coffee, tea, and sugar; and shelves for smaller
                    dishes, glassware, and cups. Later versions became increasingly sophisticated in
                    their accoutrements and styling, eventually including meal-planning computers,
                    daily reminders for grocery trips, and helpful household hints.
                What differentiated the Hoosier cabinet most markedly from its predecessors -
                    aside from the intriguing cabinet described by Roth, above - was its
                    meticulously organized interior storage, a testament to the late
                    nineteenth-century preoccupation with functional design. The Beecher sisters had
                    advocated such attention to planning and detail for kitchen work in the middle
                    of the century, and efficiency expert Frederick Winslow Taylor had perfected its
                    applications to the work of office and factory. The Wooton desk had exemplified
                    this fascination with system and efficiency in brilliant style, and some
                    scholars have seen precedents for the Hoosier cabinet's interior
                    organization in the furniture of the late nineteenth-century office.20 Just as the Wooton businessman's desk had come
                    to symbolize its user's status, the Hoosier cabinet would transcend the
                    scope of mundane kitchen furniture, providing a material signifier of a
                    woman's culinary and other domestic skills.
                The most famous company to produce the cabinets was the Hoosier Manufacturing
                    Company. The other best-known makers were Sellers, Nappanee, McDougall, Boone,
                    and Wilson. Not all the manufacturers were in 
                        Indiana
                    . The 1907 "Directory of Leading and Representative
                    Furniture Manufacturers of the

                    became known as a generic "kitchen
                    cabinet," many manufacturers, large and small, began producing them.22
                The systematic and ergonomic design of the Hoosier cabinet genuinely expedited
                    meal preparation and consolidated kitchen storage. But mere features alone,
                    however helpful, cannot account for the millions of cabinets that would find
                    their way into American homes. To understand why the cabinets became such a
                    runaway success we have to appreciate the part played in this story by the
                    increasingly sophisticated profession of sales, which not only promoted the
                    cabinets by making them accessible to buyers, but extolled their many benefits
                    as well.
                The history of the Hoosier cabinet illustrates how early twentieth-century
                    manufacturers enthusiastically put these principles of salesmanship and
                    marketing into practice. The Hoosier Manufacturing Company, whose promotional
                    budget and visionary sales strategies vastly surpassed those of any other firm,
                    advertised in newspapers and magazines almost from its inception. By the 1920s,
                    Hoosier was spending almost a quarter-million dollars annually on advertising.
                    In an effort to capitalize on the interest generated by these advertisements,
                    the company established dealer relationships with furniture stores. However,
                    most businesses were less than enthusiastic at the prospect of devoting precious
                    floor space to mere kitchen cabinets. In 1904 the firm publicized a plan to sell
                    to customers directly, cutting out the middlemen, but they later found it most
                    expedient to establish their own network of
                    "Hoosier-authorized" dealers, and they artfully coordinated
                    their advertising in print media with promotional events at these localized
                        venues.23 By 1916 there were over 5,000 dealers, and the
                    company had sold more than a million cabinets.
                As countless advertisements for Hoosier cabinets show, the purveyors of these
                    "step savers" profited richly from the Beecher
                    sisters' insights and creativity. The promotion of "equable
                    and cheerful temper and tone in the housekeeper" proved a spectacular
                    means to increase sales. Although only a few advertisements explicitly cited the
                    Beechers (and it is Catharine whose wisdom was most often invoked), the
                    sisters' influence is unmistakable. Not only had they literally
                    provided a blueprint for the cabinet's essential design, with their
                    drawing of the cooking form; their writings had enumerated exactly those areas
                    of the middle-class housewife's daily existence that warranted
                    remediation - a list that, for these businesses, translated to unmined veins of
                    gold.

                            Indiana
                        , is one of the many firms that manufactured Hoosier-type
                        kitchen cabinets among their products. The offices of the Indiana University
                        Press have for decades been located in one of the former Showers
                        Brothers' showrooms; their adjacent factory building now houses

                Worn out? The new kitchen cabinet promised to reduce the overall amount of labor
                    the housewife had to perform, as well as make each step of that labor less
                    physically taxing. Feeling unappreciated? The investment of $50 required to
                    purchase a Hoosier cabinet would provide a concrete symbol of the esteem in
                    which a housewife's work was held by her spouse. Wondering what your
                    education was for, when you spend so much of your daily life in menial labor?
                    The cabinet's diverse, ingenious appurtenances would indicate to the
                    woman of the house and to others that the challenges of kitchen work were many
                    and real; why else would "efficiency experts" have devoted so
                    much attention to inventing such equipment? Beyond all of these remedies to
                    domestic woes there also lay a positive reason to buy this cabinet: the simple
                    beauty of the object as a piece of furniture would make the housewife's
                    time in her kitchen a rewarding pleasure. Finally, the presence of a Hoosier
                    cabinet in a woman's home would demonstrate to family and friends her
                    embrace of modern ideals.
                The various manufacturers of Hoosier cabinets employed a variety of print media
                    for advertising, from local newspapers to national magazines. Some of these
                    publications were directed at a female readership - The
                        Ladies' Home Journal, Good Housekeeping, Better Homes and Gardens, and Woman's
                        Home Companion, among them. Others, which included Liberty
                        Magazine, Everybody's Magazine, and The Saturday Evening Post, were intended for general
                    readers.
                Others still were directed specifically at husbands. In its earlier years, the
                    Hoosier Manufacturing Company advertised in farm publications such as National Stockman and Farmer Magazine and Breeder's Gazette. The male head of the household would,
                    after all, be paying for the cabinet's purchase. But the most telling
                    bit of advertising directed at men must surely be a 1913 example published in
                        Country Gentleman. Entitled "The Moving Picture
                    Story of a Hoosier Cabinet," it shows three drawings of a housewife. In
                    the first, she "sits while working," rather than having to
                    stand. The second shows how she can keep all her tools and materials at
                    arm's reach, which saves her from having to walk around the kitchen.
                    The third plate triumphantly proclaims, "Through Early - Not
                    Tired," perhaps hinting that the wife might be expected to have energy
                    left for other activities she might engage in with her husband at the end of the
                    day.
                Most of the ads, however, were directed at wives themselves, who could presumably
                    be counted on to suggest to their spouses the positive improvement in every
                    aspect of family life that this modern invention would facilitate. If
                    matter-of-fact suggestion proved unsuccessful, she might badger her husband; how
                    could anyone not afford a Hoosier, when the company offered payment on credit
                    with only a dollar down and forty-nine payments of a dollar a week? While fifty
                    dollars represented a great deal more money in 1900 than it does today, the
                    payment plan brought these cabinets within
                    the reach of countless buyers whose income would otherwise have precluded such a
                    purchase. The cabinet would be paid for in a year and provide decades of
                    stalwart service! If the cabinet's combination of practical features
                    and affordability did not sway a stubborn husband, his wife could point out, as
                    had the piece in Country Gentleman, that this purchase might
                    well garner him more wifely attention.
                Men's work, being visible in the public sphere, brought financial
                    profit, opportunities, and recognition. The Beecher sisters had understood the
                    importance of such recognition to an individual's motivation and sense
                    of self-worth. But women, who labored in the home, worked largely by themselves.
                    Their work was also taken for granted, which led to a vicious cycle: feeling
                    underappreciated contributed to low self-esteem, which in turn often led to
                    grumpiness and impatience with family. This syndrome of negativity at least made
                    many women's housekeeping labors more of a chore than they needed to
                    be, and at worst caused significant household strife. The frequency with which
                    the advertisements promised relief from drudgery and exhaustion certainly
                    suggests that in spite of the nineteenth century's vaunted ideals,
                    women's household work had taken a heavy toll on marriage and family
                    life.
                In response to such realities, some Hoosier cabinet advertisements were designed
                    to make women feel that their domestic labors were valued for their
                    contributions beyond the domestic sphere. The authors of these ads undoubtedly
                    understood that this constituted a subtle yet welcome form of flattery - a way
                    of helping women appreciate their part in the larger community. The beef and
                    mutton pie they prepared for dinner, or the calf's foot blancmange they
                    served for dessert (both are included in Miss Beecher's
                        Domestic Receipt Book) might have national or even international
                    repercussions. Mrs. X's husband might be the tradesman responsible for
                    maintaining equipment at the university's chemistry department. Mrs.
                    Y's husband might work for the mayor. Perhaps Mrs. W was married to the
                    state governor, or even an ambassador. Who knew what wide-reaching developments
                    might be aided by a husband's ability to perform well, instead of
                    feebly, on any given day?
                The Sellers company did its own part to persuade women that their labors were
                    valued, enumerating "Added Features That Cost Us Over $100,000
                        Annually."24 This level of investment by a
                    manufacturer certainly implies the importance of those for whom the investment
                    is made. Nowhere did this ad acknowledge that the cost of these added features,
                    which included an automatic lowering flour bin and ant-proof canisters, was
                    passed on to 
                        24Ibid., 76.
                    
                    
                    
                        Hoosier Manufacturing Company catalogs, including this one
                            from 1912, regularly included drawings comparing the steps required to
                            make a meal using a traditional pantry versus a Hoosier cabinet.

                    the buyers; instead, readers were allowed to imagine that these
                    improvements had been added for their benefit alone, and at the
                    manufacturer's expense. A variation on this ad, appearing in another
                    publication, claimed that providing the "Automatic Lowering Flour
                    Bin" cost the company $52,000 more per year than what the cabinet would
                    otherwise have cost to make. A third Sellers ad referred to their kitchen
                    cabinet as "The Best Servant In Your House."25 As with the previous examples, this one flattered would-be buyers,
                    implicitly crediting them with a kind of prestige they likely lacked: only those
                    who are powerful and important are actually in a position to employ
                    servants.
                Labeling their cabinet "The Indorsement [sic] of Success,"
                    Coppes Brothers' ad published by Pictorial Review in
                    1920 calls to mind Max Weber's take on the Protestant work ethic.26 Just as Weber posited that the work ethic had arisen from
                    the Protestant belief that earthly success could 
                        25Ibid., 80, 81.
                        26Ibid., 102.
                    
                    indicate an individual's status as
                    one of God's elect, and thereby provided motivation for the Christian
                    to prosper in earthly terms as a means of assuring himself that he was among the
                    chosen few, if a woman owned a "Dutch Kitchenet," she must be
                    successful. The cabinet's presence in her kitchen would be a badge of
                    her housekeeping prowess, as enviable as a modern-day Eagle Scout's
                    award. Imagine how the presence of this cabinet would impress family and
                    neighbors, with its suggestion that it could only have been bought by a husband
                    who greatly valued his wife and looked upon her household responsibilities with
                    the utmost seriousness. The many ads for Hoosier cabinets that cited numbers of
                    kitchen footsteps saved also underscored, by implication, the
                    housewife's value. Who would take the time to count her footsteps and
                    work to minimize them if those steps did not belong to someone important?
                Counting footsteps proved big business for the makers of Hoosier cabinets. The
                    idea of saving steps has been figurative for so long that most of us have
                    forgotten the origin of this expression in the literal movement of feet.
                    "How many steps in the kitchen preparing three simple meals?"
                    asked Coppes Brothers and Zook.27 Accompanied by a statement
                    from Mr. Harrington Emerson, the "Father of Efficiency
                    Engineers," and appearing next to a photograph showing H. H. Tice of
                    Emerson Engineers recording the time and motion involved in preparing a meal,
                    the ad proclaimed, "2,113 steps every day - 1,592 can be
                    saved!" Further copy termed these discoveries
                    "amazing" and "supremely important" - again
                    in line with Beecher's urging that the value of women's work
                    in the home receive due appreciation.
                With its promise to save footsteps by consolidating items in one
                    "centralized storehouse that has places for 400 articles, all within
                    arm's reach," the Hoosier cabinet fulfilled the day's
                    requirement to help the newly servant-less wife (and the wife who had never been
                    able to afford servants) run her household more efficiently.28 But there were other ads that personified the cabinet as a servant.
                    A 1916 ad for McDougall contains a veritable servant's vow. I will make each kitchen hour a joy - each meal a source

                            McDougall29 Like this one from
                    "Patience McDougall," an ad for the Boone cabinet made by
                    Campbell-Smith-Ritchie portrayed the Hoosier as a woman, "Helen
                    Boone." "Boone Cabinets as represented by
                    'Helen,' below, are beautiful. But they are also unique in
                    work-saving service. They are capable
                    because they incorporate the proved [sic], ultra-modern
                    advantages 369 Women, readers of The Ladies' Home Journal,
                        designed."30 Miss Boone's countenance
                    peers out from various corners of the cabinet as she points to its many helpful
                    features, among them a disappearing ironing board and "a mirror for
                    that hasty glance!" The suggestion seems to be that you, too, could
                    become capable and beautiful by using this cabinet. At the very least, Helen
                    Boone could replace your former servant who abandoned you, seeking factory work.
                    (Other competent and attractive members of the Boone family were known as Mary,
                    Betty, and Bertha.)
                Other advertisements did even better. Sex sells, and while its use may have been
                    somewhat veiled in much early twentieth-century advertising (at least, the
                    advertising directed at the kind of women whose families would have the means to
                    buy such household improvements), it was handily employed all the same. Why
                    portray a cabinet as a chaste, submissive girl or a sensible home efficiency
                    expert when you could personify it as a stunning, strapping man? The McDougall
                    Company seized this opportunity. "Handsome, tall and
                    competent," reads one ad from 1920, "your McDougall waits
                    cheerily in the kitchen every morning." Having helped get your family
                    ready for the day, McDougall then "hurries you out, smiling and fresh,
                    for a bit of relaxation." Rare among Hoosier cabinet ads, this one just
                    happens to picture a cabinet without its user; her stool sits empty with her
                    apron, discarded, lying suggestively on top. It is hard to view this ad without
                    imagining some additional kind of pleasure, unmentioned, that took place after
                    the work was done. Her husband and children having been ushered off to their
                    respective days, she has untied her apron strings and left the kitchen. What
                    occurred between this moment and the time when she hurried out of

                    that house so refreshed? The portrayal of the
                    "servant" continues in dignified terms: "Ancestral
                    leadership, steadfastly upheld, exhibits itself in fine character of
                    construction and complete convenience .... Lustrous beauty, sound oak
                    sturdiness, and rare utility combined."31 Taken as
                    a piece, this ad calls to mind images of the young Sean Connery, or perhaps
                    those musclebound men on the covers of the bodice-ripper romances that would
                    find their way into the kitchens of these same women several decades later.
                    There's nothing like the anticipation of romance to sweeten even the
                    dullest labors that must, by necessity, precede it.
                The unspoken promises that can reasonably be inferred to relate to sex went on.
                    These were, after all, the early decades of the twentieth century, a time when
                    all manner of supposedly outdated social notions were being abandoned. The
                    promise of sex, while less overt than it would become during the 1960s, was
                    everywhere. Just as today, there was strong pressure to be slender, youthful,
                    and energetic. Expectations of women, too, were changing; women's
                    demand for voting rights set in motion a train of social effects, one of which
                    was a new emphasis on how they appeared as individuals - not just in terms of
                    beauty, and not just as keepers of the house and mothers of children, but in
                    their capacity as partners within a marriage partnership. It was no longer
                    enough to be a responsible housekeeper, a good cook, and a caring mother; now
                    women began to be judged as conversation partners and objects of desire. There
                    were new standards to be met, and along with them, new reasons to feel anxious
                    and insecure. Just as today, self-doubt was insidiously nurtured by advertisers
                    so that it could then be profitably mined as a potentially inexhaustible means
                    to increase sales. Advertisements in Liberty Magazine, which
                    billed itself as "A Weekly for Everybody," featured ads for
                    Pepsodent toothpaste ("Cloudy Teeth - dull teeth. How to make them
                    whiter - quickly!"), Lemon Facialax skin-whitening cream, and
                    "Dr. Lawton's Automatic Waistline Reducer."
                    Editorials revealed "The TRUTH About BEAUTY SURGERY" and
                    quizzed women, "Do You Use Your Husband's Name? Or Are You of
                    Those Who Would Abolish 'Mrs.' from the Glossary of Married
                    Life?" Fiction included such offerings as "The Happy Hunting
                    Ground: A Short Story of a Girl Who Crossed the Sea to Look for a Rich Husband,
                    and Found Love Instead" and "White Pants Willie, The Story of
                    a Young Man Who Found Love and Adventure in Dazzling, Money-Drunk Palm
                        Beach."32
                Read with this larger social context in mind, the cabinet ads may be seen as
                    offering yet one more attractive benefit: by helping their users stay 
                        31Ibid., 120.
                        32Liberty Magazine, January 17,

                     beautiful, youthful, and energetic, the
                    cabinets could help save marriages. "Why be all fagged out and suffer
                    from backache and headache? Why be a kitchen drudge, waste your strength and
                    wear yourself out? A 'Dutch Kitchenet' will systematize your
                    kitchen work - make it easy and give you leisure time for rest and
                        recreation."33 The Sellers cabinet promised to
                    "conserve your strength to a remarkable degree."34 Hoosier agreed that "the greatest economies [women] can
                    effect are those of Time and Strength," allowing "more time
                    for rest and recreation," and for "porch breezes" in
                        summer.35 "The Hoosier will help me to stay
                    young," declares a bride to her mother, presumably on her wedding
                        day.36 "Save nerves, Save health,"
                    cries another Hoosier ad; yet another, "Think what this spare time
                    would mean to you day after day, if you worked sitting down so you could feel
                    rested enough to enjoy it."37 It is hard to read
                    page after page of advertising focused on the prevention of backaches,
                    headaches, "drudgery," and exhaustion in the context of a
                    married household where the husband would be paying for the purchase of any home
                    improvement without being put in mind of the kind of husband-generated
                    complaints the cabinets might be expected to help reduce.
                Other ads employ peer pressure of various kinds in an effort to have housewives
                    cajole their husbands into a purchase. "Are you fitting your daughter
                    by example and experience to be a successful home-maker?" asks a
                    McDougall advertisement from 1917. "Are you educating her for the
                    practical work of life? Are you teaching her true economy and
                    efficiency?" After pointing out that the cabinet can be had for only a
                    dollar a week, the ad continues, "You cannot spend this small amount in
                    any way that will be of greater daily benefit to your daughter, your family and
                        yourself."38 Using the same type of
                    rationalization, the Hoosier Manufacturing Company asserted in various
                    advertisements that "[a] Hoosier Cabinet is not an expense -
                    it's an investment."
                The pressure to be modern, to keep up with the times and avoid being left behind
                    by one's peers, is also employed. "You would not knowingly
                    per- mit, in your modern home, the doing of important work by methods that
                    belong to a drudging past," proclaims a Sellers ad from 1925.

                By far the greatest peer pressure was employed by the Hoosier Manufacturing
                    Company. A 1910 advertisement urged readers of Good
                        Housekeeping to join no fewer than 300,000 other women who had already,
                    according to this claim, cut out "all the disagreeable part"
                    of their kitchen work.40 Another, in 1914, put a
                    quasi-patriotic slant on the peer pressure theme, claiming to have more than
                    700,000 users-now more than double the number in 1910 - and promoting the
                    cabinet as a "national step saver for American
                    women." "Women all over the 
                        United States
                     praise the Hoosier," the ad continued. "You need
                    it, too."41 The political undertones of this
                    campaign were echoed in 1920, when an ad in The Saturday Evening
                        Post characterized the cabinet as a
                        "woman-emancipator."42 Another, in
                    1920, claimed to be not just improving daily life for American housewives, but
                    revolutionizing the fate of "Womankind," as evidenced by the
                    fact that kitchens were now being designed around the cabinet: "To-day
                    kitchens are actually being planned to fit the
                        Hoosier."43 By 1920 the Hoosier Manufacturing
                    Company could point a metaphorical finger at the housewife and urge,
                    "you need the HOOSIER - Now. It can do for you what it is doing for two
                    million other women."44
                Later ads shifted the focus from the reduction of drudgery to highlighting the
                    ways in which a Hoosier cabinet would transform the kitchen into a source of
                    delight, perfect for aiding the woman of the house to express lingering ideals
                    of supposed true womanhood. The McDougall cabinet promised to "make
                    each kitchen hour a joy" and claimed to "radiate good
                        cheer."45 The Sellers cabinet would
                    "bring beauty and color into the kitchen."46 By 1920 the Hoosier Manufacturing Company had decided to call one
                    of its models the "Hoosier Beauty," a name that would endure
                    for years; in 1925 one of the firm's advertisements declared the
                    kitchen "the one room exclusively a woman's ... and so the
                    kitchen should reflect cheer and

                    charm as well as provide comfort and
                        convenience."47 "It is the one
                    room," the ad continued, "where she may have her own way
                    without consulting others. Perhaps this is the very reason the kitchen is so
                    often last to get its due .... Yet every woman has her dreams of what this room
                    should be! ... [A]bove all, it would be a charming, restful
                    place, with dainty, feminine touches to cheer her work day along."48 In addition to the basic kitchen cabinet, the company
                    offered a breakfast set that would bring an "added touch of cosy [sic] cheer ... in White or French Grey Enamel, golden oak, or
                    painted to match your special color scheme. Whatever your choice, you have a
                    tastefully appointed, charming room." For the holiday season of the
                    same year, 1927, the company ran an ad in The Saturday Evening
                        Post that gives testament to the importance of color in its own right.
                        Sometime between now and Christmas a Hoosier dealer
                        in nearly every community will feature the new Hoosier Beauty Cabinet -
                        choice of five color combinations - and with it a beautiful 46-piece golden
                        maize dinner set, a 19-piece set of jade green glassware and a 10-piece
                        crystal set of kitchen glassware ... all for a small payment down....
                        You have a choice of five smart finishes - Silver or Golden Oak, White,
                        Wedgwood or Grey Enamel. Cupboard interiors are finished in scarlet, apple
                        green, orange or robin's egg blue. Doors are attractively decorated
                        to match.49 As so many advertisements of the
                    time pointed out, "The best part of a Hoosier kitchen is that you will
                    never know you've spent the money! For buying Hoosier furniture is now
                    reduced to the easiest, simplest terms."50
                Manufacturers rivaled each other to see who could devise the most irresistible
                    offerings. By 1930 Sellers was advertising its kitchen ensembles "in
                    the new Colored Oak," claiming to be "the style
                        leader in kitchen furniture - sponsor of the modern colorful kitchen
                    and of beautiful wood finishes."51
                To maximize the value of its advertising investment, the Hoosier Manufacturing
                    Company devised an ingenious way of gauging which ads generated the most
                    interest. As Philip Kennedy has pointed out, just as many companies today
                    include a department code on reader response cards,

                     different advertisements listed different
                    addresses for the company's main office in 
                        New
                            Castle
                    . When readers sent in a form requesting information, the company
                    could identify the source of their interest by the address. One ad listed the
                    office at 1027 Broad Street, another at 1127 Sidney Street. Earlier ads gave
                    various numbers on Maple Street, while 1410 Sidney Street and 135 Calhoun Street
                    also made appearances. No doubt the post office in New Castle was aware of this
                    ploy and delivered all the mail to the actual location of the main office, on
                    South 14th Street.52
                Another innovative marketing device employed by the Hoosier Manufacturing Company
                    was its annual kitchen design competition that took place in the early 1920s.
                    Advertising in professional publications, the company solicited entries from
                    designers and architects around the country for kitchen layouts that would
                    incorporate a Hoosier cabinet in the most attractive and efficient way. In one
                    year, 343 entries were submitted, 50 of which made their way into the slender
                    published volume entitled The Kitchen Plan Book. Reprinted in
                    1997 by American Bungalow Magazine, this book is a valuable
                    resource for today's restorers and designers of early
                    twentieth-century-style kitchens. But when it was originally published, the book
                    was much more.
                "The problem," as presented by the company, involved
                    "the design of a fully equipped kitchen for a family of four or five
                    without a servant."53 Accordingly, the competition
                    rules specified that the kitchen could not exceed 144 square feet - these
                    kitchens were to be exemplars for the small, "modern" house
                    without a space-wasting pantry. Besides the Hoosier cabinet, the kitchen was to
                    include the "essential requirements" of a sink with drain
                    board, range, and refrigerator. The actual purpose of the competition, however,
                    becomes clear on reading the company's "object."
                        This competition is being conducted ... to
                        encourage the study by architects and architectural draftsmen of
                        labor-saving devices and economies in plan and equipment for the modern
                        small-family kitchen. The acuteness of the servant problem has resulted
                        generally in increased kitchen activities on the part of individual members
                        of the family .... That a kitchen should be ... a really pleasant room to
                        work in ... is becoming recognized in larger measure in all communities. The
                        Hoosier Manufacturing Company, believing that a real demand
                            exists for standardization, hopes through this competition to bring
                        to the problem, the experience . . . of the architect and, with the
                        suggestions thus obtained,

                        expects to be able to submit to the
                        public and the architectural profession data and practical suggestions for
                        an up-to-the-minute model kitchen.54
                By publishing the "best" work of the nation's
                    architects and designers, who had been challenged to incorporate a Hoosier
                    cabinet most effectively into a kitchen, the manufacturer was attempting no less
                    than a revision of basic kitchen standards. The book was intended not just to
                    show architects and builders how to plan a kitchen that would offer the most
                    effective layout for using a Hoosier kitchen cabinet; more ingeniously, the book
                    was intended to make the Hoosier cabinet as indispensable a part of the kitchen
                    as a stove or sink. Remember, the title of this book is not "A Kitchen
                    Plan Book," but The Kitchen Plan Book. Ideally,
                    Americans would be left unable to imagine a kitchen that did not include a
                    Hoosier cabinet. What a quaint idea that would be! Of course a house must be
                    built with dedicated space for the Hoosier. No one in her right mind would wish
                    to go back to the time when a kitchen's storage and preparation areas
                    were limited to a "mere built-in contrivance, such as a series of
                    shelves and cupboards."55 By the time of this
                    competition, "[t]wo million women [had], by their purchases, placed the
                    stamp of approval on the Hoosier as 
                        America's
                     greatest household convenience."56 The
                    text concluded with the following coup de grace: "In planning a
                    kitchen, it is logical to leave a space in which the Hoosier
                    may be placed." And who would not wish to be logical in an era when the
                    values of "science" and "system" were so
                        vaunted?57
                Another significant factor in the Hoosier Manufacturing Company's
                    success was the company's masterly coordination of its advertising and
                    marketing schemes with a nationwide network of dealers. This collaboration made
                    the cabinets readily available to buyers even in rural locations many decades
                    before the development of general delivery services such as UPS. A 1915
                    publication for Hoosier retailers offers a brilliant example of the
                    company's dealer support. Published in broadsheet form, the Hoosier Kitchen Cabinet Book, as this publication is called,
                    is, at just over thirty pages, actually less a book than a promotional guide for
                    retail agents. The booklet promised cash prizes for the highest-performing sales
                    agents, who could win up to $500 on top of their ordinary retail markup.

                        The Hoosier Manufacturing Company provided its dealers with
                            a variety of press-ready advertising copy, including this from the Hoosier Kitchen Cabinet Book, 1915, for publication in
                            local newspapers. Advertising campaigns often led up to a promotional
                            sale. Courtesy of Henry County Historial Society

                    would translate into tens of thousands of dollars' worth of purchasing
                    power by today's standards and so must have provided dealers with a
                    powerful incentive to sell the Hoosier Manufacturing Company's wares.)
                    The contest would coincide with a nationwide promotional event whereby customers
                    could purchase a Hoosier cabinet for $2.50 less than the advertised price. This
                    price reduction was especially significant given that the Hoosier Manufacturing
                    Company strictly controlled the prices charged by its authorized dealers.
                To encourage participation in this promotional extravaganza, the text cites past
                    successes: "These sales have increased Hoosier business every year for
                    fifteen years in spite of wars, panics and periods of business depression. They
                    made the fall months of 1914 the biggest in Hoosier history. The new plan, we
                    believe, will increase your Hoosier business and your new customers beyond every
                    expectation you now think reasonable.58
                The booklet included guidance and materials for agents' in-store use. It
                    previewed the advertisements that would appear in national publications such as
                        The Saturday Evening Post and Woman's Home Companion. It instructed sellers exactly how to
                    set up their store windows to maximize profits and offered special tags to
                    enhance their displays. Store Card No. 1, for instance, noted, "PAY
                    ONLY $1. Balance $1 weekly."59 It offered dealers a
                    five-foot-long, green-and-white advertising poster and provided photographic
                    illustrations of how to display the cabinets to the dealer's best
                    advantage in the store.
                Furthermore, the booklet promised help with developing new customers by mail. In
                    it were reproduced sample letters with the following text that the Hoosier
                    Manufacturing Company would send to prospective customers in the
                    retailer's own locale. You already know a lot
                        of people who ought to be good prospects for Hoosier Cabinets. Some of these
                        people trade with you now; others don't. Before you make the
                        public announcement of your big Hoosier sale in the newspapers, why not send
                        a carefully written personal invitation to each of these women, giving them
                        the special privilege of coming in the week before the general public is
                        invited, and making her selection with- out rush or hurry. Almost every
                        select shop in the big cities uses this plan. It always makes one feel
                        especially favored to get an advance invitation of this sort.

                        You send us the names of all the people
                        who ought to own Hoosier Cabinets. We will write the above letter [as
                        indicated in the text] on the attractive little folder shown here - sign
                        your name to it, mail it - do all the work-pay for the printing - charge you
                        nothing but the postage. This letter, written by an expert advertising
                        man, carefully criticized by business men of wide experience, has already
                        been tested successfully. If we did not know it would produce a big increase
                        in your Hoosier sales, we could not afford to make this liberal offer.
                        Printing and handling of these letters alone, will cost us more than the
                        postage. Take advantage of this opportunity. It will have a big influence on
                        the success of your sale.
                On top of all these other types of aid, the company provided a week's
                    worth of press-ready advertisements for retailers to run in their local
                    newspaper. As may be expected, these ads became increasingly urgent in tone as
                    the week wore on, moving from "Next week will be too late"
                    through "DECIDE TONIGHT." The company also supplied painted
                    metal signs to "Bring Farmers to Your Store," colorful cards
                    for retailers to drive around with on their delivery trucks, attractive
                    pamphlets that could be customized with a retailer's store name and
                    sent out by mail to prospects' homes, and several pages with
                    illustrations of various Hoosier models, from "the low priced Hoosier
                    cabinet no. 1537 to no. 1549: "The Carrara All White Hoosier - cleans
                    like a porcelain bath tub."60
                As the garnish to this veritable feast of sales assistance, the booklet concluded
                    with three pages of step-by-step instructions on how the retailer ought
                    personally to demonstrate the Hoosier cabinet to prospective buyers who came
                    into the store. One of the most entertaining passages describes "Mrs.
                    Christine Frederick's Housekeeper's Food Guide, showing an
                    unlimited number of balanced menus," which was provided as a standard
                    feature in the upper section of the higher-priced models. Retail salesmen were
                    urged to praise the Guide, which "answers every day the perplexing
                    question, 'What shall I cook for dinner?' You simply turn the
                    dial until you see before you in the slot, the names of the meat you want. A
                    choice of perfectly balanced menus is before you. A great many women regard this
                    as the most important feature on the new Hoosier. It saves money, time and
                    worry." The text followed with the confidential advice, "Show
                    how the food guide operates, and ask the customer to operate it
                        herself."61
                By 1920 the Hoosier Manufacturing Company alone had sold two million cabinets,
                    which translated to getting its product into one in ten American homes. This
                    figure does not take into account a single one of the

                            sophisticated development of all forms of sales. The Hoosier
                            Manufacturing Company encouraged its retail dealers to stay on the
                            cutting edge and sell their wares aggressively. In their Hoosier Kitchen Cabinet Book, 1915, the company provided
                            detailed instruction, including a word-by-word script, for the salesmen
                            who would demonstrate their cabinets to prospective buyers.

                    "Hoosiers" that could be found in many thousands of other
                    households. The cabinets' penetration into the 
                        United States
                     market represented an unprecedented level of sales and reflected
                    the success of new methods of marketing and distribution. It is no wonder that
                    scholars use these companies' advertisements to examine our
                    nation's transformation from a production-based economy to a culture
                    increasingly identified and defined by consumption.62
                The cabinet itself had been designed in response to a set of readily discernible
                    socio-economic needs, at a time that coincided fortuitously with the development
                    of the ancillary industrial infrastructure that allowed the various cabinet
                    companies to maximize sales. But while these manufacturers benefited by
                    underscoring the values of systematic planning and efficiency, along with the
                    desirability of the cabinet's sleek, modern style, other developments
                    in the realm of kitchen furnishings were taking place that epitomized these
                    qualities even more relentlessly.
                By the 1930s, the Hoosier cabinet had begun to be cast as outdated and was being
                    rapidly supplanted in American kitchens by built-in cabinets. Although built-ins
                    were advertised as the truly modern kitchen furniture, they
                    were by no means an innovation of the 1920s, but had been a common feature in
                    many nineteenth-century houses, particularly those of the wealthier classes.
                    Although the butler's pantry is the best-known example, more modest
                    homes often had linen presses recessed into their kitchen and dining room walls.
                    Kitchens in some of the better endowed Shaker communities, such as 
                        Hancock
                     in 
                        Massachusetts
                    , were also sometimes furnished with built-ins.
                These earlier cabinets were site - built into the fabric of a house by skilled
                    carpenters, usually during the home's construction. As such, they were
                    absolutely fixed in place and could not be removed if a family relocated to a
                    new home. (One Hoosier cabinet company, Kitchen Maid, had portrayed its
                    product's portability as an asset in a 1919 advertisement.)63 Early built-ins were also relatively expensive, as they
                    required more refined carpentry than the basic construction and trimming out of
                    a house. As a result, they were uncommon among houses built for the working and
                    lower-middle classes.
                The manufacturers of freestanding kitchen cabinets had on more than one occasion
                    waged public relations campaigns against built-ins, which they recognized as a
                    potential threat in the market for middle-class kitchen

                    furnishings. A 1925 Sellers advertisement
                    contrasted the "modern cabinet," which had been
                    "scientifically developed for culinary purposes," with the
                    "crudities of built-in shelves and cupboards."64 To be sure, the Hoosier did exemplify many attributes of the modern
                    ethos, with its numerous mechanical parts, easy-to-clean surfaces, and
                    efficient, step-saving design. Yet when millwork companies marketed their new
                    modular built-ins, they found it easy to convince the housewife that their
                    designs took the best of the free-standing cabinets'
                    "modern" qualities even further. Unlike the Hoosier, built-in
                    cabinets extended down to the floor, eliminating the space underneath where dust
                    and dirt could collect. The new built-ins could also be fitted seamlessly from
                    one wall to another and topped with a sanitary counter, further reducing
                    opportunities for grime to accumulate. Moreover, because they were available in
                    different widths and depths, the new built-ins could accurately be described as
                    even more efficient than freestanding cabinets, as they enabled landlords and
                    homeowners to maximize opportunities for storage in even the most irregular
                    spaces. They were also modern in the sense of being widely available to nearly
                    everyone, thanks to the very principles of efficiency and standardization that
                    the Hoosier Manufacturing Company had helped to pioneer. On top of all this, the
                    new built-ins had an indisputably more streamlined appearance than their
                    freestanding counterparts, which gave them the ultimate claim to being
                    "modern."
                Several manufacturers of freestanding cabinets responded to the new kitchen
                    furnishing competition by differentiating their wares still further from what
                    some called "mere built-in contrivances." They cut back on
                    claims highlighting functionality and focused instead on their
                    products' aesthetic appeal and style. Colorfully painted Hoosier
                    cabinets became popular, their doors' panels sometimes enhanced with
                    stenciled designs. A 1930 catalog published by the Hoosier Manufacturing
                    Company, for example, included cabinets in ivory, spring green, grey, orchid
                    pink, and citrus yellow, available with a decorative "pipe
                    organ" design on the upper cupboard doors. Kitchen Maid offered its
                    cabinets in "beautiful Golden Oak and Snowy White Enamel."65 The Sellers company attempted to bolster sales by
                    adopting designs traditionally associated with more formal types of furniture,
                    offering its basic Hoosier in a vaguely Mediterranean version with
                    "gay, artistic effects of the Spanish type." Sellers also
                    advertised a quasi-Early American model characterized as
                    "colonial," and a streamlined variation they called
                    "Klear Front Modern American."66 Still
                    another way of attempting 
                        64Ibid., 87.
                        65Ibid., 144.
                        66Ibid., 88.
                    
                    to stimulate sales was to offer companion
                    products - dishes, glassware, or other kitchen furniture such as stepstools,
                    breakfast sets, and worktables - at special prices with the purchase of a
                    cabinet. A Hoosier Manufacturing Company advertisement in 1931 offered a
                    "complete Hoosier ensemble - 8 pieces $59.50 plus freight from
                    factory"; in addition to a Hoosier cabinet, the set included a stool,
                    breakfast table with four chairs, and kitchen worktable.67
                While each of these strategies may have boosted the manufacturers'
                    flagging sales, they proved futile as long-term responses to the introduction of
                    modular built-ins. Several manufacturers, including Sellers, Hoosier, and
                    McDougall, eventually began producing their own lines of modular kitchen
                    cabinetry. As Jacquelyn Star points out, "By 1935 free-standing kitchen
                    cabinets were considered old-fashioned. A reader from 
                        Ottawa
                    , 
                        Kansas
                     wrote to The Grand Rapids Furniture Record
                    requesting 'the address of some firm who makes the old style kitchen
                    cupboard with glass doors.'"68 The
                    Hoosier's heyday was over.

                The 1863 Diary of William H. Carroll, Mess No. 2, Company D, 24th Indiana
                    Volunteers
                William H. Carroll came from a family of farmers. His father Dixon and mother
                    Luticia moved with their family from 
                        North
                            Carolina
                    a (variously, in the late 1820s or early 1830s) and settled on land
                    in 
                        Daviess
                            County
                    , 
                        Indiana
                     Carroll (born in 1834 or 1835, depending on the source) grew up on
                    the family farm with his five brothers. When war came, five of the six brothers
                    fought for the Union: William and John in Company D of the 24th Indiana; Robert,
                    Nathaniel, and Dixon in Company G of the 42nd Indiana.1
                    William was mustered into the 24th Indiana Volunteer Infantry Regiment on July
                    2, 1861. He fought at Shiloh; was wounded at Champion Hill and remained with his
                    regiment through the siege of 
                        Vicksburg
                    ; reenlisted on December 31, 1863, in 
                        Louisiana
                    ; and fought almost until the end of the war, mustering out due to
                    multiple disabilities on May 29, 1865. By that time Carroll had developed severe
                    rheumatism and had impaired eyesight 
                        Initial transcription of the diary was done by Frank Carroll, a
                            great-great grandson of William. Mr. Carroll also provided copies of the
                            Carroll brothers' veterans records and of family histories
                            which were used in the introduction above. Mr. Carroll and his family
                            have generously donated the original diary, William Carroll's
                            original discharge, and a collection of family photographs to the Lilly
                            Library at Indiana University Bloomington.
                        1John (b. 1829) was mustered out of service in
                            July 1864, spent the rest of his life with a variety of illnesses and
                            injuries incurred during the war, and died in 1904; Robert (b. 1840) was
                            wounded at the Battle of Perryville in October 1862 when a bullet
                            fractured part of a vertebra and lived with disability in his hip and
                            leg until his death in 1912; Nathaniel (b. 1827) was wounded in the head
                            at the Battle of Stone River in December 1862 and died from the effects
                            of that injury in November 1864; Dixon (b. 1844) enlisted in March 1864,
                            was discharged in November 1865, and died in 1917.

                    " just prior to his discharge. Despite his health problems,
                    Carroll returned to farming. He married Mary Hovison on December 14, 1870, and
                    they raised two sons, Benjamin and Ewin. Carroll died in May 1891.
                In March 1863 Carroll purchased a small pocket diary bound in black leather. It
                    was divided into days, with eight lines of space for each entry. Carroll wrote
                    on the back of the righthand flyleaf: "Wm H Carroll His Diary price 65
                    ct Bought March The 10 1863." His diary entries begin on Monday, March
                    16; they continue regularly through October 19 but then for the remainder of the
                    year, save for two entries on December 17 and 18, the record is empty.
                    Carroll's handwriting is clear, but he strove to fit every possible
                    word into his daily allotted space, and his hand sometimes grew miniscule,
                    pushed to the limits of the inside binding and the outside of the page, or
                    curved up or down at the end of an entry.
                Carroll's spelling is inventive and probably reflects his southern 
                        Indiana
                     accent - his "helth is tolerble," and
                    "the Wether is fine the contry Butiful." Letters drop out of
                    words - his "brigad" is "orderd" to move; he
                    sees fellow soldiers "wonded" and "kild."
                    Unfamiliar words change spelling as Carroll learns about the South -
                    "byough" becomes bayou, "
                        Vixburg
                    " becomes 
                        Vicksburg
                    .
                
                The little diary tells the story of only eight months of Carroll's long
                    war service, and it begins slowly, with the regiment in camp at 
                        Helena
                    , 
                        Arkansas
                    , drilling and waiting for new orders. On April 11, Carroll wrote:
                    "To day wee leave 
                        Helena
                     for parts unknown to us." The brigade boarded a ship bound
                    south on the Mississippi
                        River and on the 13th Carroll and his comrades arrived at
                    Milliken's Bend, "Whare wee found 2 Brigads more of Grants

                                        transcription checking were done by the staff of the IMH.
                                        Empty square brackets indicate unclear or missing words or
                                        portions of words; letters within square brackets finish an
                                        otherwise unclear abbreviated word. Carroll's
                                        capitalization has been retained to the extent possible:
                                        some frequently capitalized letters, including R and W, are
                                        formed differently than the lower case; others, particularly
                                        the letter S, have fundamentally identical shapes whether
                                        lower or upper case, and the editors have made a best guess
                                        according to context, previous spelling of the word, and
                                        comparative size. Carroll's original prose often
                                        did not include standard punctuation, no doubt because of
                                        the shortness of each entry. In many entries, it is
                                        difficult to distinguish between punctuation and frequent
                                        pen marks, and so the editors have chosen to eliminate
                                        punctuation altogether. Above each entry we have used a
                                        version of the diary's own titles for each
                                        day.
                                    3Willis A. Gorman (1816-1876) was a
                                        former territorital governor of 
                                            Minnesota
                                        . Commissioned as Colonel of the 1st Minnesota
                                        Infantry at the outbreak of the war, Gorman was promoted to
                                        Brigadier General in October 1861 and commanded troops at
                                        the battles of Balls Bluff and Antietam. From December 1862,
                                        he commanded the District of Eastern Arkansas, Army of the
                                        Tennessee, until leaving the service in May 1864.

                                        in 1861. On November 29, 1862, after action at Fort
                                        Donelson, Shiloh, and Corinth, he was promoted to Brigadier
                                        General. After various brigade and division commands, he was
                                        mustered out in August 1865.

                                        is probably referring to the loss of Union ships at

                                        District of Eastern Arkansas. Alvin P Hovey (1821-1891)
                                        began the war as Colonel of the 24th Indiana and was
                                        promoted to Brigadier General in April 1862. He commanded
                                        the 12th Division of the XIII Corps during the battle for 
                                            Vicksburg
                                        , winning distinction during the Battle of
                                        Champion Hill. He received a brevet promotion to Major
                                        General in 1864. After the war he served 
                                            Indiana
                                         as a US Congressman (1886-1888) and Governor
                                        (1888-1891).
                                    9The 24th lost thirty-two men (killed,
                                        wounded, and missing) at Shiloh; Union losses exceeded 13,
                                        000. See Richard J. Fulfer, History of the

                                    10The first official black regiments
                                        were formed in April 1863 at 
                                            Milliken's
                                                Bend
                                         by Army Adjutant General Lorenzo Thomas. Fulfer
                                        records that on April 6 the entire brigade was addressed by
                                        Thomas, who "advocated that it would be much better
                                        to put the negroes up for a target to be shot at than for us
                                        to risk all of the danger ourselves." Fulfer, History of the Trials and Hardships,
                                        50-51, also records that "many of the boys
                                        deserted" upon hearing the news. Carroll's
                                        entry, in contrast, suggests that some of the troops helped
                                        to gather recruits from among the many former slaves who
                                        were following Grant's army. See also Martha M.

                                            considerable damage but did not destroy the
                                            fortifications. Grant was forced to settle on a landing
                                            point further south; he chose 
                                                Bruinsburg
                                            . Carroll also included a separate, longer

                                    27After Union troops entered 
                                            Jackson
                                        , they set about destroying rail tracks and
                                        telegraph lines and setting fire to factories and
                                        businesses. They left the town ungarrisoned and turned west
                                        toward 
                                            Vicksburg
                                        .
                                    28Confederate forces led by the
                                        commanding officer at 
                                            Vicksburg
                                        , Gen. John C. Pemberton, moved too late and too
                                        slowly to intercept Union troops at 
                                            Jackson
                                        . Instead they made their stand at 
                                            Champion Hill
                                        , where they thought to stop the Union advance.
                                        The 24th Indiana, led by Alvin Hovey and William Spicely,
                                        was one of the regiments which first met the Confederate
                                        line. More than three hours of intense fighting ensued
                                        before they were relieved by other regiments and could fall
                                        back. Gen. McGinnis called the battle "one of the
                                        most obstinate and murderous conflicts of the war";
                                        Spicely wrote of a "desperate and
                                        destructive" struggle "under the most
                                        galling fire I ever witnessed." The Confederate
                                        line was finally broken and the defeated troops retreated to 
                                            Vicksburg
                                        . Union losses were heavy: the 24th Indiana,
                                        from a force of about 500 men, suffered 207 killed and
                                        wounded in that single day. Carroll was among the wounded,
                                        as he notes in his diary, and his health continued to be an
                                        issue in the weeks and months afterward. See report of Brig.

                                         began on the 22nd. As a result of the two
                                        attempts, 659 Union troops were left dead between the lines
                                        of the two forces, with almost 3500 men wounded or
                                        missing.
                                    35Maj. Gen. Nathaniel Banks began
                                        moving his XIX Corps northward from the

                                         area in early April. On May 23, one day before
                                        Carroll's entry, Banks began his assault on 
                                            Port Hudson
                                        , a Confederate stronghold on the Mississippi
                                            River south of

                                        . After three direct, failed assaults in May and
                                        June, Banks's forces also settled in for a siege,
                                        which was broken by the surrender of 
                                            Port Hudson
                                         on July 7.
                                    36The request for burial actually came
                                        from Pemberton, who offered the truce because the stench of
                                        the rotting bodies was so intense.

                                            Logan's Approach, forces under the command of
                                            Maj. Gen. John Logan spent weeks digging a trench which,
                                            on June 22, arrived at the bottom slope of the 3rd Redan
                                            of the 
                                                Vicksburg
                                             fortress. The troops then tunneled under
                                            the redan and planted and detonated explosives. Union

                                             defenders spent 20 hours fighting in the
                                            crater caused by the explosion, with heavy casualties on
                                            both sides, but Logan's troops were unable to
                                            take even that small portion of the city's
                                            defenses. A similar attack was planned for early July
                                            but rendered unnecessary by the city's
                                            surrender.

                                    then Pemberton sent out a flag of truce Requesting Gen Grant to
                                    come on some conditional terms of Surrender for him but the Gen
                                    Refused any other than a complete surrender44 So at 3 o clock PM the fireing commenced a gain

                                             on July 5, Gen. Hovey wrote of his troops:
                                            "For more than forty days they were under
                                            constant fire, casualties happening daily in the midst
                                            of their camps; men were killed and wounded in their
                                            beds, at the table, in the rifle-pits, and yet, during
                                            all this long period, there was no murmur, no complaint.
                                            They were veterans and determined to succeed."

                                            was parole for his troops. Grant, as Carroll noted,
                                            initially refused but after consultation with his
                                            officers, offered the parole to Pemberton.

                                            Grant sent a telegram to his command: "The
                                            enemy surrendered this morning. The only term allowed is
                                            their parole as prisoners of war. This I regard as a
                                            great advantage to us at this moment. It saves,
                                            probably, several days in the capture, and leaves troops
                                            and transports ready for immediate service."

                A Fierce, Wild Joy presents the Civil War letters of Edward
                    Jesup Wood of 
                        Goshen
                    , 
                        Indiana
                    . Some ninety letters written by Wood to his wife Jane (now held by
                    the Indiana Historical Society) are presented in thirteen chronologically
                    arranged chapters; an additional three letters, two written by Wood and
                    published in 
                        Goshen
                     newspapers, and a third penned by Wood's Confederate
                    half-brother, appear in appendices. Editor Stephen E. Towne offers an
                    informative and perspicacious introduction providing biographical data and an
                    overview of the content and style of Wood's letters. He also provides
                    brief introductions to each chapter, a postscript on Wood's postwar
                    life, and numerous explanatory endnotes for the letters.
                Wood was born in 
                        Florida
                     in 1834, the son of a 
                        Connecticut
                     steamboat captain and a mother from a plantation family. After his
                    father's death in 1840, Wood was raised in 
                        New York
                     by relatives, schooled in 
                        Connecticut
                    , and graduated at age 18 from Dartmouth College as an engineer.
                    Arriving in 
                        Indiana
                     in 1853 to work on the construction of a railroad, he soon went
                    into law and politics, running for local office as a Republican. He married in
                    1859, and in May 1861 his first child was born. The following fall, Wood began
                    recruiting a company for the 48th Indiana Volunteer Infantry Regiment. He began
                    as a captain in charge of a company and over time became the commanding colonel
                    of the 48th. The letters cover the period from January 16, 1862, to February 27,
                    1865, during which Wood participated in such battles as Corinth and Champion
                    Hill, the siege of 
                        Vicksburg
                    , and Sherman's March to the Sea.
                While Wood's letters include a few intriguing combat narratives,

                    their major interest comes from their
                    accounts of other aspects of military life. Wood is especially thorough in his
                    descriptions of camp accommodations, the movement of men and their baggage, and
                    diet and the procurement of food. His training in law and engineering was put to
                    good use as he found himself, at various times, put in charge of road and bridge
                    construction, detailed to serve as a court-martial judge, and assigned to the
                    office of provost marshal. (His account of his actions as provost of 
                        Paducah
                     is especially informative.) Wood's letters also nicely
                    describe sundry other aspects of camp life, from picket duty to a fishing picnic
                    with other officers. Among their most unusual passages are those dealing with
                    Wood's efforts to gain information about his southern relatives and
                    find ways to communicate with them. A particularly poignant entry juxtaposes
                    Wood's hard hand-of-war values with his awareness of what his Dixie
                    loved ones are suffering at the hands of Union troops.
                Oddly enough, Wood, an abolitionist, writes little about the slavery issue, and
                    what little he has to say about blacks is sometimes insensitive. Concepts such
                    as order and duty seem more central than slavery to Wood's
                    understanding of the war and his role in it. It also seems odd that Wood, who
                    ran for office in 
                        Indiana
                     both before and after the war, has so little to say about Hoosier
                    politics. In fact, Wood does not appear to have closely identified with his
                    adopted state, and he talks of Hoosiers in the third person as if he were not
                    one of them. His wife left 
                        Indiana
                     to live in her native upstate 
                        New York
                     during the war, and neither of them had much good to say about 
                        Goshen
                     or Hoosierdom.
                Beyond war and politics, Wood's letters also provide some insights into
                    the values and domestic life of a northern, urban middle-class family. There are
                    numerous expressions of Christian fatalism, advice on child-rearing, and career
                    concerns. Also common are passages articulating the affections and the longings
                    for reunion of a man long separated from wife and daughter. Finally, a number of
                    passages deal with Wood's literary tastes and the titles of fictional
                    works that he was reading.

                A Little More Freedom African Americans Enter the Urban
                        Midwest, 1860-1930 By Jack S. Blocker (
                        Columbus
                    : Ohio State University Press, 2008. Pp. xvii, 330. Illustrations,
                    notes, appendices, index. Clothbound, $49.95; CD, $9.95.)
                Jack S. Blocker argues that most African Americans arriving in 
                        Illinois
                    , 
                        Indiana
                    , and 
                        Ohio
                     during and after the Civil War settled in
                    "nonmetropolitan" areas but gradually left them for cities.
                    Northern migration, Blocker writes, reflected the "mental
                    maps" that black migrants carried with them - personal images that
                    reflected their interests. Their quality of life in the Midwest depended on
                    local economies, the attitudes and actions of whites, and the conditions within
                    each black community. While violence between 1885 and 1910 shaped migration
                    patterns, population decline in the region's towns was slow and
                    steady.
                This book focuses on four of the region's 364 towns containing at least
                    2,500 residents: 
                        Washington Court House
                     and 
                        Springfield
                    , 
                        Ohio
                    ; 
                        Springfield
                    , 
                        Illinois
                    ; and 
                        Muncie
                    , 
                        Indiana
                    . It is organized into three parts. The first deals with waves of
                    migration before 1890. Part two (1860-1910) examines conditions that migrants
                    found and how they coped with them. The last section explores (mostly after
                    1910) "the choices made by migrants before leaving the South as well as
                    those that brought them to some destinations rather than others in the Lower
                    Midwest" (p. 12).
                While providing a wealth of material and analysis - including twenty graphs and
                    thirty-five tables - and demonstrating wide reading in primary and secondary
                    sources, the author disappoints the reader. Information is difficult to digest,
                    partly because of the author's writing style. Unexplained statistical
                    jargon (for example, in the two tables on pp. 79-80) reinforces the impression
                    that the author is addressing a specialized audience. Language issues persist
                    throughout the volume. The writer never defines "metropolitan"
                    - the reader must assume that this is the federal census term introduced in 1910
                    - and uses such terms as rural, village, town, small city, and non-metropolitan
                    interchangeably. He calls these decades "the age of the
                    village" (p. 214), yet all of the places he describes had at least
                    2,500 residents, and hence by census terminology were urban.
                Factual and interpretive errors appear too frequently - for example, the
                    locations and dates of Ohio
                        River bridges (p. 23), the account of the election of blacks to
                    state legislatures (p. 90), and the analysis of black settlement patterns in 
                        Kentucky
                     and her three Northern neighbors (pp. 140, 150), which asserts that
                    blacks in the lower Midwest forsook rural neighborhoods for urban ones after
                    1890. In fact, from the early 1800s onward, the largest number of black
                    newcomers settled directly in the biggest
                    cities - 
                        Indianapolis
                    , 
                        Cincinnati
                    , and 
                        Louisville
                    .
                The author also incorrectly attributes the post-1900 declension in 
                        Evansville's
                     black population to the race riot of 1903. Violence influenced
                    settlement patterns in the Ohio Valley generally, but more
                    telling was the growth of Jim Crow policies - for example, the creation of
                    restrictive covenants in real estate transactions. Most settlements along both
                    sides of the Ohio,
                    moreover, experienced population decline or stagnation - white as well as black
                    - after 1890, reflecting limited local job opportunities and the appeal of
                    industrial employment to the north. 
                        Evansville
                    , 
                        Cincinnati
                    , and 
                        Louisville
                     were notable exceptions. Blocker incorrectly attributes
                    blacks' departure from the former city to its lack of prosperity, when
                    in fact 
                        Evansville
                     tripled in size between 1880 and 1920, and its economy thrived. He
                    also overlooks the relatively small size of 
                        Evansville's
                     black community, as compared with upriver 
                        Cincinnati
                     and 
                        Louisville
                    , where a critical mass supported black businesses and professions,
                    despite a history of violence against blacks.
                A Little More Freedom, in short, offers much information about
                    African American settlement in the lower Midwest prior to 1910. Whether the book
                    offers a new interpretation of this period remains to be seen.

                    Meredith Nicholson A Writing Life By Ralph D.

                In the early 1900s, Meredith Nicholson was a household name, not just in 
                        Indiana
                    , but in most homes of literate Americans. Acclaimed for his
                    best-selling romantic adventure novels, he was one of four central figures in 
                        Indiana's
                     golden age of literature, alongside James Whitcomb Riley, Booth
                    Tarkington, and George Ade. Now, a century later, Nicholson's name is
                    barely recognized - a fact that Ralph D. Gray has sought to remedy with his
                    biography, Meredith Nicholson: A Writing Life.
                Gray, professor emeritus of history at Indiana University-Purdue University
                    Indianapolis, is best known for his scholarship on the history of transportation
                    and the history of 
                        Indiana
                    , which has included brief
                    examinations of Nicholson. He also recently collected his favorite examples of
                    Nicholson's essays and articles in A Meredith Nicholson
                        Reader (2007). Here, however, in what is, surprisingly, the first full
                    biography of the author's life, Gray provides a meticulously
                    researched, richly detailed history of Nicholson's life as both author
                    and diplomat.
                Seven chapters chronicle the development of Nicholson from ninth-grade dropout
                    into newspaper and magazine journalist, poet, state historian, novelist,
                    essayist, and (in one unsuccessful attempt) playwright. While romantic adventure
                    novels dominated Nicholson's tremendous output of 29 books, Gray
                    asserts in the introduction that "his finest writing, and his most
                    substantial and enduring contributions to American letters, can be found in his
                    essays and articles" (p. 5). Nevertheless, Gray gives his highest
                    praise to The Hoosiers (1900), "a remarkably full and
                    detailed study of 
                        Indiana's
                     literary, social, and political culture" (p. 63); The House of a Thousand Candles (1905), a mystery/adventure
                    novel and his most popular book; and A Hoosier Chronicle
                    (1913), which Gray considers to be Nicholson's "most
                    significant" and probably best novel, as well as his first venture into
                    realism.
                Three other chapters chronicle Nicholson's political career, beginning
                    in the 1920s with a chaotic and transformative decade of his life that other
                    biographers have failed to address. Gray effectively captures
                    Nicholson's fading glory as novelist - unable to successfully navigate
                    the shift in readers' and critics' tastes from romantic to
                    realistic fiction - and his rising reputation as a statesman and as a political
                    and social writer. These new roles brought their own difficulties: Along with an
                    unsuccessful bid for the state senate, Nicholson was one of 
                        Indiana's
                     few publicly outspoken critics of the Ku Klux Klan. This unsettling
                    period of his life ended with the death of his wife Eugenie, but he soon
                    remarried and entered eight years of diplomatic service in 
                        Paraguay
                    , 
                        Venezuela
                    , and 
                        Nicaragua
                    .
                The book concludes with a synopsis of the years following Nicholson's
                    return to the 
                        United States
                     in 1941. The chapter has an unavoidably melancholy tone, as
                    Nicholson tries to reestablish a home and a writing career in his beloved 
                        Indiana
                    , despite loneliness and a collapsing marriage. Yet Gray asserts the
                    import of Nicholson's stature and reputation in 
                        Indianapolis
                     until his death in 1947, at the age of 81.
                While the book's subject matter may seem to be of interest only to
                    students of 
                        Indiana
                     literature and history, its significance as the first - and
                    undoubtedly only - biography of this once major American author and public
                    figure is not to be overlooked. Nor is Gray's expert handling of his
                    subject matter. He avoids the common tendency to divide Nicholson's
                    life into two distinct halves, as writer and statesman. Rather, as
                    Gray's subtitle makes clear, he
                    unifies the whole of Nicholson's career into
                    "a writing life." The result is a coherent, compelling study
                    with only minor shortcomings: a few instances of unwieldy prose that is
                    otherwise is clear and elegant, and, in discussion of events spanning 1938 to
                    1943, a few confusing shifts in chronology. Such lapses are negligible, however,
                    in light of the book's sizable contributions to 
                        Indiana's
                     literary and historical scholarship.
                As Gray recalls in his final chapter, the New York Times called
                    Nicholson "the last leaf on a famous literary tree that grew in 
                        Indiana
                    " (p. 243). Thanks to Ralph Gray's insistence that
                    the life and work of Meredith Nicholson are still worth considering, despite the
                    shifting literary winds of the last century, Nicholson's place on that
                    tree will remain secure.

                Steel Shavings, Volume 39
                    Brothers in Arms Edited by James B. Lane (
                        Gary
                    : Indiana University Northwest, 2008. 240 pages. Illustrations,
                    index. Paperbound, $12.50.)
                In this latest volume of the Steel Shavings series - a social
                    history journal focusing on the Calumet region of northwest 
                        Indiana
                     - historian James B. Lane has again woven together a
                    thought-provoking, often entertaining, and at times tragic collection of oral
                    histories and recollections from Vietnam veterans. The series first featured the
                    stirring voices of local Vietnam veterans in 1988, when history students at
                    Indiana University Northwest compiled oral interviews in conjunction with
                    Professor Lane's course on the war. At a time when Reagan-era
                    revisionists were attempting to recast the Vietnam conflict as a noble and
                    winnable endeavor, Lane and his students intended to reinforce the real
                    "lessons of Vietnam" - from the hazards of misunderstanding
                    vital national interest to the absence of a clearly defined exit strategy - by
                    using the reminiscences of the working-class men and women who paid for those
                    mistakes in southeast Asia. Now, twenty years later, with the 
                        United States
                     again groping for answers in another unconventional war,
                    Lane's students have gathered together another album of visceral
                    testimony in the hopes of revisiting many of those apparently still unheeded
                    lessons of Vietnam.
                As one soldier explains, every veteran has his own story; no two are the same.
                    Indeed the real value of this Steel Shavings volume rests in
                    the richness and multiplicity of perspectives
                    from these soldiers, many of whom are drawing on lives well-lived, and
                    not-so-well-lived, to make sense of their distinctive place in the Vietnam
                    experience. More than fifty IUN students conducted the loosely structured oral
                    histories around such themes as how veterans found themselves in 
                        Vietnam
                    , how they experienced life "in country" and upon
                    return to "the world," and how they assess the impact of
                    Vietnam on their lives.
                A certain stoicism, often fatalism, emerges from these pages, as many veterans
                    from this steel mill region of 
                        Indiana
                     that sent a disproportionate number of its sons to 
                        Vietnam
                     recall their decision to enlist, instead of waiting to be drafted,
                    and their curious baptism into the surreal logic of war. For some, 
                        Vietnam
                     was a land of fantastic flora and fauna: elephants and elephant
                    grass, tigers, leeches, mosquitoes, and lizards whose cries sounded remarkably
                    like obscenities. Others evoke the unforgettable smells of the war-sweat,
                    gunpowder, diesel fuel, rain, and the sickeningly sweet stench of death. Nearly
                    all work to articulate in some haunting way the raw emotions of human suffering
                    and the senseless waste of young lives both interrupted and too often cut short.
                    Not surprisingly, strong feelings of mistrust and cynicism - toward the
                    government in general and military adventurism more specifically - permeate
                    these pages, as does a pronounced aversion to the idea of sending their own sons
                    to be exploited in undeclared wars. In addition to the powerful oral histories,
                    Lane wisely includes other primary source materials, including selections from
                    contemporary newspaper columns and sundry letters, diaries, poems, memoirs, and
                    photographs, to further establish the authentic look and feel of the Vietnam
                    era. In fact, the volume's most provocative passages are those excerpts
                    from L.T. Wolf's Soldier's Viet-nam (1996)
                    and Joe Klein's fine book Payback: Five Marines After
                        Vietnam (1984) about the heartrending odyssey of a veteran named Gary
                    Cooper.
                Ultimately, as the bloodshed and horror of Vietnam increasingly fade from our
                    collective consciousness, the memories included in this volume of Steel Shavings realize Lane's aim of reiterating the harsh
                    lessons of what George Kennan judged the most disastrous of all American
                    undertakings. In doing so, he and his students capture the simple dignity of
                    these unheralded Vietnam veterans who, in serving their country, often
                    "walked the line between heroism and cowardice, proud but with few
                    illusions" (p. 112).

                    Robert E Kennedy and the 1968 Indiana Primary By Ray E. Boomhower(
                        Bloomington
                    : Indiana University Press, 2008. Pp. xii,173. Illustrations,
                    bibliography, notes, index. $21.95.)
                At the outset of the 1968 campaign, Robert Kennedy remarked that he was the only
                    serious candidate ever to run for President opposed by business, organized
                    labor, and his own party's leadership. That was certainly the case
                    during the Indiana primary, the first contest on the calendar for Kennedy after
                    his late entry into that tumultuous year's fateful presidential race.
                    In 
                        Indiana
                    , Kennedy took on the state's Democratic establishment in
                    the name of Governor Roger Branigin, who had put himself on the ballot as a
                    stand-in for the soon-to-be lame duck President Lyndon Johnson. He also
                    confronted The Indianapolis Star, which attacked Kennedy on
                    its front and editorial pages almost daily. Add the fact that Senator Eugene
                    McCarthy had already won over many of 
                        America's
                     young activists for his willingness to challenge LBJ in the New
                    Hampshire and Wisconsin primaries, and Kennedy was, in a sense, on his own in 
                        Indiana
                    , forced to write a new playbook.
                Ray Boomhower's excellent Robert Kennedy and the 1968
                        Indiana Primary details how Kennedy navigated his campaign to victory
                    through this singularly inhospitable terrain. 
                        Indiana
                     was an even more unlikely state in which to lay down his
                    presidential marker than 
                        West
                            Virginia
                     had been for his brother in 1960. 
                        Indiana
                     was known as a conservative Republican state. "Hoosiers
                    are phlegmatic, skeptical, hard to move, with a 'show-me'
                    attitude," wrote native Hoosier reporter and campaign advisor John
                    Bartlow Martin in a memo to Kennedy. George Wallace had carried almost one-third
                    of the Indiana Democratic primary vote just four years earlier. To win, Kennedy
                    needed to mold together a new coalition of voters comprising what syndicated
                    columnist Joseph Kraft called "Black Power and Backlash."
                Kennedy's highly visible work on civil rights issues as Attorney General
                    and U.S. Senator had already earned him strong loyalty among the
                    state's African American population. But it was Kennedy's
                    "mysterious chemistry with lower classes," as reporter and
                    former Kennedy adviser Jack Newfield called it, that allowed him to make
                    critical inroads among the state's white blue-collar workers and family
                    farmers. These voters - Slavs, Poles, Italians, and Irish as well as
                    "rednecks" up from 
                        Kentucky
                     and 
                        Tennessee
                     - were among the neglected and sometimes resentful voters whom
                    Richard Nixon came to call 
                        "America's
                     Silent Majority." Kennedy also worked to capture a share
                    of the youth vote by courting voters in college communities. So it was that
                    Kennedy came to be the first political leader in the late 1960s to try to bring
                    together an 
                        America
                     torn apart by racial divisions
                    and an unpopular war.
                Most fascinating is Boomhower's description of how the Kennedy campaign
                    adjusted itself to the Hoosier state's conservative style and pace.
                    Kennedy began to limit the more frenetic campaign events, although his celebrity
                    made such an effort difficult as spectators would literally grab for a piece of
                    him during campaign appearances, coming away with strands of clothing and locks
                    of hair. Martin had encouraged Kennedy to make campaign visits to the
                    state's historic sites to demonstrate his understanding of
                    "Hoosier pride." He also pressed Kennedy to visit the backlash
                    factory towns in central 
                        Indiana
                    , followed by a whistle-stop railroad trip on the famous Wabash
                    Cannonball.
                Kennedy also toned down his message, emphasizing his tough law-and-order
                    background and his support of policies to move people from welfare to work.
                    Kennedy strongly believed his message of "self reliance" and
                    "community action" to fight poverty as an alternative to big
                    government programs, and he delivered it to black and white audiences alike,
                    although many liberals cringed. By turns, he charmed and challenged his
                    audiences, calling on voters to take personal responsibility for making 
                        America
                     better. Hoosiers came to Kennedy skeptically, but they found unique
                    honesty and authenticity.
                The best remembered moment from Kennedy's 1968 Indiana primary campaign
                    is, of course, is his visit to an 
                        Indianapolis
                     inner-city park, where he informed a mostly African American crowd
                    of Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination just minutes before.
                    Boomhower begins his book with a recounting of that day - April 4, 1968 - and a
                    reiteration of the spontaneous words by Kennedy that not only quelled a riot but
                    still stand as one of the most moving campaign speeches in American political
                    history.
                Robert Kennedy's 1968 campaign has been called the "last good
                    campaign," a moniker with which the supporters of Barack Obama might
                    now quarrel. Like Obama, Kennedy launched his campaign with the promise to bring
                    together an 
                        America
                     divided by an unpopular war. And, like Obama, Kennedy sought to
                    practice a new kind of politics in which ordinary citizens could shape their own
                    and their country's destiny and to push Americans to pursue a higher
                    purpose than mere accumulation of wealth. This book is a must-read for anyone
                    interested in presidential politics.

                The Girl in the Tangerine ScarfBy Mohja Kahf(
                        New
                            York
                    : Carroll and Graf, 2006. Pp. 444. Paperbound, $15.95.)
                Literary critic and poet Mohja Kahf makes her novelistic debut with The Girl in the Tangerine Scarf, a female bildungsroman set in the American heartland. Khadra Shamys, a young
                    Syrian-born girl and the protagonist of the novel, journeys with her family to 
                        Indiana
                    , where her parents aspire to spread the word of the prophet and to
                    help fellow Muslims perfect their practice of Islam. Chosen for its central
                    location, "international airport, low crime rates, and affordable
                    land," 
                        Indianapolis
                     becomes the destination of choice for Khadra's sincere,
                    mission-minded parents. Intent on instilling the "Islamic
                    Lifestyle" among wayward Muslims, Khadra's parents have no
                    compunctions about policing the religious behavior of their friends. Khadra is
                    nurtured by a tight-knit, cosmopolitan community of Muslim aunties and uncles,
                    comprising African Americans, Arabs, South Asians, and Cambodians. In spite of
                    the social cement provided by Islam, the community is marked by sectarian
                    tensions between Sunnis and Shias, the racial prejudices of Arab members against
                    their African and African American cohorts, and differences in economic
                    status.
                Through her protagonist, Kahf explores the complications and contradictions of
                    identity at a number of different levels, asking what it means to be Muslim, a
                    Muslim feminist, an Arab, a Hoosier, and an American. As the novel progresses,
                    Khadra sheds her simplistic understanding of each of these identities and gains
                    a more complex one. During her sojourn in 
                        Syria
                     following her divorce, she has an epiphany regarding Sufism, an
                    experience that challenges the religious orthodoxy of her youth and helps to
                    solidify her burgeoning feminism. She acquires a real knowledge of
                    multiculturalism on the same trip through her interactions with Syrian Jews and
                    her recognition of their claims to an authentic Syrian identity. After returning
                    to the 
                        United States
                    , Khadra similarly articulates a multicultural American identity,
                    delighting in the ethnic and religious diversity of 
                        Philadelphia
                    , where she has moved to escape 
                        Indiana
                     and to pursue a degree in photography. Her conception of Islam
                    expands to incorporate a wide range of practices. Yet, as Kahf revealed in a
                    recent radio interview, prayer constitutes the "secret embedded
                    structure of the novel" (www.whhb.org/news/newstopics.php?tid=3). One
                    of her goals was to represent material practices of Islam such as qiyam, ruku,
                    sajda, and juloos (each term describes a specific bodily posture and spiritual
                    stage during the ritual of prayer). Another aim was to convey the texture of
                    Muslim material culture by evoking memories of the fashion for Kuwaiti tie-back
                    head scarves and black  velvet pictures of
                    Kaba that were popular in the seventies.
                For Khadra, changes in her Islamic consciousness necessarily entail realigning
                    her understanding of American identity. She begins to see parallels between the
                    experiences of her community and those of other religious minorities,
                    particularly Mormons, Catholics, and Jews. The 
                        United States
                     becomes visible as a religious mosaic populated by the Amish,
                    Native Americans, Presbyterians and Quakers; the charming Mrs. Moore (a literary
                    reference to E.M. Forster), for example, is a Friend who speaks a smattering of
                    Arabic and regularly contributes her rhubarb pies to the Muslim
                    community's celebrations. Indeed, by the end of the novel Khadra has
                    another epiphany regarding parallels between Muslims and Midwesterners:
                    "Hoosiers - set in their ways, hardworking, steady, valuing God and
                    family ... they're us, and we're them. Hah! My folks are the
                    perfect Hoosiers!" (p. 438).
                Kahf also successfully decenters dominant American narratives about geopolitics
                    by describing Arab perceptions and reactions to an all-too muscular and imperial
                    foreign policy. The characters express horror at the Sabra and Shatila
                    massacres, cheer the overthrow of the Shah of Iran, avidly follow the first
                    Intifada, experience outrage at Syrian Baathist attempts to strip women of
                    hijab, and mourn the aerial bombings of 
                        Iraq
                     with their attendant massive civilian casualties. A worthy addition
                    to the emergent canon of ethnic literature, the novel importantly challenges
                    readers to adopt a more international perspective. However, occasional
                    colloquialisms, along with the earnest didacticism of some passages, mar the
                    novel's otherwise lyrical prose.

                The ShawneeBy Jerry E. Clark(
                        Lexington
                    : University Press of Kentucky, 2007. Pp. ix, 105. Illustrations,
                    bibliography, index. Paperbound, $18.00.)
                This brave little book, originally published in 1977, attempts a survey of the
                    culture and history of the eighteenth-century Shawnee, the tribe most associated
                    with contesting the white settlement of the Old Northwest. Despite their
                    importance, the Shawnee had then attracted few serious scholars, and most of the literature was
                    superficial, vague, and inaccurate. The best published research, by such
                    pioneers as Erminie Wheeler Voegelin and Charles Hanna, treated only limited
                    aspects of what was a large, complicated, and legendary field. Undeterred, Jerry
                    E. Clark offered an introduction remarkable for its breadth, tackling issues as
                    diverse as musical styles, folklore, migration, technology, and inter-tribal
                    relations. Fishing such murky waters, the book does not entirely succeed but
                    still repays study.
                The author, an anthropologist, is weakest on the straight history, and there are
                    misleading errors. We are told that 
                        Kentucky
                     was "the only territory" the Shawnee
                    "could possibly consider as a homeland" (p. 94), a statement
                    incompatible with the fact that the tribe established hardly any substantial
                    villages there (Eskippakithiki being an unusual exception) but some forty
                    further north in 
                        Ohio
                    , which some Shawnees declared to be an ancestral home. Even more
                    jarring is the assertion that "Tecumseh gathered a force from several
                    tribes and made raids on the 
                        Kentucky
                     settlements of 
                        Blue Licks
                    ...and 
                        Bryan
                            Station
                    " (pp. 92-3), which attributes hostilities that occurred in
                    1782, when Tecumseh was a boy, to a movement he would launch after 1806! Readers
                    wanting a surer-footed introduction to the crucial role the tribe played between
                    1740 and 1820 are better served by Colin Calloway's The
                        Shawnees and the War for 
                            America
                         (2007). Clark is stronger when he deals with the
                    fragmentation of the tribe in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries,
                    for which he draws upon his doctoral dissertation on Shawnee migration. His
                    outline of the confusing movements of Shawnees at that time, the motives that
                    impelled them, and the relationships they formed with different Indian and white
                    communities is useful and thoughtful.
                Clark is more comfortable reconstructing the culture of the Shawnees, and his
                    discussion ranges widely and intelligently. His view that the tribe was
                    characteristically conservative, despite extensive interaction with other
                    peoples and a growing dependency upon European manufactures, is worthy of more
                    detailed investigation. But even here the sources are often more treacherous
                    than Clark suspects. Some contemporaries, such as John Johnston, sometime 
                        United States
                     Indian agent to the Shawnee, colored accounts of Shawnee life with
                    observations actually made of other tribes, while most modern historians have
                    overly furnished theirs from descriptions of Shawnee society as it existed in
                    the late nineteenth or twentieth centuries, as if it had not just passed through
                    the most radical period of cultural change in its known history. Among many
                    wearisome anachronisms projected into the past by such historians is confusion
                    about the five different divisions of Shawnee in the eighteenth century. Here,
                    Clark errs in stating that the tribal chieftainship of the Shawnee was a prerogative of the Chillicothe
                    division (p. 33). It was actually exercised by the Mekoche division, and the
                    famous civil chief Black Hoof was not a Chillicothe (p. 16), but a volubly
                    patriotic Mekoche. Divisional differences in practices also make generalizations
                    about the Shawnee as a whole difficult. Thus what Clark calls "the
                    Shawnee myth of origin" (p. 52), involving a voyage over water, was
                    actually a Chillicothe rather than a "tribal" myth, and the
                    Mekoches had a very different account of their origins.
                Our picture of the authentic eighteenth-century Shawnees is still blurred and
                    fragmentary, but archaeological research and newly discovered documentary
                    sources are slowly sharpening the image. It is a pity that the University Press
                    of Kentucky did not give Clark an opportunity to revise his book, and weigh
                    recent research. As it is, it needs to be used cautiously. Nevertheless, its
                    comprehensiveness makes it an excellent starting point for any investigation of
                    this remarkable people during their great days in 
                        Kentucky
                     and the Old Northwest.

                Planning for the Lewis and Clark expedition began in early 1803. The expedition
                    itself lasted from 1803 to 1806. Planning for the commemoration of the
                    expedition's bicentennial began some ten years before the actual
                    January 2003 opening ceremonies. The expedition involved thousands of people in
                    its planning, administration, and execution. The bicentennial involved millions,
                    from those who worked in its planning stages to those who attended events on
                    local, state, and national levels. Contemporary media coverage of the expedition
                    was scant, and published accounts were relatively few. Not so for the
                    bicentennial. The sum total of all the related events, publications, films,
                    products, etc., easily numbered in the thousands. Some bicentennial efforts were
                    better than others and made a more lasting contribution to the Lewis and Clark
                    legacy. From the beginning of planning,
                    organizers committed to having meaningful Native American input and involvement.

                    possible, they saw the bicentennial as an opportunity to tell the Indian side of
                    the Lewis and Clark story and also to address the issues and challenges faced
                    today by the descendants of those native peoples whom the Corps of Discovery
                    encountered.
                This effort was largely successful. Significant Native American participation in
                    the bicentennial led to some of the most important results of the entire
                    commemoration. The Newberry Library's exhibition, "Lewis and
                    Clark and the Indian Country," looked not only at the Corps'
                    interactions with native peoples but at its impact in the years that followed.
                    Lewis and Clark were the leading edge of a people and a government that would
                    sweep across the American West and permanently change the lives and cultures of
                    its native peoples.
                The Newberry exhibition led to Lewis & Clark and the Indian
                        Country: The Native American Perspective. Using sources from the time
                    of the expedition and from the years that followed, as well as current essays
                    and interview transcripts, editors Frederick Hoxie and Jay Nelson present an
                    instructive account of Indian - 
                        United States
                     interaction from the expedition to the present, as well as of
                    Native American culture and affairs. Journal entries written by expedition
                    members about their encounters with the native peoples; Native American creation
                    myths and other stories; accounts of the impact of reservations, cattle herding,
                    and the damming of the Missouri upon Indian life; and narratives of efforts to save
                    such aspects of traditional culture as language, fishing, and crafts are just
                    some of the many subjects in this enlightening and interesting book. As
                    contributor James Ronda makes clear, both the Corps of Discovery and the native
                    peoples they encountered were explorers. Ronda's conclusion provides
                    some "sobering thoughts" on the Lewis and Clark story, the
                    bicentennial, and the lessons offered by both (pp. 343-52).
                
                        Indiana
                     played a significant part in the Lewis and Clark story. The first
                    person Meriwether Lewis tried to recruit for the journey was Indian trader and
                    interpreter John Conner of 
                        Indiana
                    . It was at the Falls of the Ohio, in Louisville and in neighboring
                    Clarksville, 
                        Indiana
                    , that William Clark recruited the foundation of the Corps of
                    Discovery, the famous "Nine Young Men from 
                        Kentucky
                    ," who, together with Clark's enslaved African
                    American York, were essential to the expedition's success. Expedition
                    reports and artifacts crossed 
                        Indiana
                     from 
                        Vincennes
                     to 
                        Clarksville
                     on their way eastward. 
                        Indiana
                     Territorial Governor William Henry Harrison corresponded with
                    Clark. The 
                        Vincennes
                    
                    Indiana Gazette reported news of the Corps' journey
                    that was reprinted in other newspapers. Lewis and Clark traveled across 
                        Indiana
                     on their way east in the fall of 1806, and some of the expedition
                    veterans settled in the territory.
                
                        Indiana
                     agencies, groups, and individuals took an active part in
                    commemorating the recent anniversary, and the state's Lewis and Clark
                    Bicentennial Foundation continues to support Lewis and Clark - related
                    programming. All in all, 
                        Indiana
                     has an important connection to this historic event in American
                    history and to the efforts to commemorate and learn from it. For Hoosiers as for
                    all Americans, Lewis and Clark's experiences in Indian country offer
                    much to be considered and learned from, today and for the future.

                Frontiers of FaithBringing Catholicism to the West in the
                        Early Republic By John R. Dichtl (
                        Lexington
                    : University Press of Kentucky, 2008. Pp. ix, 240. Notes,
                    bibliography, index. $50.00.)
                John Dichtl's study traces Catholic for- tunes in the trans-Appalachian
                    West - 
                        Kentucky
                    , the backcountry of 
                        Maryland
                     and 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , the southernmost portions of 
                        Ohio
                     and 
                        Indiana
                     - from the 1780s through the 1820s. The trans-Appalachian frontier
                    in these decades, he argues, was for Catholics a "contested
                    space" - a place where they encountered an almost bewildering variety
                    of Protestants on more or less equal terms. If Catholics were still a numerical
                    minority and handicapped by poverty, they could draw on the resources of a rich
                    devotional tradition that was rendered the more evocative by the circumstances
                    of frontier privation. They also enjoyed the services of some remarkable priests
                    - men who aspired to communal as well as religious leadership. As a result,
                    frontier Catholics, and especially their clergy, were more apt than their East
                    Coast confreres to be optimists with regard to the future of American
                    Catholicism and confident in their own standing as citizens.
                At the same time, frontier life posed serious obstacles to Catholicism's
                    flourishing. Even where they tried to settle together, Catholics in the
                    trans-Appalachian West almost invariably had Protestant neighbors. An acute
                    shortage of priests and money retarded the development of conventional parish
                    life. Frontier mobility undermined efforts to build community, while frontier
                    isolation increased the likelihood of religious intermarriage. Particularly in
                    the early years of settlement, moreover, that
                    same isolation made it hard for a distant bishop to discipline his priests,
                    which resulted in an unusually large number of clerical scandals in the region,
                    generally centered on money and factional infighting. Sexual scandals seem to
                    have been less common, at least according to the surviving record. But scandals
                    of any variety were damaging not just to Catholic morale but to prospects for
                    inter-religious harmony.
                Dichtl's narrative departs from most previous accounts of Catholicism in
                    the early Republic in its marked absence of triumphalism. Although he duly notes
                    the institution-building achievements of these decades, some of which were
                    impressive, he is far more interested in the encounter between Catholics and
                    non-Catholics. A rough sort of ecumenism does seem to have prevailed in the
                    early years of frontier settlement. Catholic schools were among the first
                    educational institutions to be established in the trans-Appalachian West and
                    were typically patronized by Protestants as well as Catholics. Protestants often
                    contributed to Catholic church-building funds, motivated partly by a hunger for
                    social stability and partly by boosterism. Catholic preaching of even the most
                    vigorously apologetic variety usually drew crowds, given the loneliness and
                    tedium of frontier existence, as did Catholic devotional processions. There were
                    occasional conversions, too, which figured prominently in period Catholic
                    mythology.
                In the 1820s, however, growing Catholic numbers and continued achievement on the
                    institutional front led to increasing religious polarization. For many
                    evangelical Protestants, Catholic success in the trans-Appalachian West - no
                    matter how modest its actual dimensions - threatened to erode the
                    nation's Protestant identity. By the 1830s, what Ray Allen Billington
                    has famously called "the Protestant crusade" was well
                    underway, stoked in subsequent years by greatly accelerated Catholic
                    immigration. American Catholics responded by turning inward, their lives more
                    and more defined by exclusively Catholic institutions and distinctive religious
                    practices derived from European devotional traditions.
                Dichtl is especially to be commended for exploring an under-researched period and
                    locale in American Catholic history. He has done a fine job of interrogating
                    sources that come mostly from clerical hands. I particularly admired his
                    analysis of Catholic material culture in a frontier context. His book is a
                    welcome addition to American Catholic historiography.

                The Arts and Architecture of German Settlements in 
                            Missouri
                         A Survey of a Vanishing Culture By Charles van

                    : University of Missouri Press, 2006. Pp. xxxvi, 539. Illustrations,
                    notes, bibliography, index. $79.95.)
                The University of Missouri Press is to be commended for republishing Charles van
                    Ravenswaay's magnum opus, an exhaustive and lavishly illustrated
                    catalog of folk art, objects, and architecture associated with German immigrants
                    who settled in 
                        Missouri
                     in the mid-nineteenth century. In doing so, the press has provided
                    another generation of readers with access to a true classic, a handsome volume
                    that belongs on the shelf of historians, folklorists, and Germanophiles, as well
                    as anyone concerned with German immigration to the 
                        U.S.
                     An informative and touching introduction by Adolf Shroeder, van
                    Ravenswaay's longtime acquaintance and a noted expert on German
                    settlements in 
                        Missouri
                    , is a welcome addition to this revised edition.
                    Schroeder's richly detailed biographical sketch does a fine job of
                    placing the work in context and provides the reader with an overview of the
                    author's life and accomplishments. Schroeder rightly credits the first
                    publication of van Ravenswaay's work in 1977 with a revival of interest
                    in German cultural traditions, festivals, history, and sister-city agreements in
                    the German-settled region of 
                        Missouri
                     in the 1980s.
                The book is divided into three parts. Part I, "The Great
                    Migration" (chapters 1-4), provides a contextual framework within which
                    to view the German immigration to 
                        Missouri
                     in the nineteenth century, based largely on a review of secondary
                    sources. Part II, "Buildings" (chapters 5-11), surveys extant
                    examples of folk architecture built by German immigrants who settled along the
                        Missouri River
                    between 
                        St.
                            Louis
                     and 
                        Jefferson
                            City
                    , the region with which the book is most concerned. This section of
                    the book is an exhaustive accounting of such artifacts, and includes hundreds of
                    photographs, sketches, and floor plans. While most such surveys are organized
                    according to architectural form and style, van Ravenswaay organizes this section
                    by construction material (log, frame, stone and brick), which unfortunately does
                    not as easily allow comparisons across time and space. Part III,
                    "Objects for Domestic Use" (chapters 12-23), surveys extant
                    examples of domestic objects such as furniture (cupboards, benches, pie safes,
                    tables, chairs, chests), musical instruments, baskets, firearms, textiles,
                    pottery, and drawings and prints that were either brought with the immigrants
                    from 
                        Germany
                     or made by German immigrants in 
                        Missouri
                    . This section is also stunningly comprehensive in scope and
                    likewise is accompanied by literally hundreds of photographs and drawings of
                    these objects.
                
                Academically, the book should be seen as a product of its time and judged by what
                    it is - a largely descriptive survey, massive in its scope and remarkable in its
                    attention to detail, that remains the most impressive record of the material
                    artifacts associated with nineteenth-century German immigrants - rather than by
                    what it is not. The book's main drawback is a lack of significant
                    context that ties the subject matter (folk culture artifacts) to any
                    national-scale patterns or processes. The work tells us very little about the
                    people who made or possessed these objects - class, social ideals, and
                    economies, for example, are concepts almost wholly outside of its purview. Much
                    of the author's discussion of the history of German immigration to 
                        Missouri
                     is unfortunately outdated and is preoccupied with the role of
                    various organized settlement ventures and societies. A plethora of highly
                    detailed studies of individual immigrant communities in the Midwest written in
                    the 1980s and 1990s, which traced immigrants back to sending regions in Europe,
                    have provided a much richer and fuller understanding of the nature of German
                    immigration in the nineteenth century, focusing on the role of chain migration
                    and the role of class in the trans-Atlantic migration. But in the end these
                    shortcomings distract little from the overall value of this stunning and
                    beautiful piece of scholarship. Viewed within the context of the
                    author's main goals (to catalog and survey folk artifacts) and of the
                    period in which it was written, it remains a true classic even thirty years
                    after its initial publication.

                    the American labor movement unable to articulate alternatives to a system that
                    continued to destroy communities, devastate the environment, and increase the
                    distance between the haves and the have-nots. So reads the usual academic
                    assessment of the state of American labor in the twenty-first century - a view
                    with roots that reach back to the supposedly lean, lost decades that surrounded
                    the First World War.
                Rosemary Feurer acknowledges the dim outlook for labor in the new millennium, but
                    she is not so pessimistic in her appraisal of when or how the trouble began. This is because she frames
                    her analysis more broadly than the traditional labor history of great leaders
                    stirring militancy on the shop floor to overcome the hegemony of large,
                    multi-plant corporations. Her view extends to "labor's
                    periphery," where a "militant minority endeavored to weld
                    their workmates and neighbors into a self-aware and purposeful working
                    class" (p. 236). This widened gaze - encompassing both workplace and
                    community - allows her to note the substantive social change that seemed
                    possible when workers confronted corporate power on the job and worked to
                    transform their local community and the nation.
                 Feurer labels this recognition of the union as both labor organization and civic
                    organization "radical unionism," and locates its embodiment in
                    District 8 of the United Electrical, Radio, and Machine Workers of America, a
                    cluster of local unions stretching across six midwestern states. Based in 
                        St.
                            Louis
                    , District 8 emerged in 1936 alongside a number of grassroots
                    organizations with Communist ties. Under the leadership of Communist William
                    Sentner, the 50,000 members of District 8 drew upon the city's rich
                    leftist labor heritage and combined it with a strong civic consciousness to
                    become "one of the most democratic organizations of working-class life
                    in the Midwest" (p. 223). Feurer carefully narrates the development of
                    Sentner's personal philosophy of "human rights above property
                    rights," (p. 72) and its evolution into a union philosophy to
                    "link workers' struggle with community-based
                    mobilizations" (p. 43). From his early 1930s experiences organizing
                    black female workers in 
                        St.
                            Louis's
                     nut-shelling sweatshops, Sentner recognized that community was
                    vital if a union was to act as a movement for social transformation. He and
                    other district organizers tapped into networks of communal support in a plan to
                    overcome anti-union bosses in electrical manufacturing plants in 
                        Illinois
                     and 
                        Iowa
                     (Emerson, Century, Wagner, and Maytag) and metal-trades firms in 
                        Indiana
                    , and also to improve other aspects of daily existence in 
                        St.
                            Louis
                    . They addressed housing issues, allied with clergy, challenged
                    racist cultural practices, confronted gender inequalities, and developed youth
                    programs. The multi-city, multi-firm comparative method that Feurer employs to
                    tell these stories reveals the importance of cross-plant solidarity - strikes at
                    some shops helped stimulate organizing in others - but also uncovers the ways in
                    which employers collaborated through locally based trade and civic associations
                    to combat the union threat - linking community success to collective bargaining
                    and employee-employer cooperation. Her examination of the subtle power of civic
                    anti-unionism to undermine worker solidarity adds another important chapter to
                    the story of the failure of the American labor movement in the 1940s.
                
                District 8 took a beating during the anticommunist offensive of that decade, and
                    collapsed completely by 1955, despite the strength of its radical unionism.
                    Nevertheless, District 8 is an important topic, Feurer concludes, because of its
                    considerable difference from mainstream unions: its commitment to civil rights,
                    its adherence to community-based organizing strategies, and its penchant for
                    eschewing collective bargaining and cooperation with employers in favor of shop
                    floor militancy. Although it disappeared - along with the rest of radical
                    American labor - its effort represents an important moment in labor history when
                    union activism and community organizing were fused by ordinary people who wanted
                    to participate in the decisions that shaped their lives. Feurer narrates that
                    moment - and captures its spirit - very well.

                Politician Extraordinaire The Tempestuous Life and Times of
                        Martin L. Davey By Frank P. Vazzano (

                    notes, bibliography, index. $45.00.)
                Frank Vazzano argues in this straight-forward, accessible, and competent
                    biography that Martin L. Davey, 
                        Ohio
                     congressman (1919-1921 and 1923-1929) and governor (1935-1939),
                    gave "friend and foe alike the political ride of their lives"
                    (p. 274). But the portrait Vazzano draws of the conservative politician suggests
                    that the ride was mostly downhill.
                Vazzano begins his survey of Davey's life with a look at his troubled
                    boyhood. His father, English immigrant John Davey, was a distant and stern
                    figure who invented the art of tree surgery, but the resulting family fortune
                    came too late to spare Martin from the typical trials of an impoverished
                    turn-of-the-century American household. Indeed, much about Davey's life
                    was typical. Later, as mayor of 
                        Kent
                    , 
                        Ohio
                    , he was a booster of the usual sort; as a congressman, his
                    combination of strong partisanship, populist instincts, and pro-business views
                    relegated him to the sidelines; and as governor, he cared more about reelection
                    than governing.
                As the book's title suggests, Davey was a better office-seeker than
                    officeholder. While a congressman, he preferred to skip votes and legislative
                    work to spend time with his family - and business - back in 
                        Ohio
                    . True, being a member of the minority party limited his scope of action, but it is telling
                    that his lone notable legislative success - securing funds for the construction
                    of the Navy dirigible Akron (duly named after the city in
                    Davey's congressional district) - ended in the 1933 loss of the blimp
                    and 73 men at sea. Davey's time as governor is equally devoid of
                    general interest. The only really noteworthy event of his time in 
                        Columbus
                     was a tiff with presidential adviser Harry Hopkins over the
                    organization of New Deal relief efforts, which Vazzano treats in detail. More
                    important to Davey and more interesting to the contemporary reader, however,
                    were the methods that Governor Davey used to keep his political machine well
                    lubricated with both private and public money. Only vetted Democrats could
                    realistically hope to hold a government job, and Davey, with his henchman
                    Francis Poulson, assessed as much as 5 percent of state employees'
                    salaries for their campaign coffers. There were also, of course, the usual side
                    payments and kickbacks associated with government purchasing and the
                    distribution of liquor licenses and similar privileges.
                In his conclusion, the sympathetic Vazzano excuses Davey's consistently
                    petulant responses to his critics, his unprincipled refusal to condemn the 1920s
                    Klan, and his use of public powers for private gain with the tepid admission
                    that the governor was "a bit of a scoundrel" (p. 274).
                    Scoundrel, though, is the wrong word. There was nothing charming or dashing
                    about the mature Davey, as there was about, say, Huey Long. Davey simply viewed
                    patronage and payouts as tools in the vote-winning game, not as ways to advance
                    the interests of the public at large or even of one class of the public.
                Accordingly, Vazzano's life of Davey, like William Pickett's
                    1990 biography of Homer Capehart, is a useful study of a fairly ordinary working
                    politician in twentieth-century 
                        America
                    . Davey's story may not be inspiring, but that is
                    unsurprising; most political careers are not. Examining the circumstances and
                    responses of everyday politicians is a useful way to understand politics, and
                    incidentally a useful corrective to both romanticized and demonized conceptions
                    of the political vocation. An exclusive focus on the Roosevelts, Lincolns, and
                    Kennedys tends to distort those realities and to overshadow the experiences of
                    vast majority of men and women in public life. After all, to paraphrase Roman
                    Hruska, the mediocre politicians are entitled to a little attention,
                    aren't they?

                Style and Status Selling Beauty to African American Women,
                        1920-1975 By Susannah Walker (
                        Lexington
                    : University Press of Kentucky, 2007. Pp. xiii, 250. Illustrations,
                    notes, bibliography, index. $40.00.)
                Susannah Walker's Style and Status makes a significant
                    contribution to the history of African American consumerism with particular
                    focus on women's beauty culture. The book, Walker's first,
                    explores the politics, practices, and processes of beauty culture to analyze how
                    "the interplay of race, class and gender . . . shaped power
                    relationships in the 
                        United States
                    " (p. 5). Focused on the years between 1920 and 1975,
                    Walker draws on a rich array of sources including the company records of Claude
                    A. Barnett and Madam C.J. Walker (the latter of which are housed at the Indiana
                    Historical Society). Walker also analyzes oral histories, print advertisements,
                    and text and visuals in black newspapers and magazines. In exploring multiple
                    aspects of African American beauty culture, Walker not only draws on pioneering
                    scholarship in the field, but also builds upon Maxine Craig's recent
                    examination of beauty pageants (Ain't I a Beauty
                        Queen?, 2002) and upon my work on the black modeling industry. Mining
                    these primary and secondary sources allows Walker to trace entrepreneurship,
                    consumption, and identity formation to understand the shifting place of beauty
                    in defining urban African Americans' gendered identities.
                In tracing the glory and decline of black-owned beauty businesses, Walker
                    incisively analyses the paradoxical consequences of white corporate efforts to
                    lure the "New Negro market." Framing this discussion in the
                    trope of "consumer citizenship" - most notably defined by
                    Roland Marchand - Walker shows how black advocacy for white marketing to African
                    Americans proved a double-edged sword. By the late 1940s, white businesses
                    increasingly targeted African Americans as important "new"
                    consumers, yet this validation - long-desired by those like Barnett - undercut
                    the viability of black-owned business. With limited resources, the
                    long-established African American beauty business declined, along with
                    consumerist beauty ideals specified and negotiated by black communities. Walker
                    demonstrates how white advertisers in the 1970s commodified the Afro into a
                    trendy hairstyle, extricating the radical hairdo from its politicized meaning.
                    Walker's analysis of the Afro as a gendered, classed, and even
                    temporary fashion (through wig design), facilitates her argument for an
                    increasing disconnect between consumer-based visions of black female beauty and
                    those constructed and contested by divergent groups of African Americans.
                Walker offers an engaging narrative of changing market and consumer practices, although she might have focused more
                    attention on some matters. For example, Walker writes that shifting consumption
                    patterns during the 1940s diminished interactions between women. As women
                    shopped more often in drug and grocery stores, their personal connections with
                    door-to-door beauty agents - characteristic of commercial beauty culture in the
                    first decades of the twentieth century - declined. This shift deserves greater
                    consideration by looking more closely at beauty-product shopping as a
                    woman-centered activity. In lieu of the beauty agent, did women accompany and
                    advise each other, or did shopping for cosmetics become as banal as shopping for
                    milk? Was this an intergenerational experience? Did the developing youth culture
                    of these decades view this as a bonding activity or an act of rebellion?
                    Exploration of gendered beauty purchasing could provide further insight into the
                    social, economic and age-specific aspects of consumption.
                In other places, Walker develops the classed aspects of women's social
                    interactions. Noteworthy is her discussion of mega-beauty salons. Here, Walker
                    shows how women of all economic classes could afford - if only infrequently - a
                    trip to the beauty salon, where pampering and hair care proved a welcome escape
                    from drudge work for white employers. In recasting the beauty salon from social
                    space to one of upscale leisure, Walker shows that upper-end salons like Cardozo
                    in 
                        Washington, D.C.
                    , implemented new measures such as appointment-keeping and a
                    "no-gossip" policy. Questioning the effectiveness of these
                    regulations, Walker portrays salons as woman-centered spaces where beauty was
                    not always the only, or even primary, concern. Overall, Style and
                        Status offers important contributions to several fields of historical
                    inquiry.

                    half-dozen major prizes, including the Organization of American
                    Historians' Frederick Jackson
                    Turner Award. Deservedly praised as ambitious and innovative, Impossible Subjects examines the creation of the legal categories and
                    bureaucratic mechanisms that distinguished "citizens" from
                    "aliens" - integral members of the national polity from
                    "subjects" living at its margins.
                The book retraces the evolution of national laws, rulings, policies, and
                    structures from the 1924 Johnson-Reed Act, known for its restrictive national
                    quotas, to the more permissive 1965 Hart-Celler Act. Historians have pointed to
                    Hart-Celler as one of the foremost achievements of post-war liberalism. The law
                    dispensed with racial and national preferences, something President Lyndon B.
                    Johnson called "a deep and painful flaw in the fabric of American
                    justice," and it opened the nation's doors to increasing
                    numbers of immigrants from Latin America, Africa, and Asia (p. 259).
                Ngai, however, skillfully reveals the central paradox of the 1965 act: founded in
                    "the principle of formal equality" and a valorization of
                    cultural pluralism, Hart-Celler actually "comprised a complex of
                    measures that promoted both greater inclusions and greater exclusions"
                    (p. 263). While the act banished old annual immigration quotas, it also imposed
                    new ones: 120,000 for the Western hemisphere; 170,000 for the Eastern hemisphere
                    (encompassing Europe, Asia, and Africa); 20,000 for any given country in the
                    Eastern hemi- sphere-a cap eventually extended to the Western hemisphere. This
                    new regime, though egalitarian in principle, failed to consider pressing
                    realities, including the historic permeability of borders and the large presence
                    of - and growing demand for - Mexican laborers. Consequently, hundreds of
                    thousands of "illegal" Mexicans were deported, and millions
                    more remained in the shadows of the body politic. Hart-Celler effectively
                    codified equality and pluralism at the expense of equity and practicability.
                The paradox of Hart-Celler makes sense in light of earlier reforms and policies,
                    which Ngai masterfully details in preceding chapters, drawing on previously
                    unexamined records of the 
                        U.S.
                     Immigration and Naturalization Service. In the years leading to and
                    following the Johnson Reed Act, politicians invoked "national
                    sovereignty" in seeking greater control over the nation's
                    gateways to stem the tide of "undesirable" Southern and
                    Eastern Europeans. That law introduced the first numerical restrictions (Chinese
                    exclusion notwithstanding) based on national origin, and in turn
                    "created a new class of persons within the national polity - illegal
                    aliens - whose inclusion in the nation was at once a social reality and a legal
                    impossibility" (p. 57). Johnson-Reed also inaugurated a period of
                    deportations, which had the unintended consequence of dramatically increasing
                    illegal migration from exempted countries of the Western Hemisphere, most notably 
                        Mexico
                    . This, in turn, drew attention to the nation's porous
                    borders and, Ngai contends, "rearticulated the 
                        U.S.
                     - 
                        Mexico
                     border as a cultural and racial boundary, a creator of illegal
                    immigration" (p. 67).
                The four decades framed by Johnson-Reed and Hart-Celler saw the fortification of
                    physical, legal, and racial boundaries separating Mexican, Filipino, Japanese,
                    and Chinese residents from the white body politic. Their systematic
                    racialization, juridical exclusion, or conditional admission into the national
                    polity occupies the middle chapters of Ngai's painstaking work.
                In spite of the book's breadth, Impossible Subjects
                    leaves us longing to know more about other American imperial subjects who
                    resided in and moved about the American territories. It is hard to imagine
                    future comparative studies about "alien citizens" that do not
                    expand on Puerto Ricans' 
                        U.S.
                     citizenship (granted in 1917), which in many respects goes to the
                    heart of Ngai's questions about human movement, race, and the American
                    polity. A vast and growing body of scholarship in 
                        U.S.
                     immigration history and ethnic studies has enriched our
                    understanding of race, ethnicity, and nation. This book splendidly bridges and
                    builds on that scholarship.

                    effort to "capture unsung historical treasures on film." After the Harvest covers the interiors and exteriors of dozens
                    of grain elevators and feed mills. Some are represented by one or two
                    photographs and a simple identifying caption. Others, such as

                    textual accompaniment. Silent Workplace ranges more widely,
                    picturing workplaces such as stores, barber shops, garages, and banks. The
                    historic importance of manufacturing to 
                        Indiana's
                     economy is shown in Bower's many photographs of buildings
                    where furniture, sewing machines, bricks, beer, milk, and limestone, among other
                    products, were created or processed. Bower's photographs may prompt
                    readers to consider the buildings that are disappearing or already lost along
                    their own country lanes, and in their small towns and cities.

                    women who served in the war. As a member of the Women's Army Corps
                    during 1944 and 1945, the 
                        Danville

                    Collected here, the letters, photographs, and personal sketches she wrote and
                    compiled over that time open a fascinating ground-level window on the history of
                    the conflict. Brown adds to that view, however, placing her wartime words in
                    wider historical context by providing concise, informative introductions and
                    explanations throughout. As a result, this work should find a home on the
                    bookshelves of scholars, history buffs, and anyone interested in the array of
                    personal experiences of Americans during World War II.

                    history of how this rural county became home to so many artists. The producer
                    uses period photographs and paintings by fifteen of the "core"
                    artists of the colony, including Adolph and Ada Shulz, T. C. Steele, and Gustave
                    Baumann. The film sketches the rise of the art colony, its gradual decline
                    through the 1950s and 1960s, the subsequent rise of the county as a tourist
                    attraction, and the rediscovery of the artists in the 1970s and 1980s.

                    Paperbound, $24.95.) Anyone who doubts that poetry can reveal the history
                    of a person or a place should read the collected poems of 
                        Indiana
                     poet laureate Norbert Krapf. Almost 200 poems, written over a
                    35-year period, speak to growing up among the small towns and farms of the
                    Hoosier countryside. Krapf imagines the experiences of a wide variety of
                    Hoosiers, including the first white pioneers arriving in the forests of 
                        Indiana
                     territory, a Civil War veteran, and a fan who dreams of becoming
                    Peyton Manning's receiver. David Pierini's evocative
                    photographs illustrate many of the poems.

                    their childhood and religious upbringing (if any); the variety of their work as
                    monks (including teaching, tending the abbey vineyard and winery, working the
                    abbey farm, acting as a librarian, and working for the Abbey Press); the
                    influences of Vatican II and subsequent church reforms; and the changing and
                    unchanging aspects of monastic life. Anyone interested in the contemporary
                    history of American Catholicism and of monastic movements will be interested by

                The Farmers' Market Book Growing Food, Cultivating

                    particular atmosphere of a local farmers' market - buying local produce
                    on a warm summer morning or a cold autumn day - will appreciate this work.
                    Trying to capture and explain that atmosphere, the authors have also expanded
                    upon the history of and the need for such community-based markets. Focusing on

                    , they relay anecdotes, accompanied by photographs, of veteran
                    market-goers and emphasize the sense of family shared by consumers and
                    producers.
                Fighting for Equality A Life of May Wright Sewall By

                    : Indiana Historical Society Press, 2007. Pp. 160. Illustrations,
                    bibliography, index. $17.95.) Part of the growing IHS biographical series
                    for young readers, this volume examines the life of Hoosier temperance and
                    suffrage reformer May Wright Sewall. Sewall is profiled here from her early age
                    through the decades of her public work. Through Sewall's life, young
                    readers will learn about nineteenth-century middle- and upper-class women -
                    their clubs, their benevolent and reform associations, their prospects for
                    education, and the fight by some for the right to vote. Sewall's life
                    story also sheds light on the peace movement during World War I and on the
                    American fascination with spiritualism, a practice to which Sewall turned in her
                    late life. The book is extensively illustrated and concludes with suggestions
                    for further research.
                
                Going Over All the Hurdles A Life of Oatess Archey By
                    John A. Beineke (
                        Indianapolis
                    : Indiana Historical Society, 2008. Pp. x, 137. Illustrations,
                    bibliography, index. $17.95.) John Beineke's portrait of Oatess
                    Archey-Marion, 
                        Indiana's
                     first African American sheriff - is an inspiring and entertaining
                    read. In this installment of the IHS's young reader biography series,
                    Archey overcomes discrimination to become a state high school champion in track,
                    an FBI agent, a teacher, and finally a sheriff. In a time when society would
                    have restricted him, Archey conquered obstacles by the virtue of perseverance.

                    $39.95.) The editor and publisher have culled several photographic archives
                    to amass this collection showing the places and people in

                            Wayne's
                     history. Like many urban photographic histories, the book contains
                    a large number of street scenes and views of various types of buildings. But it
                    also depicts all kinds of people - from 1860s firemen to an 1890s bicycle club
                    of young men to costumed participants in a 1976 Johnny Appleseed festival.
                    Citizens are shown at work, in parades, at baseball games, and in community
                    groups, such as the 1916 YWCA and a 1936 class at the Phyllis Wheatley Social
                    Center. Photographs portray the city during both world wars, with canning drives
                    and troop parades during World War I, and bond and scrap metal drives during
                    World War II. The editor has highlighted the importance of

                    from an 1866 photograph of a steamship on the White River to a 1960s skyview of Christmas lights on
                    Monument Circle. His selection of photographs includes the usual street scenes
                    and well-known buildings, but also encompasses many interesting interior shots,
                    including an early twentieth-century vaudeville production at the Empire
                    Theater; waitresses in the Ayres Tea Room in 1905; women workers packing
                    vaccines at Eli Lilly in 1919; families sending troops off to World War I from
                    Union Station; children playing at a
                    Lutheran orphans' home; and other scenes of everyday life. Photographs
                    of child laborers, including a group shot of dozens of tiny newsboys, and a 1908
                    photo of cannery employees remind readers of the long history of child labor.
                    One oversight in this otherwise varied collection is that only two photographs
                    present the city's African American community.

                    . Covering the period from the establishment of the new state

                    first car race at the end of the nineteenth century, the two-section video looks
                    at historic events, as well as the city's economic growth and social
                    prosperity. In sixty minutes, the viewer becomes acquainted with the historical
                    roots that make the city what it is today.

                    When one picks up an autobiography written by a member of the creative team that
                    steered one of the funniest television comedies of the twentieth century, one
                    expects a laugh or two, to say the least. What might not be expected are the
                    colorful insights, the historical facts, and the satirical quips that also come
                    in this easy-to-read book. Davis, an 
                        Indianapolis
                     native and IU School of Journalism graduate, describes how her
                    friends, family, and everyday life became inspiration for the "I Love
                    Lucy" scripts that she wrote for twenty years.

                    Bloomington are aware of the striking I. M. Pei-designed building that houses
                    the university's art museum. Many, however, remain unaware of the art
                    treasures that lie within. The book begins with a history of the collection,
                    primarily a tribute to the work and the discernment of former art department
                    chair Henry Hope and museum director Thomas Solley. Chapters - organized by
                    geographic area with text and captions by museum curators - survey the
                    museum's collections from Africa; ancient

                    , introduced by the town's mayor, includes a brief historical
                    introduction to each chapter and informative captions. Photographs cover
                    important buildings, events, and people - at work, at the barbershop, at the
                    city swimming pool, attending school. Two late chapters focus on the devastation
                    left behind by a 1974 tornado and on the history of a popular summer resort,
                    Indiana Beach. The Aurora Farmers Fair covers the history of
                    the fair in five chapters. The period from the 1950s onward is over-represented,
                    and photographs of floats and queens begin to look the same from year to year,
                    but readers will still enjoy this glimpse into small-town life.

                    of its seven chapters to the first half of the twentieth century, when several
                    local health sanitariums operated around the town's mineral spring.
                    Photos of guests lounging on green lawns, and of the luxurious dining rooms and
                    bathing rooms, recapture a lost era in the town's history.

                    bibliography, index. $29.95.) This handsome and informative book is the
                    product of a collaboration between author John Sherman and
                    photographer/interviewer Jeffrey A. Wolin. Comprising a collection of individual
                    portraits of recent central

                     immigrants - both photographic and written - and bookended by

                        Indiana
                    , the book offers an enjoyable read. More importantly, however, the
                    ground-level perspectives and immigration discussion that the authors present
                    should urge readers to think about twenty-first century
                    "globalism" as it plays out in the Hoosier state.

                    authors set out to prove that no single entity can be identified as
                    "the Amish." Using interviews, fieldwork, and an extensive
                    bibliography of sources, they have produced an in-depth study of the twenty
                    Amish settlements in the state of 
                        Indiana
                    , from northeastern

                            County

                    migration, ordnung (a "way of ordering
                    life"), ethnicity, and cultural context. Through histories,
                    contemporary stories, detailed maps and tables, and photographs, the authors
                    paint a portrait of what they call "diverse Amish worlds"
                    within a single tradition.
                Spinning Through Clouds Tales from an Early Hoosier

                    Illustrations, bibliography, index. Paperbound, $19.95.) This book
                    introduces young adult readers to the adventure (and danger) of early aviation
                    in 
                        Indiana
                    . Author Knight began flying in 1936 at the age of ten, when his
                    father created a dirt strip airport on his farm near Lynn and purchased a
                    biplane. Many of 
                        Indiana's
                     aviation pioneers stopped by the Knight airstrip, sharing their
                    skills with young Max. He took all of this information and encouragement to
                    heart, embracing flying as a hobby - one that lasted almost 45 years. In Spinning Through Clouds, Knight relates his personal flight
                    experiences and places them in the context of American general and commercial
                    aviation history.

                    Foster's Studebaker: The Complete History provides an
                    interesting, comprehensive look into the venerable manufacturing company and its
                    prod- ucts. Running the gamut from Studebaker's early days as a wagon
                    manufacturer and closing with the final chapter of the company's
                    existence in 1970, Foster's work is driven by a wealth of interesting
                    stories, lush photographs, and an attention to detail that bring the company and
                    its cars back to life.

                     quilts, this volume looks at more than two dozen distinctive and
                    stunningly beautiful album quilts, all produced within a relatively small area
                    in the state's southwestern Miami River valley from the 1880s through
                    the 1910s. The author's research enabled her to locate the family
                    history of many of the quilts' early owners. The book details their
                    lives and these unique quilts.

                    notes, bibliography, index. $65.00.) Although the 11th Corps of the Army of
                    the Potomac in May 1863 had relatively few midwestern soldiers, any reader
                    interested in the history of ethnic troops, in particular German American
                    troops, in the Civil War should read this volume. Keller, using heretofore
                    unused German-language source, argues that the Battle of Chancellorsville, one
                    of the Confederacy's greatest victories, became "the key event
                    of the nineteenth century for the nation's largest ethnicity"
                    (p. 9). The author begins by setting German Americans within the context of
                    1850s nativism. He then looks at German Americans in the Union ranks before
                    Chancellorsville; offers a detailed chapter on the battle itself and on the
                    conduct of the Union's 11th Corps when confronted by the clearly
                    superior forces of Stonewall Jackson; studies how the "overall
                    morale" of the Northern Army and civilians was restored after the
                    battle "at the expense of" German soldiers; reads the German
                    American community's reaction in newspapers and family correspondence;
                    and finally considers how the memory of Chancellorsville affected German
                    American assimilation for the rest of the nineteenth century.

                    Paperbound, $21.99.) This update of a 1984 book chronicles the history of
                    Protestant colleges in the 
                        United States
                    . The author has added a chapter on the growth of such colleges in
                    the last two-plus decades, as well as a new epilogue, and church historian Mark
                    Noll has written a new introduction.

                    notes, bibliography, index. $34.95.) Brakebill reconstructs and interprets
                    the life of Celestia Rice Colby through her private journals and published
                    writings. Born in 
                        Ohio
                     in 1827, Colby spent her life as part of the rural midwestern
                    middle class, marrying in 1848 and bearing five children. Although she lived her
                    life in the traditional sphere of the home, Colby's writings, which
                    increasingly focused on the equal status of men and women, advocated an
                    alternate, future reality.

                    $19.95.) Intended as a "concise, readable, and affordable
                    introductory history," the book is divided into twelve chapters, with
                    the chronological and the topical (including government, education, and the
                    arts) interspersed. Adapted from a textbook, the volume retains sentence
                    structure and vocabulary that make it suitable for classroom use and for easy
                    general reading. The book also includes a generous helping of maps,
                    illustrations, topical sidebars, and appendices, as well as a scant
                    bibliography.

                    , the essayists collected in this volume consider fifteen
                    historically Quaker colleges and universities, spread from the East to the West
                    coasts. Hoosier readers will be particularly interested in Hamm's
                    chapter on Earlham College.

                    notes, bibliography, index. $24.95.) Baseball historian Peter
                    Morris's lively and engaging book works on a variety of levels. Morris
                    explores the lives and work of brothers Tom and Jack Murphy, professional
                    baseball groundskeepers at the turn of the twentieth century. Morris offers an interesting ground-level perspective on an
                    under-explored strata of the early days of professional baseball. Through the
                    course of his book, however, Morris simultaneously throws an interesting light
                    on larger historical issues as diverse as the closing frontier, increasing
                    urbanization, changing national identity, immigrants and immigration, and the
                    importance of landscape, space, and place to American culture. Thoroughly
                    researched and footnoted with an impressive display of primary and secondary
                    sources, and accompanied by a solid bibliography, Level Playing
                        Fields is a definite hit.

                    , where he worked for the Arkansas Democrat during
                    the years 1957 to 1960. Counts photographed the tense and violent beginnings of
                    the desegregation of the

                    also includes introductory historical essays, and Counts's detailed
                    accounts of the events of those days and of his 1997 return to Little Rock

                        Indiana
                     regiments figure in a chapter on Cold Harbor during June 1864.
                    Those who visit historic battlefields with an interest in the design and
                    construction of field fortifications should take along a copy of the
                    author's appendix, a detailed examination - with diagrams - of several
                    sites.

                Thomas M. Spencer's review of Carl E. Kramer's This Place We Call Home: A History of 
                            Clark

                            Indiana
                        , which appeared in the December 2008 IMH, attributes 
                        Clark
                            County's
                     name to "William Rogers Clark." The
                    county's true namesake, as IMH readers will recognize
                    and as Kramer's book makes clear, is George Rogers Clark. The editors
                    apologize for the error.
                We erroneously described Dr. Elsie Meyers's memoir - a portion of which
                    appeared in the December 2008 issue - as "self-published." It
                    is as yet unpublished. Dr. Frank Forry, referenced in the article as a histology
                    and neuroanatomy teacher, was a pathologist and should have been identified
                    accordingly.
                Marjorie Randon Hershey's article, "The Whole World was
                    Watching ... Again," which also appeared in our December issue,
                    contained a factual error that was not of the author's making: the
                    correct date of Lyndon Johnson's announced withdrawal, as Dr. Hershey
                    points out, was March 31, not "March 3," 1968.
