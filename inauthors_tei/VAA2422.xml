                                          that morning, as he should have done, he never would have

                                          He didn&apos;t work for three days.&quot;</p>
                                   <p>There was a sound of suppressed laughter in the corner. The

                                          the chair and saw the colored boy at work, throbbing with
                                          exertion.</p>
                                   <p>&quot;Brush!&quot; shouted the barber, but the
                                          customer did not wait for the ceremonial. He ran for his
                                          car, and all the way home he leaned back in a warm reverie
                                          and helped the boy spend the million.</p>

                                   <p>Without confessing to himself that he remembered the first
                                          visit, he went to the shop one morning to have his shoes
                                          cleaned. The first conversation was the mere commonplace
                                          which passes between the employer and the employed. It
                                          related to the kind of polish to be used. Pink saw before
                                          him only pair of shoes. He little suspectedbut there is no
                                          need of anticipating.</p>
                                   <p>The customer sat in an arm-chair which was placed on top of a
                                          box-like rostrum. The box and the chair were studded with
                                          brass tacks and other metal ornaments. They would have
                                          served as a Congo throne. William Pinckney <pb
                                                 id="VAA2422-018" n="10"/> Marsh usually had the
                                          market page of yesterday&apos;s paper tucked under the
                                          chair cushion.</p>
                                   <p>Pink&apos;s shirt was a black and white study of
                                          trellises, with vines climbing up them.</p>
                                   <p>The vest was double-breasted, and had been once polka-dot
                                          silk, but now the dots were mostly blurred away and the
                                          pockets had begun to ravel.</p>
                                   <p>His trousers were black and brown check, worn thin at the
                                          knees and ragged at the bottom.</p>
                                   <p>The shoes were extremely pointed, two sizes too large, cracked
                                          across the top and protuberant at the heel.</p>
                                   <p>When Pink was dressed for the street he wore also a
                                          double-breasted coat tightly buttoned, a spreading blue
                                          necktie that had been handled once or twice too often, a
                                          high white collar and a light brown hat with a high crown.
                                          Pink improved as you studied him from the ground
                                          upward.</p>

                                   <p>What need to tell of the coal-black face, the broad-flanged
                                          nose, the elastic mouth opening on teeth of pearly
                                          whiteness, and the close growth of kinky hair?</p>
                                   <p>A song of passing popularity tells that all members of the
                                          Ethiopian division &quot;look alike.&quot; Pink
                                          was one of a thousand that is, so far as mere appearance
                                          was concerned.</p>
                                   <p>When it came to a consideration of the higher beingthe
                                          sure-enough egoPink was different. He saw things from his
                                          own standpoint, and there was room for no one else on his
                                          pedestal.</p>
                                   <p>On this first morning he came to his <pb id="VAA2422-020"
                                                 n="12"/> task languidly, and even lazily. After
                                          some sleepy preparations, he drew a heavy sigh and
                                          attacked the shoes fiercely. It will never be known
                                          whether Pink was a tired mortal driven to work, or an
                                          industrious mortal who had to restrain him-self by certain
                                          affectations.</p>
                                   <p>He was at his best when he walked. He allowed his feet to
                                          shuffle so that the movement was a sort of slow
                                          dance-step.</p>
                                   <p>He seemed to be keeping time to music which only the rapt and
                                          colored soul may hear.</p>
                                   <p>The morning customer learned in two or three visits that the
                                          barbers liked Pink and pitied him. They were men who had
                                          given much study to public questions. Pink came in on
                                          their back-and-forth discussions. He pieced in
                                          observations which amused them, and also convinced them
                                          that Pink lacked seriousness of purpose. They regarded him
                                          as a sort of court jester. Sometimes they patronized <pb

                                          they never forgot that there was a social chasm between a
                                          barber and a &quot;brush.&quot;</p>
                                   <p>Perhaps Pink did not fully understand the significance of
                                          their manner toward him, or he would have been cast down
                                          in spirit. As it was, the humility which he made his main
                                          stock in trade, was merely an outward pretense.</p>
                                   <p>The morning customer learned this on the occasion of his third
                                          visit, up to which time the conversation had been along
                                          the lines of rather strict formality. At the second visit
                                          he crossed Pink&apos;s palm with silver, so that when
                                          he came the third time he saw a mellow smile in the
                                          corner. The barbers were talking on the relations of
                                          Church and State that morning.</p>
                                   <p>The morning customer appeared to be amiable and receptive when
                                          Pink looked up at him.</p>

                                   <p>Pink folded the drying-cloth and went at the shoe again,
                                          singing softly:</p>

                                   <head>On the Proper Observance of<lb/> Christmas</head>
                                   <p>The holiday season was at hand the next time the morning
                                          customer went to the shop. As he climbed into the chair he
                                          saw on the wall, within easy reach, a pasteboard box
                                          capped with a sprig of green. In the side of the box was a
                                          slit large enough to receive a silver dollar. Below it
                                          were the words: &quot;Merry Xmas. Remeber the
                                          porter.&quot;</p>
                                   <p>&quot; What does that mean&apos;Merry
                                          Xmas&apos;?&quot; asked the customer.</p>
                                   <p>Pink shook his head slowly. &quot;You know mighty well
                                          what &apos;at means, misteh. If I on&apos;y had

                                   <p>&quot;That &apos;s a funny way to spell Christmas.
                                          What does the rest of it mean thereabout remembering the
                                          porter?&quot;</p>

                                   <p>&quot;Ask for what?&quot;</p>
                                   <p>Pink emitted a series of heaving sounds to indicate that he
                                          was amused.</p>
                                   <p>&quot; Mr. Clifford did a very fine job there,&quot;

                                   <p>Pink worked a few minutes and allowed the definition to
                                          percolate. Then he oh-served with a sigh: &quot;I
                                          could n&apos; ketch &apos;em boys not&apos;ith

                                   <p>The barber at chair No. I shouted &quot;Brush!&quot;
                                          and Pink shuffled away to attend to a thin man with a
                                          powdered complexion and gummy hair.</p>
                                   <p>First he brushed the thin man, front and hack, becoming more
                                          earnest in his efforts just as the man received a handful
                                          of small change. Pink held the overcoat, and after the
                                          thin man had worked into it, he reached under for the
                                          inside coat and <pb id="VAA2422-032" n="21"/> pulled it
                                          down so violently that the thin man was bowed backward.
                                          While Pink was brushing the overcoat the thin man walked
                                          over and took his hat from the hook.</p>
                                   <p>But he was not to escape so easily. Pink gently pulled the hat
                                          away from him and went in search of the small brush. He
                                          stood in front of the thin customer, and, holding the hat
                                          gingerly in the left hand, brushed it carefully, at the
                                          same time blowing off imaginary specks of dust.</p>
                                   <p>While the thin man was waiting for his hat he casually put his
                                          right hand into the trousers pocket. Pink stopped brushing
                                          and scratched at an invisible spot or stain of some sort
                                          on the sleeve of the overcoat.</p>
                                   <p>&quot;Shine?&quot; he inquired softly.</p>
                                   <p>&quot;Nope.&quot;</p>
                                   <p>He continued to brush the hat.</p>
                                   <p>The thin man withdrew his hand from the pocket. Pink turned
                                          the hat around right side forward and presented it to the
                                                 <pb id="VAA2422-033" n="22"/> customer with a bow.
                                          The customer&apos;s right hand moved forward a few
                                          inches, but Pink&apos;s broad palm met it more than
                                          half-way. The nickel passed.</p>
                                   <p>&quot;Thank you, seh,&quot; said Pink in a reverential
                                          whisper. The thin man started toward the door. Pink seized
                                          the long whisk-broom and pursued him, hitting him between
                                          the shoulder-blades. As the man passed out Pink got in one
                                          final blow on the coat-tails.</p>
                                   <p>&quot;You&apos;re doing well to-day,&quot;
                                          observed the morning customer when Pink had re-turned to
                                          his place in the corner.</p>
                                   <p>Pink dropped the nickel to the floor, as if by accident. Then
                                          he picked it up, turned it over and put it in his
                                          mouth.</p>
                                   <p>&quot;Money layin&apos; all&apos;roun&apos;

                                          his teeth.</p>

                                          on a diet of long words. He could not determine whether
                                          Pink&apos;s admiration for these words was real or
                                          feigned, and it mattered little so long as the boy
                                          pretended to be in ecstasy.</p>
                                   <p>One day, toward the close of the holiday season, the morning

                                          affairs. This was really the beginning of his term as

                                          locked in an earnest debate with Mr. Clifford. The barber
                                          was &quot;honing&quot; a razor and debating with
                                          careless case, as one who knew and scorned the full
                                          resources of his opponent. Pink had an ominous forefinger
                                          in the air and was contending for something or other in
                                          relation to civil rights.</p>

                                   <p>Pink laughed aloud, and then said: &quot;O, no, seh,

                                   <p>Pink leaned over the shoe and brushed with great energy, but
                                          said nothing. The customer heard sounds similar to those
                                          made by a loose steam-valve, and upon looking down he saw
                                          that Pink was smothering with laughter, which he was
                                          trying to hold in. This kind of mirth is contagious. The

                                          cogitate with exactitude I would say that it refers rather
                                          to a fanciful invention. Of course, you understand, Pink,
                                          that there are many terms allied in paraphristic
                                          connection which are essentiallyahdissimilar when it comes
                                          right down to it. Have you got change for a quarter?
                                          Thanks. Well, I must meander toward my destination.
                                          That&apos;s a good shine you gave me. I hope you will

                                          customer decided to be infallible. He learned that Pink
                                          came to him with full trust, and he believed it the better
                                          plan to answer all questions. So he found it his task to
                                          settle the problems relating to life and the after-life.
                                          Such a task would have been difficult but for the fact
                                          that Pink hung upon his words in simple faith and was not
                                          disposed to cross-question. One morning the subject matter

                                          morning customer. &quot;If Mr. Clifford says that the

                                   <p>&quot;I believe it is defined as a change, by continuous
                                          differentiation and integration, from a simple homogeneity
                                          to a complex heterogeneity, or something like
                                          that.&quot;</p>

                                   <p>The morning customer lifted the newspaper to conceal his grin
                                          of self-satisfaction, and Pink labored at the shoe,
                                          occasionally shaking his head and whispering to
                                          himself.</p>
                                   <p>Finally he looked up and said, &quot;I tol&apos;

                                   <p>&quot;That&apos;s right. We all descended from
                                          Adam.&quot;</p>
                                   <p>&quot;Yes, seh, an&apos; Misteh Cliffo&apos;d ask

                                   <pb id="VAA2422-090" n="71"/>
                                   <p>&quot;Why, that&apos;s easy enough. We were all white
                                          once, but some of the people went down into Africa just
                                          after the flood, and it was so hot down there that they
                                          became tanned.&quot;</p>
                                   <p>&quot;You call &apos;at tan?&quot; asked Pink,
                                          thoughtfully looking at his knuckles, which resembled a
                                          row of chocolate creams. &quot;No, seh, misteh,

                                   <p>&quot;Neveh you mind,&quot; returned Pink,

                                          him. Then he asked: &quot;Where is the boy who was
                                          here last week?&quot;</p>
                                   <p>&quot;I dunno.&quot;</p>
                                   <p>&quot;Is he sick?&quot;</p>

                                   <p>The new boy looked up sleepily and made no response. He toiled
                                          patiently, but the shine which he imparted was nothing
                                          more than a dull, metallic burnish.</p>
                                   <p>The morning customer passed upon him and decided that he was
                                          tired, wobbly, and uninteresting.</p>
                                   <p>And where was Pink?</p>
                                   <p>Mr. Clifford was not at the shop, so the morning customer
                                          applied to Mr. Adams for information. Mr. Adams, who was
                                          chewing gum and looking at a colored weekly, did not
                                          trouble himself to look up when the question was addressed
                                          to him. He smiled in fixed admiration at a noisy cartoon
                                          and said, &quot;The old man let him go.&quot;</p>
                                   <p>The morning customer went back to his office feeling that a
                                          part of his morning had been wasted.</p>
                                   <p>It was about two o&apos;clock in the afternoon <pb

                                          to the door and said, &quot;Colored feller wants to
                                          see you.&quot;</p>
                                   <p>&quot;A colored fellow? Who is he? What does he want to
                                          see me about?&quot;</p>
                                   <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know. He &apos;s got one hand
                                          wrapped up.&quot;</p>

                                          doorway. His overcoat collar was turned up, and one of his
                                          hands was bound up in a rude bandage, which was fastened
                                          with a large safety-pin. He had a sorrowful gaze. His
                                          eyeballs were threaded and bloodshot.</p>
                                   <p>The morning customer repressed an unfeeling inclination to
                                          laugh. He put himself on his dignity and asked:
                                          &quot;O, it&apos;s you, is it, Pink?&quot;</p>

                                          spirit, and gave a gusty sigh.</p>
                                   <p>&quot;What &apos;s this I hear about you losing your

                                          came in from the outer room with a book in her hand.</p>
                                   <p>&quot;Take this,&quot; said he, and after the young
                                          woman had seated herself he dictated as follows:</p>
                                   <p>M<hi rend="sc">R</hi>. C<hi rend="sc">LIFFORD</hi>Dear Sir:

                                          Your petitioner beseeches you from a contrite heart to
                                          forgive and forget his recent wandering from the straight
                                          and narrow path. He admits that, as a result of
                                          circumstances which cannot be set forth in this
                                          connection, he partook too freely of alcoholic stimulants,
                                          and thereby rendered himself incapable of appearing at
                                          your establishment at <pb id="VAA2422-111" n="88"/> the
                                          customary hour to assume the duties allotted to him. Mr.
                                          Clifford, remember what the poet says: &quot;Judge
                                          not, but rather in your heart let gentle pity
                                          dwell.&quot;</p>
                                   <p>I am a man among men, and if you should deem it advisable to
                                          reinstate me in the responsible position which I held in
                                          your tonsorial apartments, I can assure you that I will so
                                          conduct myself as to promote your business interests and
                                          bring the glad flush of pleasure to the cheek of your most
                                          fastidious patron. Do not condemn a young man for all time
                                          because of one offense. Never before, during my entire
                                          occupancy of the position at your establishment, did I
                                          forget the ancient glory of my race or my own standing as
                                          an Afro-American, and allow myself to fall into the
                                          clutches of the rum fiend. Now that I have come to a new
                                          realization of the scriptural line, &quot;At the last

                                          spirituous, vinous or malt intoxicating liquors, and
                                          especially gin and honey.</p>

                                          forgotten, and that we soon resume those relations which
                                          were productive of pleasure to me and, I am quite sure, of
                                          some pecuniary profit to you. I have the extreme honor to

                                   <p>Pink had been listening to the dictation with such consuming
                                          interest that his eyes were set and staring, and his lower
                                          lip hung down and out like a drooping red petal. When the
                                          morning customer spoke to him he blinked and shook his
                                          head slowly as if he were coming out of heavy slumber.</p>

                                          as follows:</p>

                                   <p>Next morning he did not go to Mr. Clifford&apos;s shop. He
                                          knew that if he seemed overwilling to promote an intimacy,
                                          Pink would no longer hold him in awe.</p>
                                   <p>On the second morning he went to the shop. Pink arose from the

                                          responded with a conservative nod, and <pb

                                          without speaking. He knew that if he encouraged
                                          familiarity at this crisis, he might lose his place as an
                                          oracle, and certainly he would cease to be a height.</p>
                                   <p>Pink was somewhat abashed by the coolness of his patron. He
                                          went to work quietly, and after a while he said:
                                          &quot;Well, seh, I &apos;m back

                                   <p>Now, although the morning customer did not aspire to become
                                          private secretary to Pink, combining the duties of that
                                          office with his continuous task as oracle, he felt it to
                                          be his bounden duty to compose a letter to Miss Lorena
                                          Jackson. He did not attempt to excuse Pink&apos;s
                                          conduct on the night of the reception given by the Sons
                                          and Daughters of Esther, and he admitted to himself that
                                          Pink had practiced a confidence game on Miss Jackson by
                                          his implied promise to give her a bicycle. Pink was not
                                          worthy, that seemed certain, and yet the morning customer
                                          forgave him, in that easy charity which enables to to
                                          forgive so many sins that are not directly against as. He
                                          prepared <pb id="VAA2422-128" n="102"/> a letter, and when
                                          he had concluded it, he smiled brightly to himself, for he
                                          believed the letter to be one of the best things he had
                                          written.</p>
                                   <p>At the barber-shop he passed the solicitous Mr. Clifford and
                                          his associates, and climbed to the throne, where he
                                          waited.</p>
                                   <p>&quot;Can you tell me about the gentleman in charge of
                                          this department?&quot; he asked.</p>
                                   <p>&quot;Pink! &quot;shouted Mr. Adams.</p>
                                   <p>&quot;Yes, seh right heah, seh,&quot; came a voice
                                          from behind the morning customer, and Pink emerged from
                                          the corner pocket, and with his head far back looked at
                                          the morning customer from under wavering eyelids.</p>
                                   <p>&quot;You want to keep awake, there,&quot; said Mr.
                                          Adams very sternly.</p>
                                   <p>&quot;Yes, seh,&quot; replied Pink meekly, with a

                                          asked in a low tone: &quot;You heah Misteh Adams make

                                   <p>He leaned over and read, and during the reading Pink was so
                                          absorbed that he simply rubbed the shoe in a slow and

                                   <p>&quot;I have been meditating to-day upon the cruelties of
                                          Fate. Only a few days ago we were bound together by the
                                          reciprocal bonds of Love&apos;s young dream. To-day
                                          you scorn the sable Lothario who, figuratively speaking,
                                          prostrates himself at the shrine of Beauty and begs the
                                          slight meed of forgiveness, even if he can never again
                                          bask in the dazzling effulgence of your incandescent
                                          society. Something tells me that a dark cloud has come
                                          between us. Who can it be that would seek to uproot the
                                          building tendrils of Platonic love and plant in place
                                          thereof the noxious weeds of venomous hatred? Surely these
                                          words will convey to your susceptible woman&apos;s
                                          heart some approximate conception of the mental anguish
                                          which racks my sturdy frame. The birds, sweet harbingers
                                          of spring, will soon be disporting themselves in the
                                          trees, ever and anon bursting forth into joyous
                                          melody.</p>

                                          listen to the soughing wind whisper its message to our
                                          eager souls. I await a token which will bring me,
                                          palpitating with love, to make amends for all the sad and
                                          bitter past. I beg to subscribe myself, very

                                   <p>About a week after the morning customer had read the letter
                                          from Miss Lorena Jackson, he made another visit to Mr.
                                          Clifford&apos;s shop. Pink was very happy and
                                          explained that as soon as he had paid off a few small
                                          debts he expected to open an account in a savings bank.
                                          When he had finished cleaning the morning
                                          customer&apos;s shoes, preparatory to spreading the
                                          first layer of dressing, a tall negro came down the
                                          stairway and put his head in at the door.</p>
                                   <p>&quot;Misteh Mahsh heah? &quot; he asked.</p>
                                   <p>Mr. Clifford, the potentate of the shop, was rubbing a quinine
                                          tonic into the thin fuzz belonging to a fat man whose
                                          jowls lapped down on the napkin and whose eyes were wide
                                          open from the zest of the <pb id="VAA2422-152" n="122"/>
                                          occasion. At brief intervals he groaned with enjoyment,
                                          for it is a fact that having one&apos;s head rubbed is
                                          a pure and noble pleasure on which the gods have set no
                                          high price. Between these groans the fat man advanced his
                                          views on the subject of tariff legislation. Every opinion
                                          was warmly seconded by Mr. Clifford, who was fully able to
                                          think tariff and rub the fat man&apos;s head, both at
                                          the same time.</p>
                                   <p>The interruption of the tariff discussion seemed to annoy Mr.
                                          Clifford. He did not condescend to answer the question put
                                          to him. He simply made an inclination of the head toward
                                          the remote corner in which Pink and the morning customer
                                          were having their quiet session.</p>
                                   <p>&quot;Good mawning, Pink,&quot;said the visitor,
                                          advancing briskly, and trailing a small bamboo cane on the
                                          floor.</p>
                                   <p>&quot;How do, Gawge,&quot; replied Pink, as he looked
                                          up at the visitor, and then, through some mysterious
                                          influence which directs <pb id="VAA2422-153" n="123"/> the
                                          happiness of Afro-American souls, both of them began to
                                          shake with laughter.</p>
                                   <p>The so-called &quot;Gawge&quot; was rather
                                          tan-colored. A small allotment of freckles gave his face a
                                          rusty tinge, while the kinks of his hair and mustache were
                                          touched with auburn. He wore a high stiff hat with a
                                          narrow rim, a suit of navy blue, which had become spotted
                                          black here and there by usage, and the morning customer
                                          made particular note of his scarfpin, which was a large
                                          owl&apos;s head, carved of bone and having knobby
                                          glass eyes.</p>

                                   <p>The morning customer had heard of men losing weight and
                                          drooping away to melancholy through disappointment in
                                          love, but he observed that Pink was too much of a
                                          philosopher to keep company with grief. The boy gave up
                                          Lorena Jackson with no sigh of regret. He no longer talked
                                          of her.</p>

                                          a secret sorrow, said in the most casual way:</p>

                                   <p>&quot;You have it all figured out,&quot; said the
                                          morning customer, &quot;and I do n&apos;t see how
                                          they can lose you.&quot;</p>
                                   <p>Pink was much elated to think that he had not been trapped
                                          into expressing any doubt as to scriptural revelation.</p>

                                   <p>The friendship between the morning customer and Pink lasted
                                          well, because it was never allowed to drift into
                                          familiarity. Whenever the morning customer climbed to the
                                          throne, he was greeted with formal politeness. He listened
                                          gravely when Pink told his secrets, and, by fine tact,
                                          invited confidence even while repelling intimacy. He
                                          seldom spoke of himself, and there never can be a real
                                          companionship between two persons until they have compared
                                          experiences.</p>
                                   <p>After the months had passed, Pink knew the morning customer as
                                          an exalted and dignified personage who had command of the
                                          wisdom of all ages and allowed his light to shine. And
                                          that was all he knew.</p>
                                   <pb id="VAA2422-194" n="158"/>
                                   <p>The morning customer, on the other hand, knew Pink&apos;s
                                          biographythe boy&apos;s early life in an Ohio town,
                                          how he followed the race horses to Chicago, why he gave up
                                          working in a dairy lunchroom, and so on, up to the time
                                          when he took the room at Mrs. Willard&apos;s house and
                                          was placed in charge of the boot-polishing department in
                                          Mr. Clifford&apos;s shop.</p>
                                   <p>It has already appeared that he learned of Pink&apos;s
                                          habits, his falling from grace, and his recovery of the
                                          high intentions to be important and have money of his own.
                                          With each visit the morning customer learned something
                                          more regarding the boy. For instance, one morning the
                                          conversation turned upon the subject of dramatic art, and
                                          Pink gave the opinion that &quot;Camille&quot; was
                                          the greatest play ever written.</p>
                                   <p>&quot;Took a guhl to see &apos;at
                                          &apos;Camille&apos; one night,&quot; he said.
                                          &quot;She jus&apos; shiveh an&apos; hang on to
                                          me all &apos;e way home. I got puhty well roused
                                          myse&apos;f.&quot;</p>
                                   <pb id="VAA2422-195" n="159"/>
                                   <p>At another time, soon after Pink had expressed his entire
                                          faith in the Bible (as set forth in the preceding
                                          chapter), he talked of music, and said that
                                          &quot;rag-time&quot; melodies pleased him, but
                                          that he dared not listen to them during business hours,
                                          because the mists came before his eyes and he became so
                                          excited that he could not shine shoes. He told of his
                                          belief that the angels in heaven played
                                          &quot;rag-time&quot; music, and he regarded this
                                          as an inducement for all colored people to lead pure
                                          lives.</p>
                                   <p>While they were talking of &quot;rag-time&quot; music,
                                          the morning customer asked why it was that a colored man
                                          could dance so much better than a white man. Pink advanced
                                          the explanation that the colored man had fewer bones than
                                          the white man, and had his joints peculiarly constructed,
                                          according to an all-wise plan. He also held that the white
                                          men&apos;s bones were &quot;brickle,&quot;
                                          while the colored man could <pb id="VAA2422-196" n="160"/>
                                          bend his frame and assume certain shapes which added to
                                          the charm of his performance as a dancer. The morning
                                          customer shook his head in doubt, and Pink said that a
                                          doctor had once explained to him the construction of a
                                          colored man, telling him, among other things, that the
                                          skull was an inch thick and that the only tender part of
                                          the anatomy was the shin-bone.</p>
                                   <p>It happened that just after Pink had won his point concerning
                                          the bony structure of the members of his race, two barbers
                                          and a man in the second chair became involved in loud talk
                                          about the continuous war-cloud in Europe. This
                                          interruption gave the morning customer a chance to retire
                                          gracefully from the dispute as to anatomy, so he
                                          asked:</p>
                                   <p>&quot;Have you been reading the war news in the
                                          papers?&quot;</p>

                                          and supplied him with the remnant of a morning paper,
                                          after which he returned to the morning customer, with a

                                   <p>Pink smiled in upward admiration, and then his shoulders shook

                                          letter which was to give Pink Marsh a sure standing with
                                          Belle Hopkins&apos;s mother. He pushed aside the
                                          letters waiting to be answered, and devoted himself to the
                                          labor of love. Was he prompted by the hopes of a reward?
                                          Noneexcept that reward which comes to the unselfish man
                                          when he knows that he has helped to complicate a love
                                          affair.</p>

                                          promise had been given. Pink was anxious to hear the
                                          letter, and he exercised great haste in shining a pair of
                                          scaly gaiters, so that he could go into a close session

                                          Dear Madam: It is with feelings of indiscriminate respect
                                          that I address you upon a subject which I regard as
                                          altogether behooving.</p>
                                   <lg>

                                   <p>&quot;How true this is! It is with excruciating surprise
                                          that I learn of a recent attempt to cast aspersions on my
                                          character, which I have always sought to keep herbiverous.
                                          As you are doubtless cognizant, I have lately endeavored
                                          to place myself in immediate juxtaposition to your
                                          daughter, Belle, whose caloric properties are such as to
                                          excite my profound admiration. At present she is the most
                                          salubrious object within my range of vision. Animated, no
                                          doubt, by the rancor of envy, some inconsequential marplot
                                          is striving to elucidate my superiority. I wish to deny
                                          emphatically anything you may hear which is not derogatory
                                          to my character. Without going into details, I may say
                                          with all the vehemence of asseveration, <pb

                                          This epistle will doubtless remove all eccentricities from
                                          your mind, and make you disposed to regard me as the
                                          proper recipient of gustatory favors. Thanking you for
                                          your kind attention, I am, with sufficient respect, yours

                                          &quot;O, man! O, man! O, man!&quot;</p>

                                          said the morning customer. &quot;I simply put in a

                                   <p>Pink yawped at the idea, and leaned forward on the box in a
                                          convulsion of mirth.</p>

                                   <p>By this time Pink was talking to himself and wagging his head
                                          gravely. The morning customer interrupted the soliloquy,
                                          and said &quot;I &apos;m afraid you &apos;ll
                                          never realize your expectations, unless you stop playing

                                   <p>The morning customer went away, leaving Pink cheered and
                                          uplifted by the abiding pleasures of hope.</p>

                                   <p>&quot;He come in here yesterday smokin&apos; a big
                                          cigar and all dressed up in his best clothes, and said he

                                          better.&quot;</p>
                                   <p>Mr. Clifford was speaking. The morning customer stood in
                                          hesitancy, looking at the half-grown colored youth who sat
                                          on Pink&apos;s stool in the corner, humped above a
                                          patent-leather shoe which had the shape of a
                                          sword-fish.</p>
                                   <p>&quot;You don&apos;t know where he went?&quot;
                                          asked the morning customer.</p>
                                   <p>&quot;No, and I do n&apos;t care. I won&apos;t
                                          have him around here again. This new boy&apos;s all
                                          right. He &apos;ll give you a good
                                          shine.&quot;</p>
                                   <p>Mr. Clifford evidently believed that the morning customer had
                                          been coming into the place to have his shoes shined!</p>
                                   <pb id="VAA2422-232" n="189"/>
                                   <p>The morning customer murmured a falsehood to the effect that
                                          he might &quot;come in later,&quot; and then he
                                          retreated, before Mr. Clifford could say anything more in
                                          favor of the new boy.</p>
                                   <p>That was his last visit to the shop. He rather expected to
                                          receive a communication from Pink, but no postal-card
                                          came, and, to tell the truth, after a few days had passed,
                                          he gave no further thought to the
                                          &quot;lansimous&quot; boy and his quest for a
                                          &quot;baby.&quot;</p>
                                   <p>In a busy town, such as Chicago, experiences crowd upon one
                                          another, and every live man of the morning-customer kind
                                          is so intent on making his fortune that he has little time
                                          to tilt back and wonder what has become of the friends of
                                          yesterday. Within a month after the disappearance, the
                                          season of helpful talks with Pink became ancient history.
                                          The morning customer hurried past Mr. Clifford&apos;s
                                          shop day after day, without seeing it <pb id="VAA2422-233"
                                                 n="190"/> or knowing of its existence. He would be
                                          whispering to himself the terms of a contract, or
                                          squinting through his glasses to see into the plans of
                                          those who wanted to keep him away from his fortune. To
                                          such a man, buildings fuse into one another as they slide
                                          by in panorama, and pedestrians are so many things to be
                                          dodged. The morning customer raced every day. He went to a
                                          &quot;parlor&quot; to have his shoes cleaned.
                                          Twelve white boys in blue jackets leaned over in a row and
                                          worked at high speed. They seldom spoke to the men in the
                                          chairs, who regarded one another with fretful suspicion,
                                          and turned their morning papers over and over and inside
                                          out.</p>
                                   <p>It would be satisfying to know that the morning customer often
                                          smiled at recollection of what Pink had told him, and
                                          wondered if the boy had saved any money.</p>
                                   <p>He had not the time. That is the fact of the matter. He was
                                          jumping with <pb id="VAA2422-234" n="191"/> elevators, a
                                          hundred feet at an upward leap; racing to court-rooms,
                                          where he messed papers and whispered with hollow-eyed
                                          accomplices; and sometimes he went out of town on night
                                          trains, so as to avoid the deadly sin of traveling during
                                          business hours.</p>
                                   <p>One night he boarded a train at a suburban crossing. The train
                                          was bound for Kansas City. In the sleeping-car the berths
                                          were &quot;made up.&quot; He went along the narrow
                                          aisle between the stuffy curtains to where a porter with a
                                          white coat was whispering to some hidden passenger.</p>
                                   <p>He nudged the porter from behind.</p>
                                   <p>&quot;My goodness, misteh!&quot;</p>
                                   <p>It was Pink.</p>
                                   <p>&quot;Any lowers left?&quot; asked the morning
                                          customer, closing his teeth together in the endeavor to
                                          keep a serious face.</p>
                                   <p>&quot;Well, my goodness, misteh! Well, seh, it&apos;s

                                   <p>&quot;Where &apos;s the conductor.&quot;</p>
                                   <p>&quot;Yes, seh, he&apos;s in &apos;e cah ahead,

                                   <p>&quot;Well, I&apos;ll sit in the smoking-room a
                                          while.&quot;</p>
                                   <p>He went into the smoking compartment and lighted a cigar. A
                                          short man with jewelry and a silk cap had been holding the
                                          compartment alone. He looked up, as if in annoyance, when
                                          the morning customer came in, and then threw away his
                                          cigar and rocked away to bed.</p>
                                   <p>The morning customer sprawled out on the plush cushion and
                                          smoked. He grinned around his cigar, and once or twice he

                            <p>&quot;Artie is a character, and George Ade has limned him deftly,
                                   as well as amusingly. Under his rollicking abandon and
                                   recklessness we are made to feel the real sense and sensitiveness
                                   and the worldly wisdom of a youth whose only language is that of
                                   a street-gamin. As a study of the peculiar type chosen, it is

                            <p>&quot;It is brimful of fun and picturesque slang. Nobody will be
                                   any the worse for reading about Artie, if he does talk slang.
                                   He&apos;s a good fellow at heart, and Mamie Carroll is the
                                   &apos;making of him.&apos; He talks good sense and good
                                   morality, and these things have n&apos;t yet gone out of

                                                 <p>&quot;Since Daniel Defoe, no such consummate
                                                  master of realistic fiction has arisen among us as
                                                  Mr. Arthur Morrison. Hardly any praise could be
                                                  too much for the imaginative power and artistic
                                                  perfection and beauty of this picture of the
                                                  depraved and loathsome phases of human life. There
                                                  is all of Defoe&apos;s fidelity of realistic
                                                  detail, suffused with the light and warmth of a
                                                  genius higher and purer than
                                                  Defoe&apos;s.&quot; <hi rend="i"

                                                 <p>&quot;It more than fulfills the promise of
                                                  &apos;Tales of Mean Streets&apos;it makes
                                                  you confident that Mr. Morrison has yet better
                                                  work to do. The power displayed is magnificent,
                                                  and the episode of the murder of Weech,
                                                  &apos;fence&apos; and
                                                  &apos;nark,&apos; and of the capture and
                                                  trial of his murderer, is one that stamps itself
                                                  upon the memory as a thing done once and for all.
                                                  Perrott in the dock, or as he awaits the
                                                  executioner, is a fit companion of Fagin
                                                  condemned. The book cannot but confirm the
                                                  admirers of Mr. Morrison&apos;s remarkable

                                                 <p>&quot;Mr. Morrison has achieved an
                                                  astonishing success. Take it as a whole, as a
                                                  picture of a phase of life, and you must admit
                                                  that it is a masterly achievementa triumph of art.
                                                  It is a distinct advance upon his earlier book,
                                                  &apos;Tales of Mean Streets,&apos;
                                                  because, it seems to us, it is truer, more
                                                  convincing, less dispiriting. The biggest thing in
                                                  the book is the description of him after the
                                                  murder, and when he is on trial. It is a wonderful
                                                  bit of psychology; done so simply, and apparently
                                                  without any eye to effect, but overpoweringly
                                                  convincing. The book is a masterpiece.&quot;
