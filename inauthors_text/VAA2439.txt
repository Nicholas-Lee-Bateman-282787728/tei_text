                        THE DAYS GONE BY.
                        
                            O the days gone by! O the days gone by!
                            The apples in the orchard and the pathway through the rye;
                            The chirrup of the robin, and the whistle of the quail
                            As he piped across the meadows sweet as any nightingale;
                            When the bloom was on the clover, and the blue was in the
                                sky,
                            And my happy heart brimmed overin the days gone by!
                        
                        
                            In the days gone by, when my naked feet were tripped
                            By the honeysuckle tangles where the water-lilies dipped,
                            And the ripples of the river lipped the moss along the
                                brink
                            Where the placid-eyed and lazy-footed cattle came to
                                drink,
                            And the tilting snipe stood fearless of the truant's
                                wayward cry
                            And the splashing of the swimmer, in the days gone by!
                        
                        
                        
                            O the days gone by! O the days gone by!
                            The music of the laughing lip, the luster of the eye;
                            The childish faith in fairies, the Aladdin's magic
                                ring
                            The simple, soul-reposing, glad belief in everything,
                            For life was like a story, holding neither sob nor sigh,
                            In the golden olden glory of the days gone by.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        WITH THE CURRENT.
                        
                            RAREST mood of all the year!
                            Aimless, idle, and content;
                            Sky and earth and atmosphere
                            Wholly indolent.
                        
                        
                            Low and clear, and pure and deep
                            Ripples of the river sing
                            Water lilies, half asleep,
                            Drowsed with listening.
                        
                        
                            Tremulous reflex of skies
                            Skies above and skies below
                            Paradise and Paradise
                            Blending even so!
                        
                        
                            Blossoms with their leaves unrolled
                            Laughingly, as they were lips
                            Cleft with ruddy beaten gold,
                            Tongues of petal tips.
                        
                        
                            Rush and reed, and thorn and vine
                            Clumped with grasses lithe and tall
                            And a web of summer shine
                            Woven round it all.
                        
                        
                        
                            Back and forth and to and fro,
                            Flashing scale and wing as one,
                            Dragonflies that come and go,
                            Shuttled by the sun.
                        
                        
                            Fairy songs and lullabies
                            Fine as phantasy conceives
                            Echoes wrought of cricket cries
                            Sifted through the leaves.
                        
                        
                            O'er the rose, with drowsy buzz,
                            Hangs the bee, and stays his kiss,
                            Even as my fancy does,
                            Darling, over this.
                        
                        
                            Lo, let us forget all care,
                            And as listless as the day
                            Drift adown it, half aware,
                            Anywhere we may.
                        
                        
                            Drift and curve, and deviate,
                            Veer and eddy, float and flow,
                            Waver, swerve and undulate,
                            As the bubbles go.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THOUGHTS FER THE DISCURAGED FARMER.
                        
                            THE summer winds is snifflin' round
                                the bloomin' locus' trees;
                            And the clover in the pastur' is a big-day fer the
                                bees,
                            And they ben a-swiggin' honey, above-board and on the
                                sly,
                            Till they stutter in their buzzin', and stagger as
                                they fly.
                            The flicker on the fence-rail 'pears to jest spit on
                                his wings
                            And roll up his feathers, by the sassy way he sings;
                            And the hoss-fly is a-whettin'-up his fore-legs fer
                                biz,
                            And the off-mare is a-switchin' all of her tail they
                                is.
                        
                        
                            You can hear the blackbirds jawin' as they foller up
                                the plow
                            Oh! they'r bound to get theyr breakfast, and
                                they'r not a-carin' how;
                            So they quarrel in the furries, and they quarrel on the
                                wing
                        
                        
                        
                            But theyr peaceabler in pot-pies than any other thing.
                            And its when I git my shotgun drawed up in stiddy rest,
                            She's as full of tribbleation as a
                                yaller-jacket's nest;
                            And a few shots before dinner, when the sun's
                                a-shinin' right,
                            Seems to kindo-sorto sharpen-up a feller's
                                appetite!
                        
                        
                            Theys ben a heap o' rain, but the sun's out
                                today,
                            And the clouds of the wet spell is all cleared away,
                            And the woods is all the greener, and the grass is greener
                                still;
                            It may rain agin tomorry, but I don't think it
                                will.
                            Some says the crops is ruined, and the corn's
                                drownded out,
                            And propha-sy the wheat will be a failure, without doubt,
                            But the kind Providence that has never failed us yet,
                            Will be on hands onct more at the 'leventh hour, I
                                bet.
                        
                        
                        
                            Does the medder-lark complain, as he swims high and dry
                            Through the waves of the wind and the blue of the sky?
                            Does the quail set up and whistle in a disappointed way,
                            Er hang his head in silence and sorrow all the day?
                            Is the chipmunk's health a-failin'? Does he
                                walk, or does he run?
                            Don't the buzzards ooze around up thare just like
                                they've allus done?
                            Is they anything the matter with the rooster's lungs
                                er voice?
                            Ort a mortal be complainin' when dumb animals
                                rejoice?
                        
                        
                            Then let us, one and all, be contented with our lot.
                            The June is here this morning, and the sun is shining hot.
                            Oh! let us fill our harts up with the glory of the day,
                            And banish every doubt and care and sorrow far away!
                            Whatever be our station, with Providence fer guide,
                            Such fine circumstances ort to make us satisfied,
                            
                            Fer the world is full of roses, and the roses full of dew,
                            And the dew is full of heavenly love that drips for me and
                                you.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        IN THE AFTERNOON.
                        
                            YOU in the hammock, and I, near by,
                            Was trying to read, and swing you, too;
                            And the green of the sward was so kind to the eye,
                            And the shade of the maples so cool and blue,
                            That I often looked from the book to you
                            To say as much with a sigh.
                        
                        
                            You in the hammock. The book we'd brought
                            From the parlorto read in the open air,
                            Something of love and of Launcelot
                            And Guinevere, I believe, was there
                            But the afternoon it was far more fair
                            Than the poem was, I thought.
                        
                        
                            You in the hammockAnd on and on
                            I droned through, the rhythmic stuff
                            But, with always a half of my vision gone
                            Over the top of the pageenough
                            To caressingly gaze at you, swathed in the
                                fluff
                            Of your hair and your odorous "lawn."
                        
                        
                        
                            You in the hammockAnd that was a year
                            Fully a year ago, I guess
                            And what do we care for their Guinevere
                            And her Launcelot and their lordliness!
                            You in the hammock still, andYes
                            Kiss me again, my dear!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE BABY.
                        
                            I.
                            O THIS is the way the baby came:
                            Out of the night as comes the dawn;
                            Out of the embers as the flame;
                            Out of the bud the blossom on
                            The apple-bough that blooms the same
                            As in glad summers dead and gone
                            With a grace and beauty none could name
                            O this is the way the baby came!
                        
                        
                            II.
                            And this is the way the baby 'woke:
                            As when in deepest drops of dew
                            The shine and shadows sink and soak,
                            The sweet eyes glimmered through and through,
                            And eddyings and dimples broke
                            About the lips, and no one knew
                            Or could divine the words they spoke
                            And this is the way the baby 'woke.
                        
                        
                            III.
                            And this is the way the baby slept:
                            A mist of tresses backward thrown
                            By quavering sighs where kisses crept
                            With yearnings she had never known:
                            
                            The little hands were closely kept
                            About a lily newly blown
                            And God was with her. And we wept
                            And this is the way the baby slept.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        BECALMED.
                        
                            I.
                            WOULD that the winds might only blow,
                            As they blew in the golden long ago!
                            Laden with odors of Orient isles
                            Where ever and ever the sunshine smiles,
                            And the bright sands blend with shady trees,
                            And the lotus bloom in the midst of these.
                        
                        
                            II.
                            Warm winds won from the midland vales
                            To where the trees of the siren trails,
                            O'er the flossy tip of the mountain phlox,
                            And the bare limbs twined in the crested rocks,
                            High above as the seagull's flap
                            Their lopping wings at the thunder-clap.
                        
                        
                            III.
                            Ah! that the winds might rise and blow
                            The great surge up from the port below,
                            Bloating the sad, lank silken sails
                            Of the Argo out with the swift, sweet gales
                            That blew from Colchis when Jason had
                            His love's full will and his heart was glad
                            When Medea's voice was soft and low.
                            Ah! that the winds might rise and blow!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        ART AND LOVE.
                        
                            HE faced his canvas (as a seer whose ken
                            Pierces the crust of this existence through)
                            And smiled beyond on that his genius knew
                            Ere mated with his being. Conscious then
                            Of his high theme alone, he smiled again
                            Straight back upon himself in many a hue,
                            And tint, and light, and shade, that slowly
                                grew
                            Enfeatured of a fair girl's face, as when
                            First time she smiles for love sake with no
                                fear.
                            So wrought he, witless that behind him leant
                            A woman, with old features, dim and sere,
                            And glamoured eyes that felt the brimming
                                tear,
                            And with a voice, like some sad instrument,
                            That sighing said, "I'm dead
                                there; love me here!"
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        ONLY WANTED A CHANCE.
                        
                            "'S CURIOUS
                                like!" said the tree-toad,
                            "I've twittered for rain all day,
                            And I got up soon

                            Was just about give in;

                            Around the gills. He hawked some
                            And cleared his th'oat and said;
                            "Facts is too complicated

                            Squirmed and told the barber then
                            He wisht he'd hurry through.
                        
                        
                            Well, then I knowed I had him,

                            Was all a-winkin' at me,
                            As the barber raised him higher
                            Says I, "Jedge, what's a dollar?

                            He says to the barber
                            "I want fresh air!"
                            And you'd a-died a-laughin'

                                friend to me,
                            Through days of sore afflictions and dire adversity,
                            You allus had a kind word of counsel to impart,
                            Which was like a healin' 'intment to the
                                sorrow of my hart.
                        
                        
                            When I buried my first womern, William Leachman, it was you
                            Had the only consolation that I could listen to
                            Fer I knowed you had gone through it and had rallied from the
                                blow,
                            And when you said I'd do the same, I knowed
                                you'd orto know.
                        
                        
                            But that time I'll long remember, how I wandered here
                                and there
                            Through the settin-room and kitchen, and out in the open
                                air
                            And the snowflakes whirlin', whirlin', and
                                the fields a frozen glare,
                            And the neighbors' sleds and wagons
                                congregatin' everywhare.
                        
                        
                        
                            I turned my eyes tords heaven, but the sun was hid away;
                            I turned my eyes tords earth, again, but all was cold and
                                gray;
                            And the clock, like ice a-crackin', clickt the icy
                                hours in two
                            And my eyes'd never thawed out ef it hadn't
                                been fer you.
                        
                        
                            We set there by the smoke-houseme and you out thare alone
                            Me a-thinkin'me a-thinkin' of the summers
                                long ago,
                            And a-writin' "Marthy Marthy," with
                                my finger in the snow!
                            William Leachman, I can see you jest as plain as I could
                                then;
                            And your hand is on my shoulder, and you rouse me up
                                again;
                            And I see the tears a-drippin' from your own eyes, as
                                you say:
                            "Be reconciled and bear itwe but linger fer a
                                day!"
                            At the last Old Settlers' Meetin' we went
                                jintly, you and me
                            Your hosses and my wagon, as you wanted it to be;
                            
                            And sence I can remember, from the time we've
                                neighbored here,
                            In all sich friendly actions you have double-done your
                                sheer.
                        
                        
                            It was better than the meetin', too, that 9-mild talk
                                we had
                        
                        
                            Of the times that we first settled here and travel was so
                                bad;
                            When we had to go on hoss-back, and sometimes on
                                "Shankses mare,"
                            And "blaze" a road fer them behind that had
                                to travel thare.
                        
                        
                            And now we was a-trottin' 'long a level
                                gravel pike,
                            In a big two-hoss road-wagon, jest as easy as you like
                            Two of us on the front seat, and our wimern folks behind,
                            A-settin' in their Winsor cheers in perfect peace of
                                mind!
                            And we pointed out old landmarks, nearly faded out of
                                sight:
                            Thare they ust to rob the stage-coach; thare Gash Morgan had
                                the fight
                            With the old stag-deer that pronged himhow he battled fer his
                                life,
                            
                            And lived to prove the story by the handle of his knife.
                        
                        
                            Thare the first griss-mill was put up in the settlement, and
                                we
                            Had tuck our grindin' to it in the fall of
                                Forty-three
                            When we tuck our rifles with us, techin' elbows all
                                the way,
                            And a-stickin' right together every minute, night and
                                day.
                        
                        
                            Thare ust to stand the tavern that they called the
                                "Traveler's Rest,"
                            And thare, beyent the covered bridge, "the
                                Counterfitter's nest"
                            Whare they claimed the house was ha'ntedthat a man
                                was murdered thare,
                            And burried underneath the floor, er round the place
                                somewhare.
                        
                        
                            And the Old Plank road they laid along in Fifty-one er two
                            You know we talked about the times when that old road was
                                new:
                            How "Uncle Sam" put down that road and never
                                taxed the state
                            Was a problem, don't you rickollect, we
                                couldn't dimonstrate?
                        
                        
                        
                            Ways are devious, William Leachman, that me and you has
                                past;
                            But as I found you true at first, I find you true at last,
                            And, now the time's a-comin' mighty nigh our
                                journey's end,
                            I want to throw wide open all my soul to you, my friend.
                        
                        
                            With the stren'th of all my bein', and the
                                heat of hart and brain,
                            And every livin' drop of blood in artery and
                                vein,
                            I love you and respect you, and I venerate your name,
                            For the name of William Leachman and True Manhood's
                                jest the same!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        DAN O'SULLIVAN.
                        
                            DAN O'Sullivan: It's
                                your

                            Whist yez! Dan O'Sullivan!
                            Him that made the Irishman
                            Mixt the burds in wid the dough,
                            And the dew and mistletoe
                            Wid the whusky in the quare
                            Muggs av usand here we air,
                            Three parts right, and three parts wrong,
                            Shpiked wid beauty, wit and song!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        SWEET BELLS JANGLED.
                        
                            I WILL not hear the dying word
                            Of any friend, or stroke the wing
                            Of any little wounded bird
                            Love is the deadest thing!
                        
                        
                            I wist not if I see the smile
                            Of any lad, in street or lane;
                            I only know that after while
                            He will not smile again.
                        
                        
                            The summer blossom at my feet
                            Swims backward, drowning in the grass;
                            I will not stay to call it sweet
                            Sink out! and let me pass!
                        
                        
                            I have no mind to feel the touch
                            Of gentle hands on brow or hair;
                            The lack of this once pained me much,
                            And so I have a care.
                        
                        
                            Dead weeds, and husky rustling leaves
                            That beat the dead boughs where you cling,
                            And old dead nests beneath the eaves
                            Love is the deadest thing!
                        
                        
                        
                            Ah! once I fared not all alone;
                            And once, no matter, rain or snow,
                            The summer sun forever shone
                            Because I loved her so!
                        
                        
                            With always tremblings in her hands,
                            And always blushes unaware,
                            And always ripples down the strands
                            Of her long yellow hair.
                        
                        
                            I needs must weep a little space,
                            Remembering her laughing eyes,
                            And curving lip, and lifted face,
                            And look of mock surprise.
                        
                        
                            O joy is dead in every part,
                            And faith and hope; and so I sing
                            In all the graveyard of my heart
                            Love is the deadest thing!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        WORTER-MELON TIME.
                        
                            Old worter-melon time is comin' round agin,
                            And they haint no man a-livin' any
                                tickleder 'n me.
                            For the way I hanker after worter-melons is a sin
                            Which is the why and wherefore, as you can plainly
                                see.
                        
                        
                            Oh, it's in the sandy soil worter-melons does the
                                best,
                            And it's there they'll lay and
                                waller in the sunshine and the dew
                            Till they wear all the green streaks clean off of their
                                breast,
                            And you bet I ain't a-findin' any
                                fault with them; air you?
                        
                        
                            They ain't no better thing in the vegetable line;
                            And they don't need much
                                tendin', as every farmer knows;
                            And when they're ripe and ready fer to pluck from the
                                vine,
                            I want to say to you they're the best fruit that
                                grows.
                        
                        
                        
                            It's some likes the yeller core, and some likes the
                                red,
                            And it's some says the little
                                "Californy" is the best;
                            But the sweetest slice of all that I ever wedged in my
                                head
                            Is the old "Edingburg
                                Mounting-sprout" of the West.
                        
                        
                            You don't want no punkins nigh your wortermelon
                                vines
                            Cause, someway-another, they'll spile
                                your melons, shore;
                            I've seed 'em taste like punkins, from the
                                core to the rines,
                            Which may be a fact you have heerd of before.
                        
                        
                            But your melons at's raised right, and tended to with
                                care,
                            You can walk around amongst 'em with a
                                parent's pride and joy,
                            And thump 'em on the heads with as fatherly a
                                air,
                            As ef each one of them was your little girl or
                                boy.
                        
                        
                            I joy in my hart jest to hear that rippin' sound
                            When you split one down the back and jolt the
                                halves in two,
                            
                            And the friends you love the best is gethered all around
                            And you say unto your best friend, "Oh,
                                here's the core for you!"
                        
                        
                            And I like to slice 'em up in big pieces fer
                                'em all,
                            Especially the children, and watch their high
                                delight,
                            As one by one the rines with their pink notches falls,
                            And they holler fer some more with unquenched
                                appetite.
                        
                        
                            Boys takes to it natural, and I like to see 'em
                                eat
                            A slice of worter-melon's like a
                                french-harp in their hands.
                            And when they saw it through their mouths sich music
                                can't be beat
                            'Cause its music both the sperit and the
                                stummick understands.
                        
                        
                            Oh, they's more in worter-melons than the
                                purty-colored meat,
                            And the overflowin' sweetness of the
                                worter squashed betwixt
                            The upard and the downard motions of a feller's
                                teeth,
                            And its the taste of ripe old age and juicy
                                childhood mixed.
                        
                        
                        
                            Fer I taste a melon but my thoughts flies away
                            To the summertime of youth, and I see agin the
                                dawn
                            And the fadin' afternoon of the long summer day,
                            And the dusk and the dew a-fallin', and
                                the night a-comin' on.
                        
                        
                            And there's the corn around us, and the
                                lispin' leaves and trees,
                            And the stars a-peekin down on us as still as
                                silver mice,
                            And us boys in the worter-melons on our hands and knees,
                            And the new moon hangin' o'er us
                                like a yeller-cored slice.
                        
                        
                            Oh, its worter-melon time is a comin' 'round
                                agin,
                            And they ain't no man a-livin'
                                any tickleder than me,
                            For the way I hanker after worter-melons is a sin
                            Which is the why and wherefore, as you can plainly
                                see.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        WHEN THE FROST IS ON THE PUNKIN.
                        
                            WHEN the frost is on the punkin and the
                                fodder's in the shock,
                            And you hear the kyouck and gobble of the struttin'
                                turkey-cock,
                            And the clackin' of the guineys, and the
                                cluckin' of the hens,
                            And the rooster's hallylooyer as he tiptoes on the
                                fence;
                            O its then's the times a feller is a feelin'
                                at his best,
                            With the risin' sun to greet him from a night of
                                gracious rest,
                            As he leaves the house bare-headed and goes out to feed the
                                stock,
                            When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder's in
                                the shock.
                        
                        
                            They's somepin kindo' hearty-like about the
                                atmosphere,
                            When the heat of summer's over and the
                                coolin' Fall is here
                            Of course we miss the flowers, and the blossoms of the
                                trees,
                            
                            And the mumble of the hummin'-birds and the
                                buzzin' of the bees;
                            But the air's so appetizin'; and the
                                landscape through the haze
                            Of a crisp and sunny morning of the early autumn days
                            Is a picture no painter has the colorin' to mock
                            When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder's in
                                the shock.
                        
                        
                            The husky, rusty rustle of the tossols of the corn,
                            And the raspin' of the tangled leaves, as golden as
                                the morn;
                            The stubble in the furrieskindo' lonesome-like, but
                                still
                            A-preachin' sermons to us of the barns they growed to
                                fill;
                            The strawstack in the medder, and the reaper in the shed;
                            The hosses in their stalls belowthe clover overhead!
                            O it sets my heart a-clickin' like the
                                tickin' of a clock,
                            When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder's in
                                the shock!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        IN THE SOUTH.
                        
                            THERE is a princess in the South
                            About whose beauty rumors hum
                            As honey-bees about the mouth
                            Of roses dewdrops falter from;
                            And O her hair is like the fine
                            Clear amber of a jostled wine
                            In tropic revels; and her eyes
                            Are blue as rifts of paradise.
                        
                        
                            Such beauty as may none before
                            Kneel daringly, to kiss the tips
                            Of fingers such as knights of yore
                            Had died to lift against their lips:
                            Such eyes as might the eyes of gold
                            Of all the stars of night behold
                            With glittering envy, and so glare
                            In dazzling splendor of despair.
                        
                        
                            So, were I but a minstrel, deft
                            At weaving, with the trembling strings
                            Of my glad harp, the warp and weft
                            Of rondels such as rapture sings,
                            I'd loop my lyre across my breast,
                            Nor stay me till my knee found rest
                            In midnight banks of bud and flower
                            Beneath my lady's lattice-bower.
                        
                        
                        
                            And there, drenched with the teary dews,
                            I'd woo her with such wondrous art
                            As well might stanch the songs that ooze
                            Out of the mockbird's breaking heart;
                            So light, so tender, and so sweet
                            Should be the words I would repeat,
                            Her casement, on my gradual sight,
                            Would blossom as a lily might.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        WHEN THE HEARSE COMES BACK.
                        
                            A THING'st 's

                        THE MUTE SINGER.
                        
                            I.
                            THE morning sun seemed fair as though
                            It were a great red rose ablow
                            In lavish bloom,
                            With all the air for its perfume,
                            Yet he who had been wont to sing,
                            Could trill no thing.
                        
                        
                            II.
                            Supine, at noon, as he looked up
                            Into the vast inverted cup
                            Of heavenly gold,
                            Brimmed with its marvels manifold,
                            And his eyes kindled, and his cheek
                            Song would not speak.
                        
                        
                            III.
                            Night fell forebodingly; he knew
                            Soon must the rain be falling too,
                            And, home, hartsore,
                            A missive met him at the door
                            Then song lit on his lips, and he
                            Sang gloriously.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THREE DEAD FRIENDS.
                        
                            ALWAYS suddenly they are gone
                            The friends we trusted and held secure
                            Suddenly we are gazing on,
                            Not a smiling face, but the marble pure
                            Dead mask of a face that nevermore
                            To a smile of ours will make reply
                            The lips close-locked as the eye-lids are
                            Goneswift as a flash of the molten ore
                            A meteor pours through a midnight sky,
                            Leaving it blind of a single star.
                        
                        
                            II.
                            Tell us, O Death, remorseless Might!
                            What is the old unescapable ire
                            You wreak on us?from the birth of light
                            Till the world be charred to a core of fire!
                            We do no evil thing to you
                            We seek to evade youthat is all
                            That is your willyou will not be known
                            Of men. What, then, would you have us do?
                            Cringe and wait till your vengeance fall,
                            And your graves be fed, and the trumpet blown?
                        
                        
                        
                            III.
                            You desire no friends, but weO we
                            Need them so, as we falter here,
                            Fumbling through each new vacancy,
                            As each is stricken that we hold dear.
                            One you struck but a year ago:
                            And one not a month ago; and one
                            (God's vast pity!)and one lies now
                            Where the widow wails in her nameless woe,
                            And the soldiers pace, with the sword and gun,
                            Where the comrade sleeps, with the laureled
                                brow.
                        
                        
                            IV.
                            And what did the first? that wayward soul,
                            Clothed of sorrow, yet nude of sin,
                            And with all hearts bowed in the strange control
                            Of the heavenly voice of his violin.
                            Why, it was music the way he stood,
                            So grand was the poise of the head, and so
                            Full was the figure of majesty!
                            One heard with the eyes, as a deaf man would,
                            And with all sense brimmed to the overflow
                            With tears of anguish and ecstasy.
                        
                        
                            V.
                            And what did the girl, with the great warm light
                            Of genius sunning her eyes of blue,
                            
                            With her heart so pure, and her soul so white
                            What, O Death, did she do to you?
                            Through field and wood as a child she strayed,
                            As Nature, the dear, sweet mother, led;
                            While from her canvas, mirrored back,
                            Glimmered the stream through the everglade
                            Where the grapevine trailed from the trees to
                                wed
                            Its likeness of emerald, blue and black.
                        
                        
                            VI.
                            And what did he, who, the last of these,
                            Faced you with never a fear, O Death?
                            Did you hate HIM that he loved the breeze
                            And the morning dews, and the rose's
                                breath?
                            Did you hate him that he answered not
                            Your hate againbut turned, instead,
                            His only hate on his country's
                                wrongs?
                            Well, you possess him, dead! but what
                            Of the good he wrought? With laureled head
                            He bides with us in his deeds and songs.
                        
                        
                            VII.
                            Laureled, first, that he bravely fought,
                            And forged a way to our flag's
                                release;
                            Laureled, nextfor the harp he taught
                            To wake glad songs in the days of peace
                            
                            Songs of the woodland haunts he held
                            As close in his love as they held their bloom
                            In their inmost bosoms of leaf and vine
                            Songs that echoed, and pulsed, and welled
                            Through the town's pent streets, and the
                                sick child's room,
                            Pure as a shower in soft sunshine.
                        
                        
                            VIII.
                            Claim them, Death; yet their fame endures!
                            What friend next will you rend from us
                            In that cold, pitiless way of yours,
                            And leave us a grief more dolorous!
                            Speak to us! tell us, O Dreadful Power!
                            Are we not to have a lone friend left?
                            Since frozen, sodden, or green the sod,
                            Some one, Death, you have left thus bereft,
                            Half inaudibly shrieks to God.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        AWAY.
                        (In memoriam Gen. W. H. H. TERRELL.)
                        
                            I CANNOT sayand I will not say
                            That he is deadHe is just away!
                        
                        
                            With a cheery smile, and a wave of the hand

                            As though they were damp, and the echoes fall
                            Limp and unlovable.

                            With a twinkering guitar,
                            To come beneath my casement
                            Singing, "There is none above her,"
                            While I, leaning, seemed to hover
                            In the scent of his cigar!

                            O, at morn I'd want to meet him,
                            When the mist was in the sky,
                            And the dew along the path I went
                            To casually greet him,
                            And to cavalierly treat him,
                            And regret it by and by.
                        
                        
                            And I'd want to meet his brother
                            His brother! his brother!
                            O, I'd want to meet his brother
                            At the german or the play,
                            To pin a rose on his lapel
                            
                            And lightly press the other,
                            And love him like a mother
                            While he thought the other way.
                        
                        
                            O, I'd pitilessly test him!
                            And test him, and test him!
                            O, I'd pitilessly test him
                            Far beyond his own control;
                            And every tantalizing lure
                            With which I could arrest him,
                            I'd loosen to molest him,
                            Till I tried his very soul.
                        
                        
                            But ah, when I relented!
                            Relented, relented!
                            But oh, when I relented
                            When the stars were blurred and dim,
                            And the moon above, with crescent grace,
                            Looked off as I repented,
                            And with rapture half demented,
                            All my heart went out to him!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        UNINTERPRETED.
                        
                            SUPINELY we lie in the grove's
                                shady greenery,
                            Gazing, all dreamy-eyed, up through the trees,
                            And as to the sight is the heavenly scenery,
                            So to the hearing the sighing of the breeze.
                        
                        
                            We catch but vague rifts of the blue through the wavering
                            Boughs of the maples; and, like undefined,
                            The whispers and lisps of the leaves, faint and quavering,
                            Meaningless falter and fall on the mind.
                        
                        
                            The vine, with its beauty of blossom, goes rioting
                            Up by the casement, as sweet to the eye
                            As the trill of the robin is restful and quieting
                            Heard in a drowse with the dawn in the sky.
                        
                        
                            And yet we yearn on to learn more of the mystery
                            We see and we hear, but forever remain
                            Mute, blinded and deaf to the ultimate history
                            Born of a rose or a patter of rain.
                        
                        
                        
                            Could I but delve out the deeper sublimity
                            Hid in the lily that smiles as I write
                            Ah! my good friends, how in glad unanimity
                            You should read rhymes writ in fragrance and
                                white!
                        
                        
                            Or, could I translate the sweet song of merriment
                            Spilled from the wicker-cage hung in the hall,
                            How you should chuckle to hear what canary meant
                            By his wild tangle of twitter and call!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        UNLESS.
                        
                            Who has not suffered does not guess
                            What pleasure is. Who has not groped
                            In depths of doubt and hopelessness
                            Has never truly hoped
                            Unless, sometimes, a shadow falls
                            Upon his mirth, and veils his sight,
                            And from the darkness drifts the light
                            Of love at intervals.
                        
                        
                            And that most dear of everything,
                            I hold, is love; and who can sit
                            With lightest heart, and laugh and sing,
                            Knows not the worth of it.
                            Unless in some strange throng, perchance,
                            He feels how thrilling sweet it is,
                            One yearning look that answers his
                            The troth of glance and glance.
                        
                        
                            Who knows not pain, knows not, alas.
                            What pleasure is. Who knows not of
                            The bitter cup that will not pass,
                            Knows not the taste of love.
                            
                            O souls that thirst, and hearts that fast,
                            And nature faint with famishing,
                            God fondle you, and safely bring
                            You to your own at last.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        WHEN KNOTTED HORSE-TAILS ARE UNITED.
                        
                            WHEN country roads begin to thaw
                            In mottled spots of damp and dust,
                            And fences by the margin draw
                            Along the frosty crust
                            Their graphic silhouettes, I say,
                            The Spring is coming round this way.
                        
                        
                            When morning-time is bright with sun,
                            And keen with wind, and both confuse
                            The dancing, glancing eyes of one
                            With tears that ooze and ooze
                            And nose tips weep as well as they,
                            The Spring is coming round this way.
                        
                        
                            When suddenly some shadow-bird
                            Goes wavering beneath the gaze,
                            And through the hedge the moan is heard
                            Of kine that cease to graze
                            In grasses dead, I smile and say,
                            The Spring is coming round this way.
                        
                        
                        
                            When knotted horse-tails are united,
                            And teamsters whistle here and there,
                            And clumsy mitts are laid aside,
                            And choppers' hands are bare,
                            And chips are thick where children play,
                            The Spring is coming round this way.
                        
                        
                            When through the twigs the farmer tramps,
                            And troughs are chunked beneath the trees,
                            And fragrant hints of sugar camps
                            Astray in every breeze,
                            And early March seems middle-May,
                            The Spring is coming round this way.
                            When coughs are changed to laughs, and when
                            Our frowns melt into smiles of glee,
                            And all our blood thaws out again
                            In streams of ecstasy,
                            And poets wreak their roundelay,
                            The Spring is coming round this way.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE BOYS.
                        
                            WHERE are theythe friends of my childhood
                                enchanted?
                            The clear, laughing eyes looking back in my
                                own,
                            And the warm chubby fingers my palms have so wanted,
                            As when we raced over
                            Pink pastures of clover,
                            And mocked the quail's whirr, and
                                bumblebee's drone?
                        
                        
                            Have the breezes of time blown their blossomy faces
                            Forever adrift down the years that are flown?
                            Am I never to see them romp back to their places
                            Where over the meadow,
                            In sunshine and shadow,
                            The meadow-larks trill, and the bumble-bees
                                drone?
                        
                        
                            Where are they? Ah! dim in the dusk lies the clover;
                            The whippoorwill's call has a sorrowful
                                tone,
                            
                            And the dove'sI have wept at it over and over.
                            I want the glad luster
                            Of youth, and the cluster
                            Of faces asleep where the bumble-bees drone!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        DOC SIFERS.
                        At a Physicians' Banquet held in Indianapolis, Mr. Riley
                            responded to the Toast "Doc Sifers," as follows:
                        
                            Of all the Doctors I could cite you to in this-ere town

                            First had this doctor, what's his name, from
                                "puddlesburg," and then
                            This little red-head, "Burnin'

                            And they "consulted" on the case, and
                                claimed she'd hav to die;
                            I jes was joggin' by the place, and heerd her dorter

                                "You hop right on and ride with me!"
                            I got him there, "Well, Aunty, ten days k-yores

                            And where orchard-boughs were bent
                            Till their tawny fruitage blent
                            With the golden wake that marked the
                            Way the happy reapers went;
                            Where the dawn died into noon
                            As the May melts in June,
                            And the dusk fell like a sweet face in a swoon.
                        
                        
                            Of the South I dreamed; and there
                            Came a vision clear and fair
                            As the marvelous enchantments
                            Of the mirage of the air;
                            And I saw the bayou trees,
                            With their lavish draperies
                            Hanging heavy o'er the moon-washed cypress-knees.
                        
                        
                        
                            Peering from lush fens of rice
                            I beheld the negro's eyes,
                            Lit with the old superstition
                            Death itself cannot disguise;
                            And I saw the palm-tree nod
                            Like an oriental god,
                            And the cotton froth and bubble from the pod.
                        
                        
                            And I dreamed that North and South,
                            With a sigh of dew and drouth,
                            Blew each unto the other the
                            Salute of lip and mouth;
                            And I wakened, awed and thrilled
                            Every doubting murmur stilled
                            In the silence of the dream I found fulfilled.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        HERR WEISER.
                        
                            HERR WEISER!Three-score-years-and-ten,
                            A hale white rose of his countrymen,
                            Transplanted here in the Hoosier loam,
                            As blossomy, and as pure and sweet
                            As the cool green glen of his calm retreat,
                            Far withdrawn from the noisy town
                            Where trade goes clamoring up and down,
                            And fret and fever, and stress and strife
                            May not trouble his tranquil life!
                        
                        
                            Breath of rest, what a balmy gust!
                            Quit of the city's heat and dust,
                            Jostling down, by the winding road,
                            In the cool, green depths of his quaint abode
                            Tether the horse, as we onward fare
                            Under the pear-trees trailing there,
                            And thumping the wooden bridge at night
                            With lumps of ripeness and lush delight,
                            Till the stream, as it maunders on till dawn,
                            Is still forgiven and smiled upon.
                        
                        
                            Herr Weiser, with his wholesome face,
                            And the gentle blue of his eyes, and grace
                            Of unassuming honesty,
                            
                            Be there to welcome you and me!
                            And what though the toil of the farm be stopped,
                            And the tireless plans of the place be dropped,
                            While the prayerful master's knees are set
                            In beds of pansy, and mignonette
                            And lily and aster and columbine,
                            Offered in love, as thine and mine.
                        
                        
                            Whatbut a blessing of kindly thought,
                            Sweet as the breath of for-get-me-not!
                            What, but a spirit of lustrous love
                            White as the aster he bends above!
                            What, but an odorous memory
                            Of the dear old man, made known to me
                            In days demanding a help like his,
                            As sweet as the life of the lily is
                            As sweet as the soul of a babe, bloom-wise
                            Born of a lily in paradise.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        WHAT SHALL WE PRAY FOR.
                        
                            I.
                            WHAT shall we pray for?
                            Shall we pray
                            For health to-day
                            We who so yearn
                            For health's return,
                            And laughing hours so far away?
                            Or shall we pray
                            The long delay
                            Of fortune shall have end,
                            And wealth be ours, as when
                            Each silver night and golden day
                            Of youth was ours, my friend?
                        
                        
                            II.
                            What shall we pray for? What?
                            That the sweet clusters of forget-me-nots
                            And mignonette
                            And violet
                            Be out of childhood brought
                            And in our old hearts set
                            A-blooming now, as then?
                            
                            Or shall we pray
                            That love, long flown,
                            Return again
                            Unto its own,
                            No more to fly away?
                        
                        
                            III.
                            What shall we pray for?
                            Shall it be
                            The mother-faces we
                            Have missed for years
                            So bitterly
                            Whose eyelids would
                            Not lift, nor could
                            Be wetted open with our tears?
                            How would we greet them now!Nay, nay!
                            For what then shall we pray?
                        
                        
                            IV.
                            For what then shall we pray?
                            Praypray all self to pass away
                            Forgetful of all needs
                            Thine own
                            Neglectful of all creeds,
                            Alone
                            Stand, facing Heaven, and say:
                            To Thee,
                            O Infinite, I pray
                            Bless Thou mine enemy!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE BOY-FRIEND.
                        
                            CLARENCE, my boy-friend, hale and
                                strong!
                            O, he is as jolly as he is young,
                            And all of the laughs of the lyric belong
                            To the boy all unsung!
                        
                        
                            So I want to sing something in his behalf
                            To clang some chords for the good it is
                            To know he is near, and to have the laugh
                            Of that wholesome voice of his:
                        
                        
                            I want to tell him, in gentler ways
                            Than prose may do, that the arms of rhyme,
                            Warm and tender with tuneful praise,
                            Are about him all the time:
                        
                        
                            I want him to know the quietest nights
                            We have passed together are yet with me,
                            Roistering over the old delights
                            That were born of his company:
                        
                        
                            I want him to know how my soul esteems
                            The fairy stories of Andersen,
                            And the glad translations of all the themes
                            Of the hearts of boyish men:
                        
                        
                        
                            Want him to know that my fancy flows
                            With the lilt of a dear old-fashioned tune
                            Through " Lewis Carroll's" poemly
                                prose,
                            And the tale of the bold dragoon.
                            O, this is the Prine that I would sing
                            Would drape and garnish in velvet line,
                            Since courtlier far than any king
                            Is this brave boy-friend of mine!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        TO HEAR HER SING.
                        To hear her singto hear her sing
                        It is to hear the birds of spring
                        In dewy groves on blooming sprays
                        Pour out their blithest roundelays.
                        
                        It is to hear the robin trill
                        At morning, or the whippoorwill
                        At morning, or the whippoorwill
                        At dusk, when the stars are blossoming
                        
                        To hear her singto hear her sing !
                        To hear her sing-it is to hear
                        The laugh of childhood ringing clear
                        In woody path or grassy lane
                        Our feet may never fare again.
                        
                        Faint, far away as Memory dwells,
                        It is to hear the village bells
                        At twilight, as the truant hears
                        Them, hastening home, with smiles and tears.
                        
                        Such joy it is to hear her sing,
                        We fall in love with everything
                        The simple things of every day
                        Grow lovelier than words can say.
                        
                        
                            The idle brooks that purl across
                            The gleaming pebbles and the moss,
                            We love no less than classic streams
                            The Rhines and Arnos of our dreams.
                        
                        
                            To hear her singwith folded eyes,
                            It is, beneath Venetian skies,
                            To hear the gondolier's refrain;
                            Or troubadours of sunny Spain.
                        
                        
                            To hear the bulbul's voice that shook
                            The throat that trilled for Lalla Rookh;
                            What wonder we in homage bring
                            Our hearts to herto hear her sing.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE LITTLE FAT DOCTOR.
                        
                            HE seemed so strange to me every way
                            In manner, and ways, and size,
                            From the boy I knew but yesterday
                            I could hardly believe my eyes!
                        
                        
                            To hear his name called over there,
                            My memory thrilled with glee,
                            And laped to picture him young and fair,
                            And fresh as he used to be.
                        
                        
                            But, looking, as only glad eyes can,
                            For the boy I knew of yore,
                            I smiled on a portly little man
                            I had never seen before!
                        
                        
                            Grave as a judge, in courtliness,
                            Professor-like, and bland
                            A fat little doctor, and nothing less,
                            With his hat in his kimboed hand.
                        
                        
                            But how we talked old times, and chaffed
                            Each other, with "Minnie" and
                                "Jim!"
                            And how the little fat doctor laughed
                            And how I laughed at him!
                        
                        
                        
                            "And it's pleasant," I said,
                                "though I yearn to see
                            The face of the youth that was,
                            To know no boy could smile on me
                            As the little fat doctor does!"

                            As blurred reflections in a stream,
                            Or shadows on a window-blind,
                            Or ones in a musician's dream;
                            Or, to a wild benightmared brain,
                            The slanting sleet that whips the pane
                            Until the dreamer's pallid cheeks
                            In fearful phosphorescent streaks
                            Seem lighting all the midnight up,
                            This legend of the Iron Pup!
                        
                        
                            Frame you a fancy such as grips
                            The tendrils of a madman's sight,
                            And jerks his eyeballs left and right,
                            And lifts his hair and warps his lips
                            In all contortions of affright!
                            Breed you a vision bare and dread
                            As ghouls might, digging up the dead!
                            Evoke, from out the farthest view
                            Imagination reaches to,
                            The airiest, veriest conceit,
                            And all will fail to furnish you
                            As strange, as bitter, or as sweet
                            
                            A draught from out Oblivion's cup

                            O some may tap their heads(would they
                            Might tap their brains as well!)and say,
                            "Who sings of 'Iron Pups' must
                                be
                            A sorry dog himself, since he
                            Would fashion for a roundelay
                            A theme that lacks all melody
                            Of simple sense as well as rhyme!"
                            'Tis well I do not strive to please
                            The pups, not nine-days-old, like these
                            That whine in blindness all the time,
                            Distinguishing not friends from fleas!
                            Nay, bear with me. I offer up
                            A tribute to the Iron Pup.
                        
                        
                            We reach not dainties to the jaws
                            That snarl and snap, and drip with froth;
                            We may not love an object wroth
                            Whose anger hath not any cause.
                            But, O, a pup, with iron smile
                            Beaming upon us all the while!
                            With iron light of glad surprise
                            Forever in his iron eyes!
                            An iron elegance of pose
                            An iron stateliness of style
                            An iron browan iron nose,
                            
                            And iron legs, toe-nails and toes
                            And tail, uptilted toward the skies,
                            Of purest virgin iron ore,
                            Wagless foreverevermore!
                            Surely a pup like that might well
                            Above all pups prove lovable!
                        
                        
                            His eloquence of reticence!
                            His winkless eyes, his heartless ears,
                            His unintentional intents,
                            His fearlessness of any fears,
                            His turbulence of quietude,
                            His hopelessness of any howl,
                            Or any yowl, or growing rude,
                            Or any prowling ghost of prowl!
                            Ho! how my blood warms to recite
                            The unbat bitness of his bite!
                            And how his unwrought rabidness
                            Seemed sweet as any coy caress,
                            The while his bristles ever raised
                            Along his neck, I stroked and praised,
                            Forced by the grimness of my grim
                            Unmuzzled dream to muzzle him!
                            My full affection render up
                            Their fatness for that Iron Pup!

                            O MELLOW month and merry month,
                            Let me make love to you,
                            And follow you around the world
                            As knights their ladies do.
                            I thought your sisters beautiful,
                            Both May and April, too,
                            But April she had rainy eyes,
                            And May had eyes of blue.
                        
                        
                            And JuneI liked the singing
                            Of her lips, and liked her smile
                            But all her songs were promises
                            Of something, after while;
                            And July's facethe lights and shades
                            That may not long beguile
                            With alternations o'er the wheat.
                            The dreamer at the stile.

                            Your beauty is so rare!
                            Your eyes are clearer, deeper eyes
                            Than any, anywhere;

                            On the brazen brow that dares
                            Filch laurel that it wears:
                            Not the Donn Piatt whose praise
                            Echoes in the noisy ways
                            Of the faction, onward led

                            In its babyish delight,

                            With a light foot true-beating out the time!
                            In many a rustic reel of rhythm and rhyme
                            The homely syllables touch, with heel and toe,
                            Each note of the old tunes we used to know.
                            Silence: and hark! 'tis bells of elves
                                that chime!
                            And, backward, up the hills of morn we climb
                            To the old fairyland of long ago!
                        
                        
                            What is this charm that, through the changing speech
                            Bird-mimicked from the mouths of many men
                            Thrills like a thread of rainbow glimmerings?
                            The golden register we may not reach
                            The music of the minstrels come again
                            And yours, the master-hand of many strings!

                            I GOT to thinkin' of himas sometimes a feller will
                            Of the night he give a lectur' to the folks in
                                Shelbyville,
                            An' we set up ontil daylight, as them lecturers
                                sometimes do
                            A'talkin' of a hundred things that
                                mightn't int'rest you;
                            I mind the things he rattled off that night, in boyish
                                glee,
                            Recitations he recited to an audience of me;
                            How I laughed ontil the lan'lord come in an'
                                ast us to be still
                            So I got to thinkin' of him, an' that night
                                at Shelbyville.
                        
                        
                            Then he'd kind o' quit his nonsense,
                                an' we'd settle down a spell,
                            Tell Jim 'ud turn upon me an' begin
                                agin"Dey' tell
                            'Bout the time I went to Franklin fer the Baptist
                                College folks?"
                        
                        
                        
                            An' I'd stretch my mouth acrost my face, all
                                ready fer the jokes:
                            But he'd branch off in a story 'bout
                                "Merry Workers" band,
                            That 'nless you knowed the
                                "Workers" you c'd hardly understand;
                            I c'd hear myself a swallerin', the room
                                'ud seem so still
                            So I got to thinkin' of him, an' that night
                                at Shelbyville.
                        
                        
                            I got to thinkin' of himlike 'twas jest a
                                year ago
                            Fer time, that flies so fast in dreams, in alminicks is
                                slow;
                            He was workin' like a beaver, lecturn' here
                                an' lecturn' there,
                            An' a-writin' on railroad cars, in
                                tavernsev'ry where,
                            Printin' poems in the papers, speakin'
                                pieces at the fairs,
                            An' him and me a-travelin', now and then,
                                around in pairs;
                            An' he seemed to think 'at he was no account
                                at allbut still
                            I got to thinkin' of him an' that night at
                                Shelby-ville.
                        
                        
                        
                            I got to thinkin' of him and the happy "Days
                                gone by,"
                            Tell the sweet "Old fashioned roses" seemed
                                to bloom aginand die;
                            An' I hear him talk agin about "My bride
                                that is to be,"
                            When he'd come to "Grigsby station"
                                jest to have a night weth me;
                            I kin see him settin' down agin, to give the Prine a
                                rock,
                            When "The frost was on the punkin an' the
                                corn was in the shock,"
                            An' I hear a laughin' voice I loved, with
                                music in its trill
                            So I got to thinkin' of him, an' that night
                                at Shelbyville.
                        
                        
                            So I set here an' I wonder ef I know jest what it
                                means:
                            When I see 'em print his poetry in all the
                                magazines;
                            An' I see him on the platform with the James and
                                Howells set,
                            An' hear the people sayin',
                                "He's the best one of 'em
                                yet;"
                            An' I keep a winkin' back the tears that
                                make my fool eyes shine,
                            
                            Fer I couldn't feel no prouder ef he'd ben a
                                boy of mine;
                            Fer he's jest the same old Riley, an'
                                he'll be the same Jim still,

                            But what does that amount to when it throws
                            A feller out o' balance, and his nose
                            Gits barked against the mantle, while you hum
                            For joy around the room, and churn your head
                            Aginst the ceilin', and draw back and butt

                                some
                            Puts most their trust in Providence,
                            And takes things as they come;
                            That is, the commonality

                            Has watched the world enough to learn

                            With some, of course, it's different
                            I've seed young men that knowed it
                                all,
                            And didn't like the way things went
                            On this terrestrial ball!
                            But, all the same, the rain some way
                            Rained jest as hard on picnic-day;
                            Or when they really wanted it,
                            It maybe wouldn't rain a bit!
                        
                        
                            In this existence, dry and wet
                            Will overtake the best of men
                            
                            Some little skift o' clouds 'll shet
                            The sun off now and then;
                            But maybe, as you're wonderin' who
                            You've fool-like lent you're
                                umbrell' to,
                            And want itout 'll pop the sun,
                            And you'll be glad you ain't got none.
                        
                        
                            It aggravates the farmers, too
                            They's too much wet, or too much sun,
                            Or work, or waitin' round to do
                            Before the plowin's done;
                            And maybe, like as not, the wheat,
                            Jest as it's lookin' hard to beat,
                            Will ketch the stormand jest about
                            The time the corn's a-jintin' out!
                        
                        
                            These here cy-clones a foolin' round
                            And back'ard cropsand wind and rain
                            And yit the corn that's wallered down
                            May elbow up again!
                            They ain't no sense, as I can see,
                            Fer mortals, sich as you and me,
                            A-faultin' Nature's wise intents
                            And lockin' horns with Providence!
                        
                        
                            It ain't no use to grumble and complain;
                            It's jest as cheap and easy to
                                rejoice:
                            When God sorts out the weather and sends rain,
                            W'y, rain's my choice.

                            IN the jolly winters
                            Of the long-ago,
                            It was not as cold as now
                            O! No! No!
                            Then, as I remember,
                            Snowballs to eat
                            Were as good as apples now,
                            And every bit as sweet!

                            Bub was warm as summer,
                            With his red mitts on.
                            Just in his little waist-
                            And-pants all together,
                            Whoever heard him growl
                            About cold weather?

                            Was it half as cold as now?
                            O! No! No!
                            Who caught his death o' cold
                            Making prints of men
                            Flat-backed in snow that now's
                            Twice as cold again!

                            Starting out rabbit-hunting
                            Early as the dawn,
                            Who ever froze his fingers,

                            Corn in the skillet, and
                            Sleepin' four abed!
                            Ah! the jolly winters
                            Of the long-ago!

                            And the balance of the trees
                            Gettin' balder every breeze
                            Like the heads we're scratchin' on!
                            Old October's purt' nigh gone.
                        
                        
                            I love old October so,
                            I can't bear to see her go,

                            Old October knocks me out!
                            I sleep well enough at night
                            And the blamedest appetite

                        A POOR MAN'S WEALTH.
                        
                            A POOR man! Yes, I must confess
                            No wealth of gold do I possess;
                            No pastures fine, with grazing kine,
                            Nor fields of waving grain are mine:
                            No foot of fat or fallow land
                            Where rightfully my feet may stand,
                            The while I claim it as my own
                            By deed and title mine alone.
                        
                        
                            Ah, poor indeed! perhaps you say
                            But spare me your compassion, pray!
                            When I can't ride with you, I walk
                            In Nature's company, and talk
                            With one who will not slight or slur
                            The child forever dear to her
                            And one who answers back, be sure,
                            With smile for smile, though I am poor.
                        
                        
                            And while communing thus, I count
                            An inner wealth of large amount
                            The wealth of honest purpose blent
                            With Penury's environment
                            The wealth of owing naught to-day
                            
                            But debts that I would gladly pay,
                            And wealth of thanks still unexpressed
                            With cumulative interest.
                        
                        
                            A wealth of patience and content
                            For all my ways improvident;
                            A faith still fondly exercised
                            For all my plans unrealized:
                            A wealth of promises that still,
                            Howe'er I fail, I hope to fill;
                            A wealth of charity for those
                            Who pity me my ragged clothes.
                        
                        
                            A poor man! Yes, I must confess
                            No wealth of gold do I possess;
                            No pastures fine, with grazing kine,
                            Nor fields of waving grain are mine
                            But ah, my friend! I've wealth, no end!
                            And millionaires might condescend
                            To bend the knee and envy me
                            This opulence of poverty.

                            O THE way that Billy could ride!
                            You should hear Grandfather tell of the lad
                            For Grandfather he was a horseman, too.
                            Though he couldn't ride now as he used to do,
                            It yet was his glory and boast and pride,
                            That he'd "back" Billy for all he
                                had
                            And that's a cool million, I'll say to
                                you!
                            And you should hear him, with all his praise
                            Of this boy Billy, and his wild ways;
                            The way that he handled a horse, and the way
                            He rode in town on election day
                            The way he bantered, and gaffed, and guyed,
                            And the ways he swopped, and the ways he lied,
                            And the way he'd laugh at his victims grim,
                            Till half of the time they would laugh with him,
                            Forgetting their anger, and pacified
                            Seeing the way Billy could ride!
                        
                        
                            II.
                            Billy was born for a horse's back!
                            That's what Grandfather used to say:
                            He'd seen him, in dresses, a-many a day,
                            
                            On a two-year-old, in the old barn lot,
                            Prancing around, with the bridle slack,
                            And his two little sunburnt legs outshot
                            So straight from the saddle-seat you'd swear
                            A spirit-level had plumbed him there;
                            And all the neighbors that passed the place
                            Would just haul up in the road, and stare
                            To see the little chap's father boost
                            The boy up there on his favorite roost,
                            To canter off, with a laughing face,
                            Put him up there, he was satisfied
                            And O the way Billy could ride!
                        
                        
                            III.
                            At celebration or barbecue
                            And Billy, a boy of fifteen years,
                            Couldn't he cut his di-does there?
                            What else would you expect him to,
                            On this little dimity chestnut mare,
                            With her slender neck, and her pointed ears,
                            And the four little, devilish hoofs of hers?
                            The "delegation" moved too slow
                            For the time that Billy wanted to go!
                            And to see him dashing out of the line,
                            At the edge of the road, and down the side
                            Of the long procession, his horse wild-eyed
                            At the fife and drums, was a sight divine
                            To the girls, in their white-and-spangled pride,
                            
                            In the great "Big Wagon" all gilt
                                outside
                            And jolt within, as they lumbered on
                            Into the town where Billy had gone
                            An hour ahead, like a knightly guide
                            O, but the way that Billy could ride!
                        
                        
                            IV.
                            "Billy can ride! O, Billy can ride!
                            But what on earth can he do beside?"
                            That's what the farmers used to say,
                            As time went by a year at a stride,
                            And Billy was twenty if he was a day!
                            And many a wise old father's foot
                            Was put right down where it should be put,
                            While many a dutiful daughter sighed
                            In vain for one more buggy-ride
                            With the gallant Billy, who none the less
                            Smiled at the old man's selfishness,
                            And kissed his daughter, and rode away,
                            Till one especially rich old chap
                            Noted for driving a famous bay
                            Gave poor Billy so sharp a rap
                            Regarding his daughter, that Billy replied
                            By noising it over the country wide,
                            That the old curmudgeon was simply mad
                            Because he (Billy) undoubtedly had
                            A faster horse than the famous bay,
                            And that was all that he had to say!
                        
                        
                        
                            Then he'd touch his horse in the flank, and-zipp!
                            Talk about horses and horsemanship!
                            Folk stare after him just wall-eyed!
                            Oomh! the way that Billy could ride!
                        
                        
                            V.
                            Bang the cymbals! and thump the drum!
                            Stun the guineas! and pound the gong!
                            Mr. Bull, git up and come!
                            And beller and paw for five days long!
                            Whoop and howl till you drown the band
                            That hoots and toots in the "Judges'
                                Stand!"
                            For this is the term of the county fair,
                            And you bet Billy will be there!
                            And you watch him there, old horsemen, all!
                            And judges, you, in your lifted stall!
                            And gamblers, you, as you clap and clack,
                            As the order is heard to clear the track!
                            And watch him, you, by the "Floral
                                Hall,"
                            With sweet face pink as the parasol
                            You wave as you stand on the buggy-seat!
                            And you, young man, as you feel her hand
                            Tremble in yours, as there you stand!
                            And watch him, too, you old man gray,
                            With your houses, lands, and your wealth complete
                            Not forgetting the famous bay
                            
                            You ride with him in the race to-day!
                            And lash, as you start there side by side!
                            Lash! for the sake of your bay defied!
                            Lash! for the proof of your boasted pride!
                            Lash! as you'd lash a cur that lied!
                            Lash! but watch him with both eyes wide
                            For O the way that Billy can ride.
                        
                        
                            VI.
                            Side by side in the open track
                            The horses stoodsuch a glossy pair!
                            Trim as sparrows about to fly
                            Plumage of mane and song of eye!
                            Ho! They were beautiful!bay and black
                            The sunshine glittered along each back
                            Glanced at the shoulders, and flickered and run
                            In dapples of light that would daze the sun!
                            The veins of their limbs like tremulous vines
                            The breeze blows through, and the vibrant lines
                            Of their nostrils like to the lips of the cups
                            Of the gods, brimmed over with roseate sups
                            From swish of tail to the toss of mane,
                            Pharao's favorites lived again!
                            Lived, and served, and nobly, too.
                            As they sprung to the race, and onward flew!
                            Ho! but the sight of them side by side!
                            Their masters' faces seemed glorified
                            As they flashed from viewin an instant gone,
                            
                            And as you saw but their shoulders, as they rode on
                            Narrowingnarrowingless and less
                            As you gazed after in breathlessness.
                        
                        
                            VII.
                            Shoulder to shoulder, and neck to neck
                            And the hearts of the crowd spun round with them
                            As they dwindled away to the self-same speck
                            When suddena flashlike the flash of a gem
                            That had dropped in the dust, while onward came
                            But one wild rider, who homeward led,
                            So mad with delight that he shrieked his name
                            And it was not "Billy"but all the same,
                            Though far behind, he was far ahead!
                            As the one rode in on "his famous bay,"
                            His gray hair steaming beneath his hat,
                            And the wind-blown, upturned brim of that
                            Flat on his foreheadwas no acclaim,
                            The crowd was looking the other way!
                            Where, far in the distance, and through the mist
                            Of the dust you saw where a hand was kissed
                            As in hasty adieunor was that all,
                            But, fairly and clearly and sharply defined,
                            You saw the black horse, with Billy astride,
                            With a sweet little witch of a woman behind,
                            Gaily waving a pink parasol,
                            
                            And the crowd answered roundly with cheer upon cheer,
                            As the horse lightly wheeled with their manifold weight,
                            And dashed from your gaze through the big lower gate,
                            While back down the track, midst a tumult of jeers,
                        
                        
                            Was seen to rack out, on a "winded"
                                bay,
                            An aged parentamazedirate
                            On a race that might not end for years
                            But end it did. * * * "Who won the
                                race?"
                            Grandfather paused, with a graver face,
                            "Well, Billy wonbut the reason why,
                            Was the bay was 'blowed'and so was I!
                        
                        
                            "Fizzles in everything else he's tried
                            But O the way Billy can ride!"

                            WHO shall sing a simple ditty all about the
                                willow,

                            That dandles high the happy bird that flutters there to trill
                                a
                            Tremulously tender song of greeting to the May?
                        
                        
                            Ah, my lovely willow! Let the waters lilt your graces,
                            They alone with limpid kisses love your leaves
                                above,
                            Flashing back your bonny beauty, and in shady places
                            Peering up with glimmering pebbles like the eyes of
                                love.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        ON THE BANKS OF DEER CRICK.

                        AN ANSWER TO RILEY'S "DEER CRICK."
                        It is coming to be pretty generally conceded that Indiana people are
                            capable of excellent work in all kinds of literature, and particularly
                            in poetry. It is not to be denied that there is very much poetry written
                            by Indiana writers that is not good; indeed, some of it is very bad. But
                            that is true of the literary people of all parts of the world. Out of
                            the mass that is constantly tumbling into the hopper of the daily and
                            weekly press there is much that is worthy of preservation. Writing verse
                            seems to come as natural to many Indianians as to write anything, and to
                            do it well. It is so easy, some think. It is too easy for some. But,
                            altogether, the people of the Hoosier State have no reason to be ashamed
                            of the productions of their favorites. An incident happened, recently,
                            illustrative of the facility with which the aver-age native of Indiana
                            turns to poetry. Mr. James Whit-comb Riley had been to lecture at some
                            town in the Kankakee region, probably at Kentland, and after his
                            departure his auditors got to discussing the merits of his productions,
                            excerpts from which he had read to make up his entertainment. There were
                            those who regarded him as a genius, while others were as firmly
                            persuaded that his work was "just as easy," and any
                            one could make the same kind of verse ad lib. His dialect, while it
                            stirred up a good deal of admiration, was regarded as something that any
                            properly-constituted man could duplicate on order. To put it to the
                            test, one of his auditors set himself about doing a little,
                            "just for a joke," going home and finishing up the
                            poem before he retired for the night. That he did not make a failure of
                            it altogether may be seen from the following, which is the poem he
                            produced:
                        
                        
                            Talk about yer Deer Crick, that will do to tell;
                            That there Hoosier poet likes it purty well;
                            See's his shadder in it; thinks he's purty,
                                too
                            That there kind o' lookin'-glass
                                can't be very true;
                            Tells us 'bout his fishin', a mile or two
                                from town,
                            Where half the little town chaps are alus loafin'
                                roun';
                            Had to go on Sunday, way off the creek,
                            Jes' to taste o' pleasures we have all the
                                week.
                            But talkin' 'bout yer Deer creek,
                                an' where yer rather be
                            Think if I was choosin' I'd say the
                                Kankakee.
                        
                        
                            Long about September, when the leaves are color-in'
                                fine,
                            Some a-turnin' yaller and some as red as wine;
                            Bayous full o' lilies, ferns a-growin'
                                rank,
                            Goldenrods a-bloomin' all along the bank;
                            River full o' salmon, black haws gittin good;
                            Crows a holdin' meetin' over in the

                                matinees;

                                slow,
                            As though it had ter leave ye but didn't want ter
                                go.
                            
                            Jes' take yer boat and paddle to some secluded
                                place,
                            Where the shadder of the birches, with the sun, is
                                weavin' lace:
                            Then, if yer bent on fishin', jes' bait yer
                                hook an' fish,
                            An', if yer not too graspin', ye'll
                                soon get all ye wish:
                            But, if yer only recreatin', jes'
                                a-runnin' 'way from care;
                            If yer mind is full o' trouble, it'll surely
                                suit you there;
                            For ye kind o' git to musin', kind
                                o' lose yer-self, it seems,
                            An' yer mind it goes a-wand'rin'
                                sort o' like it does in dreams,
                            Till the sunlight fades to twilight, an' ye paddle
                                back to camp,
                            With the moonlight on the water in the evenin' cool
                                and damp.
                        
                        
                            Then take it after supper, when ev'rything is
                                still,
                            'Ceptin' little tree toads an' the
                                lonesome whipperwill;
                            An' ye lounge, an' smoke, an'
                                ponder till way long in the night
                            Within the magic circle o' the camp-fire blazing
                                bright,
                            
                            While a feelin' o' contentment steals on ye
                                unawares,
                            Lifts from yer tired shoulders the knapsack of yer cares;
                            Soothes from yer brow the wrinkles, the crowfeet from yer
                                eyes,
                            An' ye sleep the sleep o' childhood beneath
                                the autumn skies.
                            Talk about yer Deer Creek, it kind o' seems to me
                            That the Hoosier poet never seen the land o'
                                Kankakee.
                        
                        There are crudities in it, as might have been expected; but on the whole
                            it is a production of which the author has no reason to be ashamed. He
                            is evidently laboring under a delusion, if he thinks any one can write
                            such articles "off-hand." If he does, let him try it
                            himself again, or, better, get some of his neighbors to try it. He will
                            discover that the machine won't work in that easy and graceful
                            manner every time. He may learn that he himself can't duplicate
                            it. If he can, he should be at it, for there is a grace, and rhythm, and
                            flow about it that reveals the true poetic instinct. The gentleman to
                            whom credit should be given for this poem is Mr. William W. Pfrimmer, of
                            Kentland, who is represented to be a great lover of nature, well
                            acquainted with all her ways. "Ho, for the swales of the
                            Kankakee!"

                            For the sake of the past we know,
                            When we were vagrants along the road,
                            Yet glad as the skies were blue;
                            When we struck hands, as in alien lands
                            Old friend to old friend is revealed,
                            And each hears a tongue that he understands,
                            And a laugh that he loves, Dave Field.
                        
                        
                            Ho! Let me chant you a stave, Dave Field,
                            Of those indolent days of ours,
                            With our chairs a-tilt at the wayside inn,
                            On our backs in the woodland flowers;
                            With your pipe a-lit, and the breath of it
                            Like a nimbus above your head,
                            While I sipped, like a monk, of your winey wit,
                            With my matins all unsaid.
                        
                        
                            Let me drone you a dream of the world, Dave Field,
                            And the glory it held for us
                            You with your pencil and canvas dreams,
                            And I with my pencil thus;
                            
                            Yet with never a thought of the prize we sought Being at best
                                but a pain
                            As we looked from the heights and our blurred eyes caught
                            The scenes of our youth again.
                        
                        
                            O, let me sing you a song, Dave Field,
                            Jolly and hale, but yet
                            With a quaver of pathos along the lines,
                            And the throb of a vain regret;
                            A sigh for the dawn long dead and gone,
                            But a laugh for the dawn concealed,
                            As bravely awhile we still toil on
                            Toward the topmost height, Dave Field.

                            MY Mary! O, my Mary!
                            The simmer skies are blue;
                            The dawnin' brings the dazzle,
                            And the gloamin' brings the dew,
                            The murk o' nicht the glory
                            O' the moon, and kindles, too,
                            The stars that shift about the lift,
                            But naething brings me you!
                        
                        
                            Where is it, O, my Mary,
                            Ye are bidin' a' the while?
                            I ha' wended by your window
                            I ha' waited at the stile,
                            And up and down the river
                            I ha' rowed for mony a mile,
                            Yet never found, adrift or drown'd,
                            Your lang-belated smile.
                        
                        
                            Is it forgot, my Mary,
                            How glad we used to be?
                            The simmertime when bonny
                            Bloomed the auld trysting-tree
                            How there I carved a name for you,
                            And you a name for me;
                            
                            And the twilight kenned it only
                            When we kissed sae tenderly.
                        
                        
                            Speak aince to me, my Mary!
                            But whisper in my ear
                            As light as any sleeper's breath
                            And a' my soul will hear;
                            My heart shall stap its beating,
                            And the soughing atmosphere
                            Be hushed the while I leaning smile
                            And listen to you, dear!
                        
                        
                            My Mary! O, my Mary!
                            The blossoms bring the bees,
                            The sunshine brings the blossoms
                            And the leaves upon the trees;
                            The simmer brings the sunshine,
                            And the fragrance of the breeze,
                            But O, without you, Mary
                            I care naething for these!
                        
                        
                            We were sae happy, Mary!
                            O think how aince we said,
                            Wad ane o' us gang fickle,
                            Or ane o' us were dead,
                            To feel another's kisses
                            We wad feign the auld instead,
                            And ken the ither's footsteps
                            In the grass aboon the head.
                        
                        
                        
                            My Mary! O, my Mary!
                            Are ye sister o' the air,
                            That ye vanish aye before me
                            As I follow everywhere?
                            Or is it that ye're only
                            But a mortal, wan wi' care,

                            With thy swollen palms, and roar
                            As thou never hast before!

                            Stiflest? Squat and grind thy heel
                            Wrestle with thy loins, and then

                            Tiptoe up and pour thy mirth
                            Sloshingly around the earth
                            For a wallow-slough for thee
                            To swash round inHi! whoop-ee!

                        THE OLD SWIMMIN'-HOLE.
                        
                            OH! the old swimmin'-hole! where
                                the crick so still and deep
                            Looked like a baby-river that was laying half asleep,
                            And the gurgle of the worter round the drift jest below
                            Sounded like the laugh of something we one'st ust to
                                know
                            Before we could remember anything but the eyes
                            Of the angels lookin' out as we left paradize;
                            But the merry days of youth is beyond our controll,
                            And it's hard to part forever with the old
                                swimmin'-hole.
                        
                        
                            Oh! the old swimmin'-hole! In the happy days of
                                yore,
                            When I ust to lean above it on the old sickamore,
                            Oh! it showed me a face in its warm sunny tide
                            That gazed back at me so gay and glorified,
                            It made me lose myself, as I leaped to caress,
                            My shadder smilin' up at me with such tenderness.
                            
                            But them days is past and gone, and old Time's tuck
                                his toll
                            From the old man come back to the old
                                swimmin'-hole.
                        
                        
                            Oh! the old swimmin'-hole! In the long, lazy
                                days,
                            When the hum-drum of school made so many run-a-ways,
                            How pleasant was the jurney down the old dusty lane,
                            Where the tracks of our bare feet was all printed so plain
                            You could tell by the dent of the heel and the sole
                            They was lots o' fun on hands at the old
                                swimmin'-hole.
                            But the lost joys is past! Let your tears in sorrow roll
                            Like the rain that ust to dapple up the old
                                swimmin'-hole.
                        
                        
                            There the bullrushes growed, and the cat-tails so tall,
                            And the sunshine and shadder fell over it all,
                            And it mottled the worter with amber and gold
                            Till the glad lillies rocked in the ripples that rolled,
                            
                            And the snake-feeder's four gauzy wings fluttered
                                by
                            Like the ghost of a daisy dropped out of the sky,
                            Or a wownded apple-blossom in the breeze's
                                controll
                            As it cut acrost some orchard to'rds the old
                                swimmin'-hole.
                        
                        
                            Oh! the old swimmin'-hole! When I last saw the
                                place
                            The scenes was all changed, like the change in my face;
                            The bridge of the railroad now crosses the spot
                            Where the old divin'-log lays sunk and forgot.
                            And I stray down the banks where the trees ust to be
                            But never again will their shade shelter me!
                            And I wish in my sorrow I could strip to the soul
                            And dive off in my grave like the old
                                swimmin'-hole!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        WRITTEN IN JOHN BOYLE O' REILLY'S "IN

                            SINGERS there are of courtly themes
                            Drapers in versewho would dress their rhymes
                            In robes of ermine; and singers of dreams,
                            Of gods high-throned, in the classic times;
                            Singers of nymphs, in their dim retreats,
                            Satyrs, with sceptre and diadem;
                            But the singer who sings as a man's heart beats,
                            May well blush for the rest of them.
                        
                        
                            I like the thrill of such poems as these,
                            All spirit and fervor of splendid fact
                            Pulse, and muscle, and arteries
                            Of living, heroic thought and act!
                            Where every line is a vein of red
                            And rapturous blood all unconfined
                            As it leaps from a heart that has joyed and bled
                            With the rights and the wrongs of all mankind.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        GRANT.
                        AT RESTAUGUST 8, 1885.
                        
                            Read at the Memorial Meeting at Delphi, Ind.
                        
                        Sir Lancelot rode overthwart and endlong in a wide forest, and held no
                            path but as wild adventure led him.  And he returned and came
                            again to his horse, and took off his saddle and his bridle, and let him
                            pasture; and unlaced his helm, and ungirdled his sword, and laid him
                            down to sleep upon his shield before the cross.Age of
                                Chivalry.
                        
                        
                            WHAT shall we say of the soldier, Grant,
                            His sword put by and his great soul free?
                            How shall we cheer him now or chant
                            His requiem befittingly?
                            The fields of his conquest are now seen
                            Ranged no more with his armed men
                            But the rank and file of the gold and green
                            Of the waving grain is there again.
                        
                        
                            Though his valiant life is a nation's pride,
                            And his death heroic and half divine,
                            And our grief as great as the world is wide,
                            There breaks in speech but a single line:
                            We loved him living, revere him dead!
                            A silence then on our lips is laid:
                            
                            We can say no thing that has not been said,
                            Nor pray one prayer that has not been prayed.
                        
                        
                            But a spirit within us speaks, and lo,
                            We lean and listen to wondrous words
                            That have a sound as of winds that blow,
                            And the voice of waters, and the low of herds;
                            And we hear, as the song flows on serene
                            The neigh of horses, and then the beat
                            Of hoofs that skurry o'er pastures green,
                            And the patter and pad of a boy's bare
                                feet.
                        
                        
                            A brave lad, wearing a manly brow,
                            Knit as with problems of grave dispute,
                            And a face, like the bloom of the orchard bough,
                            Pink and pallid, but resolute;
                            And flushed it grows as the clover-bloom,
                            And fresh it gleams as the morning dew,
                            And he reins his steed where the quick quails boom
                            Up from the grasses he races through.
                        
                        
                            And ho! as he rides what dreams are his?
                            And what have the breezes to suggest?
                            Do they whisper to him of shells that whizz
                            
                            O'er fields made ruddy with wrongs
                                redressed?
                            Does the hawk above him an eagle float?
                            Does he thrill and his boyish heart beat high,
                            Hearing the ribbon about his throat
                            Flap as a flag as the winds go by?
                        
                        
                            And does he dream of the warrior's fame
                            This Western boy in his rustic dress?
                            For, in miniature, this is the man that came
                            Riding out of the Wilderness!
                            The self-same figurethe knitted brow
                            The eyes full steadythe lips full mute
                            And the face, like the bloom of the orchard bough,
                            Pink and pallid, but resolute.
                        
                        
                            Aye, this is the man, with features grim
                            And stoical as the Sphink's own,
                            That heard the harsh guns calling him,
                            As musical as the bugle blown;
                            And the sweet spring weather was clouded o'er
                            With a tempest glowering and wild,
                            And our country's flag bowed down before
                            Its bursting wrath as a stricken child.
                        
                        
                            Thus ready mounted, and booted, and spurred,
                            He loosed his bridle and dashed away!
                            
                            Like a roll of drums were his hoof-beats heard,
                            Like the shriek of the fife his charger's
                                neigh!
                            And over his shoulder and backward blown,
                            We heard his voice, and we saw the sod
                            Reel, as our wild steeds chased his own,
                            As though hurled on by the hand of God!
                        
                        
                            And still, in fancy, we see him ride,
                            In the blood-red front of a hundred frays,
                            His face set stolid but glorified
                            As a knight's of the old Arthurian
                                days:
                            And victor ever as courtly, too,
                            Gently lifting the vanquished foe,
                            And staying him with a hand as true
                            As dealt the deadly avenging blow.
                        
                        
                            So, brighter than all the cluster of stars
                            Of the flag enshrouding his form to-day,
                            His face shines forth from the grime of wars
                            With a glory that shall not pass away:
                            He rests at last: he has borne his part
                            Of salutes and salvos and cheers on cheers
                            But O, the sobs of his country's heart,
                            And the driving rain of a nation's
                                tears!
                        
                        
                            Soldiers! look on his face the last,
                            With never a tremble of lip or lid;
                            
                            Look on the hero, as you file past,
                            And front his foe as your leader did
                            For still you may see, in the deepest dole
                            And the darkest night of your discontent,
                            The great white light of his loyal soul
                            Ablaze in the midmost firmament.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE BAT.
                        
                            I.
                            THOU dread, uncanny thing,
                            With fuzzy breast and leathern wing,
                            In mad, zigzagging flight,
                            Notching the dusk, and buffeting
                            The black cheeks of the night,
                            With grim delight
                        
                        
                            II.
                            What witch's hand unhasps
                            Thy keen claw-cornered wings
                            From under the barn roof, and flings
                            Thee forth, with chattering gasps,
                            To rend the air,
                            And nip the lady-bug, and tear
                            Her children's hearts out unaware?
                        
                        
                            III.
                            The glow-worm's glimmer, and the bright,
                            Sad pulsings of the fire-fly's light,
                            Are banquet lights to thee.
                            O less than bird, and worse than beast,
                            Thou Devil's self, or brat, at least,
                            Grit not thy teeth at me!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE SOUTH WIND AND THE SUN.
                        
                            O THE South Wind and the Sun!
                            How each loved the other one
                            Full of follyfull of fancy
                            Full of foolishness and fun!
                            How they romped and ran about,
                            Like two boys when school is out,
                            With glowing face, and lisping lip
                            Low laugh and lifted shout!
                        
                        
                            And the South Windhe was dressed
                            With a ribbon round his breast
                            That floated, flapped and fluttered
                            In a riotous unrest,
                            And a drapery of mist,
                            From the shoulder and the wrist
                            Flowing backward with the motion
                            Of the waving hand he kissed.
                        
                        
                            And the Sun had on a crown
                            Wrought of gilded thistle-down,
                            And a scarf of velvet vapor,
                            And a raveled rain-bow gown;
                            And his tinsel-tangled hair,
                            Tossed and lost upon the air,
                            
                            Was glossier and flossier
                            Than any anywhere.
                        
                        
                            And the South Wind's eyes were two
                            Little dancing drops of dew,
                            As he puffed his cheeks, and pursed his lips,
                            And blew and blew;
                            And the Sun'slike diamond-stone,
                            Brighter yet than ever known,
                            As he knit his brows and held his breath,
                            And shone and shone and shone!
                        
                        
                            And this pair of merry fays
                            Wandered through the summer days;
                            Arm-in-arm they went together
                            Over heights of morning haze
                            Over slanting slopes of lawn
                            They went on and on and on!
                            Where the daisies looked like star-tracks
                            Trailing up and down the dawn.
                        
                        
                            And where'er they found the top
                            Of a wheat-stalk droop and lop,
                            They chucked it underneath the chin
                            And praised the lavish crop,
                            Till it lifted with the pride
                            Of the heads it grew beside,
                            And then the South Wind and the Sun
                            Went onward satisfied.
                        
                        
                        
                            Over meadow-lands they tripped
                            Where the dandelions dipped
                            In crimson foam of clover-bloom,
                            And dripped and dripped and dripped,
                            And they clinched the bumble-stings,
                            Gauming honey on their wings
                            And bundling them in lily-bells,
                            With maudlin murmurings.
                        
                        
                            And the humming-bird that hung
                            Like a jewel up among
                            The tilted honeysuckle-horns,
                            They mesmerized, and swung
                            In the palpitating air,
                            Drowsed with odors strange and rare,
                            And, with whispered laughter, slipped away,
                            And left him hanging there.
                        
                        
                            And they braided blades of grass
                            Where the truant had to pass;
                            And they wriggled through the rushes
                            And the reeds of the morass,
                            Where they danced, in rapture sweet,
                            O'er the leaves that laid a street
                            Of undulating mosaic
                            For the touches of their feet.
                        
                        
                            By the brook with mossy brink,
                            Where the cattle came to drink,
                            
                            They trilled and piped and whistled
                            With the thrush and bobolink,
                            Till the kine, in listless pause,
                            Switched their tails in mute applause,
                            With lifted heads, and dreamy eyes,
                            And bubble-dripping jaws.
                        
                        
                            And where the melons grew,
                            Streaked with yellow, green and blue,
                            These jolly sprites went wandering
                            Through spangled paths of dew;
                            And the melons here and there,
                            They made love to, everywhere,
                            Turning their pink souls to crimson
                            With caresses fond and fair.
                        
                        
                            Over orchard walls they went,
                            Where the fruited boughs were bent
                            Till they brushed the sward beneath them
                            Where the shine and shadow blent;
                            And the great green pear they shook
                            Till the sallow hue forsook
                            Its features, and the gleam of gold
                            Laughed out in every look.
                        
                        
                            And they stroked the downy cheek
                            Of the peach, and smoothed it sleek,
                            And flushed it into splendor;
                            
                            And with many an elfish freak,
                            Gave the russet's rust a wipe
                            Prankt the rambo with a stripe,
                            And the winesap blushed its reddest
                            As they spanked the pippins ripe.
                        
                        
                            Through the woven ambuscade
                            That the twining vines had made
                            They found the grapes, in clusters,
                            Soaking up the shine and shade
                            Plumpt, like tiny skins of wine,
                            With a vintage so divine
                            That the tongue of fancy tingled
                            With the tang of muscadine.
                        
                        
                            And the golden-banded bees,
                            Droning o'er the flowery leas,
                            They bridled, reined, and rode away
                            Across the fragrant breeze,
                            Till in hollow oak and elm
                            They had groomed and stabled them
                            In waxen stalls that oozed with dews
                            Of rose and lily-stem.
                        
                        
                            Where the dusty highway leads,
                            High above the wayside weeds,
                            They sowed the air with butterflies
                            Like blooming flower-seeds,
                            
                            Till the dull grasshopper sprung
                            Full a man's height up, and hung
                            Tranced in the heat, with whirring wings,
                            And sung and sung and sung!
                        
                        
                            And they loitered hand in hand,
                            Where the snipe along the sand
                            Of the river ran to meet them
                            As the ripple meets the land;
                            And the dragonfly, in light
                            Gauzy armor, burnished bright,
                            Came tilting down the waters
                            In a wild, bewildered flight.
                        
                        
                            And they heard the killdee's call,
                            And afar, the waterfall,
                            But the rustle of a falling leaf
                            They heard above it all;
                            And the trailing willow crept
                            Deeper in the tide that swept
                            The leafy shallop to the shore
                            And wept and wept and wept!
                        
                        
                            And the fairy vessel veered
                            From its mooringstacked and steered
                            For the center of the current
                            Sailed away and disappeared:
                            And the burthen that it bore
                            
                            From the long-enchanted shore
                            "Alas! The South Wind and the Sun!"
                            I murmur evermore.
                        
                        
                            For the South Wind and the Sun,
                            Each so loves the other one,
                            For all his jolly folly
                            And his foolishness and fun,
                            That our love for them they weigh
                            As their fickle fancies may,
                            And when at last we love them most,
                            They laugh and sail away.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        AN IMPROMPTU ON ROLLER SKATES.
                        
                            RUMBLE, tumble, growl and grate!
                            Skip, and trip, and gravitate!
                            Lunge and plunge, and thrash the planks
                            With your blameless, shameless shanks!
                            In excruciating pain,
                            Stand upon your head again,
                            And uncoiling kink by kink,
                            Kick the roof out of the rink!
                        
                        
                            In derisive bursts of mirth,
                            Drop kawhoop and jar the earth!
                            Jolt your lungs down in your socks,
                            O, tempestuous equinox
                            Of dismembered legs and arms!
                            Strew your ways with wild alarms;
                            Fameward skoot and ricochet
                            On your glittering vertebrae.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE LAW OF THE PERVERSE.
                        
                            Where did the custom come from, anyway!
                            Sending the boys to "play" at
                                dinner-time,
                            When we have company? What is there, pray,
                            About the starched, unmalleable guest
                            That, in the host's most genial
                                interest,
                            Finds him first favor on Thanksgiving Day,
                            Beside the steaming turkey, with its wings
                            Akimbo over all the savory things
                            It has been stuffed with, yet may never thus
                            Make one poor boy's face glad and
                                glorious!
                        
                        
                            Fancy the exiled boy in the back-yard,
                            An-hungered so that any kind of grub
                            Were welcome, yet with set face, stern and hard,
                            Hearing the feasters' laugh and mild
                                hubbub,
                            And wanting to kill something with a club!
                            Intuitively arguing the unjust
                            Distinction, as he naturally must,
                            The guest with all the opportunity,
                            And he with all the appetite. Ah, me!
                        
                        
                            So is it that when I, a luckless guest,
                            Am thus arraigned at banquet, I sit grim
                            
                            And sullen, eating nothing with a zest,
                            With smirking feature, yet a soul distressed,
                            Missing the banished boy and envying him
                            Aye, longing for a spatter on my vest
                            From his deflecting spoon, and yearning for
                            The wild whoop of his lips insatiate, or
                            The burning corruscations of his eyes
                            Bulged like dead-ripe stars in paradise.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        GOD BLESS US EVERY ONE.
                        
                            "GOD bless us every one!"
                                prayed Tiny Tim
                            Crippled and dwarfed of body, yet so tall
                            Of soul we tiptoe earth to look at him,
                            High towering over all.
                        
                        
                            He loved the loveless world, nor dreamed, indeed,
                            That it, at best, could give to him the while
                            But pitying glances, when his only need
                            Was but a cheery smile.
                        
                        
                            And thus he prayed "God bless us every
                                one!"
                            Enfolding all the creeds within the span
                            Of his child-heart, and so, despising none,
                            Was nearer saint than man.
                        
                        
                            I like to fancy God in Paradise,
                            Lifting a finger o'er the rhythmic
                                swing
                            Of chiming harp and song, with eager eyes
                            Turned earthward listening.

                            O, PINCHING-BUG! When life was young,
                            Ere love into my heart had sung,
                            I fled whene'er I heard your tune
                            And loathed you for your dismal croon
                            As buzzing round the lamp you hung!
                        
                        
                            Then, if into my hair you clung,
                            Or down my neck, in gambols swung,
                            Forthwith I fell into a swoon,
                            O, pinching-bug!
                        
                        
                            But nowah, me! with altered tongue
                            I bless the source from which you sprung;
                            For out beneath the summer moon
                            My dear and I must stray and spoon,
                            While you are from the window flung,
                            O, pinching-bug!

                        HER BEAUTIFUL EYES.
                        
                            O HER beautiful eyes! they are blue as the dew
                            On the violet's bloom when the morning is new,
                            And the light of their love is the gleam of the sun
                            O'er the meadows of spring where the quick shadows
                                run,
                            As the morn shifts the mists and the clouds from the skies,
                            So I stand in the dawn of her beautiful eyes.
                        
                        
                            And her beautiful eyes are as midday to me,
                            When the lily-bell bends with the weight of the bee,
                            And the throat of the thrush is a-pulse in the heat,
                            And the senses are drugged with the subtle, and sweet,
                            And delirious breaths of the air's lullabies,
                            So I swoon in the noon of her beautiful eyes.
                        
                        
                            O her beautiful eyes! they have smitten mine own
                            As a glory glanced down from the glare of the Throne;
                            
                            And I reel, and I falter and fall, as afar
                            Fell the shepherds that looked on the mystical Star,
                            And yet dazed in the tidings that bade them arise,
                            So I grope through the night of her beautiful eyes.

                            The wintry fagot piled beside
                            The chimney wide

                            Gleams i' the dusk as in thy dusky hair
                            The snowy blossom glimmers, or the shine
                            Of thy swift smile.Ah Lady!lady mine!

                            With lifted wrist where round the laughing air
                            Hath blown a mist of lawn and claspt it there,
                            Waft finger-tipt adieus that spray the wine
                            Of thy waste kisses towr'd me, lady mine!

                            With thy hand's unfurled glory anywhere!
                            
                            What glint of sun, or dew, or jewel fine
                            May mate thine eyes?Ah, Ladylady mine,

                            My soul confronts thee; on thy brow and hair
                            It lays its gentleness like palms of prayer;
                            It touches sacredly those lips of thine
                            And swoons across thy spirit, lady mine,
                            The while thou lingerest there.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE BEST IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME.
                        
                            I QUARREL not with Destiny,
                            I make the best of everything
                            The best is good enough for me.
                        
                        
                            Leave Discontent alone, and she
                            Will shut her mouth and let you sing,
                            I quarrel not with Destiny.
                        
                        
                            I take some things, or let 'em be
                            Good gold has always got the ring;
                            The best is good enough for me.
                        
                        
                            When Fate insists on secrecy,
                            I have no arguments to bring
                            I quarrel not with Destiny.
                        
                        
                            The fellow that goes "haw" for
                                "gee"
                            Will find he hasn't got full swing.
                            The best is good enough for me.
                        
                        
                            One only knows our needs, and He
                            Does all of the distributing.
                            I quarrel not with Destiny;
                            The best is good enough for me.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        MY FRIEND.
                        
                            "HE is my friend," I
                                said
                            "Be patient!" Overhead
                            The skies were drear and dim;
                            And lo! the thought of him
                            Smiled on my heartand then
                            The sun shone out again!
                        
                        
                            "He is my friend!" the words
                            Brought summer and the birds;
                            And all my winter-time
                            Thawed into running rhyme
                            And rippled into song,
                            Warm, tender, brave and strong.
                        
                        
                            And so it sings to-day
                            So may it sing alway!
                            Though waving grasses grow
                            Between, and lilies blow
                            Their trills of perfume, clear
                            As laughter to the ear,
                            Let each mute measure end
                            With "Still he is thy friend!"
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE HARPER.
                        
                            Like a drift of faded blossoms
                            Caught in a slanting rain,
                            His fingers glimpsed down the strings of his harp
                            In a tremulous refrain.
                        
                        
                            Patter, and tinkle, and drip, and drip!
                            Ah! but the chords were rainy sweet!
                            And I closed my eyes and I bit my lip
                            As he played there in the street.
                        
                        
                            Patter, and drip, and twinkle!
                            And there was the little bed
                            In the corner of the garret,
                            And the rafters overhead!
                        
                        
                            And there was the little window
                            Tinkle, and drip, and drip!
                            The rain above, and a mother's love,
                            And God's companionship!
                        
                    
                
                
                
                    FACTS AND FANTASTICS
                    
                    
                        ONE AFTERNOON.
                        
                            BELOW, cool grasses. Over us
                            The maples waver tremulous.
                        
                        
                            A slender overture above,
                            Low breathing as a sigh of love
                        
                        
                            At first, then gradually stronger
                            And stronger. 'Tis a locust's song,
                        
                        
                            Swol'n midway to a paean of glee,
                            And lost in silence dwindingly
                        
                        
                            Not utter silence; nay, for hid
                            In ghosts of it, the Katydid
                        
                        
                            Chirrs a diluted echo of
                            The loveless song he makes us love.
                        
                        
                            The low boughs are drugged heavily
                            With shade. The poem you read to me
                        
                        
                            Is not more gracious than the trill
                            Of birds that twitter as they will.
                        
                        
                            Half consciously, with upturned eyes,
                            I hear your voiceI see the skies.
                        
                        
                        
                            Where, o'er bright rifts, the swallows glance
                            Like glad thoughts o'er a countenance;
                        
                        
                            And voices near and far are blent
                            Like sweet chords of some instrument
                        
                        
                            Awakened by the trembling touch
                            Of hands that love it over much.
                        
                        
                            Dear heart, let be the book awhile!
                            I want your faceI want your smile!
                        
                        
                            Tell me how gladder now are they
                            Who look on us from heaven to-day.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        A TRANCIENT DENTAL MONODY.
                        
                            I HAIL thee, thou regal profession
                            O Dentistry! Queen as thou art!
                            How can I extract the expression
                            That aches in my innermost heart?
                            My mirror-like mind's necromancy
                            Reflects itbut ah! when I fain
                            Would nip it, the forceps of fancy
                            Slip off and my efforts are vain!
                        
                        
                            I loll back and breathe of thy presence
                            As patients of laughing-gasnay,
                            This last is an impotent essence
                            Compared with thy worth anyway!
                            Like bibulous paper my spirit
                            Drinks of thee until I become
                            As weak as the moisture, or near it,
                            That slowly exudes from the gum.
                        
                        
                            There's a cavity in my affection
                            Impatiently waiting thy skill
                            Thy coffer-dam's tender protection,
                            And the rasp of each requisite drill.
                            
                            Like a patient I come to thee, trusting
                            My feelings most sensitive shoots,
                            With a tartar deposit encrusting
                            My being's indefinite roots.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE ASSASSIN.
                        
                            FLING him amongst the cobbles of the
                                street,
                            Midmost along a mob's most turbid tide;
                            Stun him with tumult upon every side
                            Wrangling of hoarsened voices that repeat
                            His awful guilt and howl for vengeance meet;
                            Let white-faced women stare, all torrid-eyed,
                            With hair blown forward, and with jaws dropped wide,
                            And some face like his mother's glimmer sweet
                            An instant in the hot core of his eyes.
                            Then snatch him with claw hands, and thong his head
                            That he may look no way but toward the skies
                            That glower lividly and crackle red
                            There let some knuckled fist of lightning rise
                            Draw backward flickeringly and knock him dead.
                        
                    
                
                
                
                    PROSE
                    
                    
                        THE GILDED ROLL.
                        NOSING around in an old boxpacked away and lost to
                            memory for yearsan hour ago, I found a musty package of gilt paper, or,
                            rather, a roll it was, with the tarnished gold of the old sheet for the
                            outer wrapper. I picked it up mechanically to toss it into some obscure
                            corner, when, carelessly lifting it by one end, a child's tin
                            whistle fell tinkling on the cellar floor. It lies before me on my
                            writing table nowand so, too, does the roll entire, though now a roll no
                            longer, for my eager fingers have rent the gilded covering, and all its
                            precious contents are spread out beneath my hungry eyes.
                        Here is a scroll of ink-written music. I don't read music, but I
                            know the dash and swing of the pen that raised it on the page. Here is a
                            letter, with the self-same impulse and abandon in every syllable, and
                            its melodyhowever sweet the otheris far more sweet to me. And here are
                            other letters like itthreefiveand seven, at least. Bob wrote them from
                            the front, and Billy kept them for me when I went to join him. Dear boy!
                            Dear boy!
                        
                        Here are some cards of bristol-board. Ah! when Bob came to these there
                            were no blotches then. What faceswhat expressions! The droll,
                            ridiculous, good-for-nothing genius, with his "sad
                            mouth," as he called it, "upside down,"
                            laughing alwaysat everything, at big rallies, and mass meetings and
                            conventions, county fairs and floral balls, booths, watermelon wagons,
                            dancing tents, the swing, daguerreian car, the "lung
                            barometer," and the air-gun man. Oh! what a gifted,
                            good-for-nothing boy Bob was in those old days. And here's a
                            picture of a girlish facea very faded photographeven fresh from
                            "the gallery," four-and-twenty years ago, it was a
                            faded thing. But the facehow bright and clear that was; for
                            "Doc," Bob's awful name for her, was a pretty
                            girl, and brilliant, clever, lovable every way. No wonder Bob fancied
                            her! And you could see some hint of her jaunty loveliness in every fairy
                            face he drew, and you could find her happy ways and dainty tastes
                            unconsciously assumed in all he didthe books he read the poems he
                            admired, and those he wrote; and, ringing clear and pure and jubilant,
                            the vibrant beauty of her voice could clearly be defined and traced
                            through all his music. Now, there's the happy pair of themBob
                            and "Doc." Make of them just whatever your good fancy
                            may  dictate, but keep in mind the stern,
                            relentless ways of destiny.
                        You are not at the beginning of a novel, only at the threshold of one of
                            a hundred experiences that lie buried in the past, and this particular
                            one most happily resurrected by these odds and ends found in the gilded
                            roll.
                        You see, the contents of this package, mainly, were hastily gathered
                            together after a week's visit out to the old Mills farm. The
                            gilt paper, and the whistle, and the pictures, they were
                            Billy's; the music pages, Bob's, or
                            "Doc's;" the letters and some other MSS. were
                            mine.
                        The Mills girls were great friends of "Doc's,"
                            and often came to visit her in town; and so "Doc"
                            often visited the Mills's. This is the way that Bob first got
                            out there, and won them all, and "shaped the thing"
                            for me, as he would put it; and lastly, we had lugged in Billy,such a
                            handy boy, you know, to hold the horses on picnic excursions, and to
                            watch the carriage and the luncheon, and all that. "Yes,
                            and," Bob would say, "such a serviceable boy in
                            getting all the fishing tackle in proper order, and digging bait, and
                            promenading in our wake up and down the creek all day, with the
                            minnow-bucket hanging on his arm, don't you know?"
                        But jolly as the days were, I think jollier were  the long evenings at the farm. After the supper in the
                            grove, where, when the weather permitted, always stood the table,
                            ankle-deep in the cool, green plush of the sward; and after the lounge
                            upon the grass, and the cigars, and the new fish stories, and the
                            general invoice of the old ones, it was delectable to get back to the
                            girls again, and in the old "best room" hear once more
                            the lilt of the old songs and the stacattoed laughter of the piano
                            mingling with the alto and falsetto voices of the Mills girls, and the
                            gallant soprano of the dear girl "Doc."
                        This is the scene I want you to look in upon, as, in fancy, I do nowand
                            here are the materials for it all, husked from the gilded roll.
                        Bob, the master, leans at the piano now, and "Doc" is
                            at the keys, her glad face often thrown up sidewise toward his own. His
                            face is boyishfor there is yet but the ghost of a mustache upon his lip.
                            His eyes are dark and clear, of over-size when looking at you; but now
                            their lids are drooped over his violin whose melody has, for the time,
                            almost smoothed away the upward kinkings of the corners of his mouth.
                            And wonderfully quiet now is every one, and the chords of the piano,
                            too, are low and faltering; and so, at last, the tune itself swoons into
                            the universal hush, andBob is rasping in its stead the ridiculous  but marvelously perfect imitation of the
                            "priming" of a pump, while Billy's hands
                            forget the "chiggers" on the bare backs of his feet,
                            as, with clapping palms, he dances round the room in ungovernable spasms
                            of delight. And then we all laugh; and Billy, taking advantage of the
                            general tumult, pulls Bob's head down and whispers,
                            "Git 'em to stay up 'way late
                            to-night!" And Bob, perhaps remembering that we go back home
                            to-morrow, winks at the little fellow and whispers, "You let me
                            manage 'em! Stay up till broad daylight if we take a
                            notioneh?" And Billy dances off again in newer glee, while the
                            inspired musician is plunking a banjo imitiation on his enchanted
                            instrument, which is unceremoniously drowned out by a circus tune from
                            "Doc" that is absolutely inspiring to every one but
                            the barefoot brother, who drops back listlessly to his old position on
                            the floor and sullenly renews operations on his
                            "chigger" claims.
                        "Thought you was goin' to have pop-corn tonight all so
                            fast!" he says doggedly, in the midst of a momentary lull that
                            has fallen on a game of whist. And then the oldest Mills girl, who
                            thinks cards stupid anyhow, says, "That's so, Billy,
                            and we're going to have it, too; and right away, for this
                            game's just ending, and I shan't  submit to being bored with another. I say
                            'popcorn' with Billy! And after that," she
                            continues, rising and addressing the party in general, "we must
                            have another literary and artistic tournament, and that's been
                            in contemplation and preparation long enough; so you gentlemen can be
                            pulling your wits together for the exercises, while us girls see to the
                            refreshments."
                        "Have you done anything toward it?" queries Bob, when
                            the girls are gone, with the alert Billy in their wake.
                        "Just an outline," I reply. "How with
                            you?"
                        "Clean forgot itthat is, the preparation; but I've got
                            a little old second-handed idea, if you'll all help me out with
                            it, that'll amuse us some, and tickle Billy, I'm
                            certain."
                        So that's agreed upon; and while Bob produces his portfolio,
                            drawing paper, pencils and so on, I turn to my note-book in a dazed way
                            and begin counting my fingers in a depth of profound abstraction from
                            which I am barely aroused by the reappearance of the girls and
                            Billy.
                        Goody, goody, goody! Bob's goin' to make
                            pictures!" cries Billy, in additional transport to that the
                            pop-corn has produced.
                        "Now, you girls," says Bob, gently detaching the
                            affectionate Billy from one leg and moving  a chair to the table, with a backward glance of intelligence toward
                            the boy, "you girls are to help us all you can, and we can all
                            work, but, as I'll have all the illustrations to do, I want you
                            to do as many of the verses as you canthat'll be easy, you
                            know,because the work entire is just to consist of a series of
                            fool-epigrams, such as, for instance,
                        
                            Here lies a young man
                            Who in childhood began
                            To swear, and to smoke, and to drink,
                            In his twentieth year
                            He quit swearing and beer,
                            And yet is still smoking, I think.
                        
                        And the rest of his instructions are delivered in lower tones, that the
                            boy may not hear; and then, all matters seemingly arranged, he turns to
                            the boy with,"And now, Billy, no lookin' over
                            shoulders, you know, or swinging on my chair-back while I'm at
                            work. When the pictures are all finished, then you can take a squint at
                            'em, and not before. Is that all hunky, now?"
                        "Oh! who's a-goin' to look over your
                            shoulderonly 'Doc?'" And as the radiant
                            "Doc" hastily quits that very post, and dives for the
                            offending brother, he scrambles under the piano and laughs
                            derisively.
                        And then a silence falls upon the groupa 
                            gracious quiet, only intruded upon by the very juicy and exuberant
                            munching of an apple from a remote fastness of the room, and the
                            occasional thumping of a bare heel against the floor.
                        At last I close my note book with a half slam.
                        "That means," says Bob, laying down his pencil, and
                            addressing the girls,"That means he's concluded his
                            poem, and that he's not pleased with it in any manner, and that
                            he intends declining to read it, for that self-acknowledged reason, and
                            that he expects us to believe every affected word of his entire
                            speech"
                        "Oh, don't!" I exclaim.
                        "Then give us the wretched production, in all its hideous
                            deformity!"
                        And the girls all laugh so sympathetically, and Bob joins them so gently,
                            and yet with a tone, I know, that can be changed so quickly to my future
                            discomfiture, that I arise at once and read, without apology or excuse,
                            this old scrap that I pick here to-day from The Gilded Roll:
                        
                            A BACKWARD LOOK.
                            As I SAT smoking, alone, yesterday,
                            And lazily leaning back in my chair,
                            Enjoying myself in a general way
                            Allowing my thoughts a holiday
                            From weariness, toil and care,
                            
                            My fanciesI guess, for ventilation
                            Left ajar the gates of my mind,
                            And Memory, seeing the situation,
                            Slipped out in street of "Auld Lang
                                Syne."
                        
                        
                            Wandering ever with tireless feet
                            Through scenes of silence, and jubilee
                            Of long-hushed voices; and faces sweet
                            Were thronging the shadowy sides of the street
                            As far as the eye could see;
                            Dreaming again, in anticipation,
                            The same old dreams of our boyhood's
                                days
                            That never come true, from the vague sensation
                            Of walking asleep in the world's strange
                                ways.
                        
                        
                            Away to the house where I was born!
                            And there was the self-same clock that ticked
                            From the close of dusk to the burst of morn,
                            When life-warm hands plucked the golden corn,
                            And helped when the apples were picked.
                            And the "china dog" on the mantel-shelf,
                            With the gilded collar and yellow eyes,
                            Looked just as at first, when I hugged myself
                            Sound asleep with the dear surprise.
                        
                        
                            And down to the swing in the locust tree,
                            Where the grass was worn from the trampled
                                ground;
                            And where "Eck" Skinner,
                                "Old" Carr, and three
                            Or four such other boys used to be,
                            Doin' "sky-scrapers,"
                                or "whirlin' round:"
                            
                            And again Bob climbed for the bluebird's nest
                            And again "had shows " in the
                                buggy-shed
                            Of Guymon's barn, where still, unguessed,
                            Old ghosts romp of the best days dead!
                        
                        
                            And again I gazed from the old school-room
                            With a wistful look, of a long June day,
                            When on my cheek was the hectic bloom
                            Caught of Mischief, as I presume
                            He has such a "partial "
                                way,
                            It seemed, toward me,And again I thought
                            Of a probable likelihood to be
                            Kept in after school,for a girl was caught
                            Catching a note from me
                        
                        
                            And down through the woods to the swimming-hole
                            Where the big, white, hollow, old sycamore
                                grows,
                            And we never cared when the water was cold,
                            And always " ducked " the boy that told
                            On the fellow that tied the clothes,
                            When life went so like a dreamy rhyme,
                            That it seems to me now that then
                            The world was having a jollier time
                            Than it ever will have again.
                        
                        The crude production is received, I am glad to note, with some
                            expressions of favor from the girls; but Bob, of course, must
                            heartlessly dissipate my weak delight by saying, "Well,
                            it's certainly bad enough; though," he goes on with an
                                 air of deepest critical sagacity and
                            fairness, "considered, as it should be justly, as the
                            production of a jour poet, why, it might be worse that is, a little
                            worse." But, by this time, the girls, in a body, are
                            suppressing him, to which he laughingly submits and calls for quarter,
                            declaring that he would have been inclined to have ventured no comment
                            whatever, but for the very personal allusion of the poem to his boyish
                            derelictions and youthful eccentricities. "And now,"
                            he says, when order is restored, "our other production needs
                            attention, and, with our new reinforcement, we can, with diligence, soon
                            have it ready for both printer and engraver, and then we'll
                            wake up the boy (who I notice has been fortunately slumbering for the
                            last quarter of an hour), and present to him, as designed and intended,
                            this matchless creation of our united intellects." At the
                            conclusion of this speech we all go good-humoredly to work, and at the
                            close of half an hour the tedious, but most ridiculous, task is
                            announced completed.
                        As I arrange and place in proper form here on the table the separate
                            cardstwenty-seven in numberI sigh to think that I am unable to
                            transcribe for you the best part of the nonsensical workthe
                            illustrations. All I can give you is the written copy of
                        
                        
                            BILLY'S ALPHABETICAL ANIMAL SHOW.
                            
                                A WAS an elegant Ape
                            Who tied up his bangs with red tape,
                            And wore a long veil,
                            Half revealing his tail,
                            Which was trimmed with jet bugles and crape.
                        
                        
                            
                                B was a boastful old Bear
                            Who used to say,"Hoomh! I declare
                            I can eatif you'll get me
                            The children, and let me
                            Ten babies, teeth, toenails and hair!"
                        
                        
                            
                                C was a Codfish who sighed
                            When snatched from the home of his pride,
                            But could he, embrined,
                            Guess this fragrance behind,
                            How glad he would be that he died!
                        
                        
                            
                                D was a dandified dog
                            Who said,"Though it's raining
                                like fog
                            I wear no umbrellah,
                            Me boy, for a fellah
                            Might just as well travel incog!"
                        
                        
                            
                                E was an elderly Eel
                            Who would say,"Well, I really feel
                            As my grandchildren wriggle
                            And shout 'I should giggle'
                            A trifle run down at the heel!"
                        
                        
                            
                                F was a Fowl who conceded
                            Some hens might hatch more eggs than she did,
                            
                            But she'd children as plenty
                            At eighteen or twenty,
                            And that was quite all that she needed.
                        
                        
                            
                                G was a gluttonous Goat
                            Who, dining one day, table-d'hote,
                            Ordered soup-bone, au fait,
                            And fish, papier mache,
                            And a fillet of spring overcoat.
                        
                        
                            
                                H was a high-cultured Hound
                            Who could clear forty feet at a bound;
                            And a coon once averred
                            That his howl could be heard
                            For five miles and three-quarters around.
                        
                        
                            
                                I was an Ibex ambitious
                            To dive over chasms auspicious;
                            He would leap down a peak
                            And not 'light for a week
                            And swear that the jump was delicious.
                        
                        
                            
                                J was a Jackass who said
                            He has such a bad cold in his head,
                            If it wasn't for leaving
                            The rest of us grieving,
                            He'd really rather be dead.
                        
                        
                            
                                K was a profligate Kite
                            Who would haunt the saloons every night;
                            And often he ust
                            To reel back to his roost
                            Too full to set up on it right.
                        
                        
                        
                            
                                L was a wary old Lynx
                            Who would say,"Do you know what I
                                thinks?
                            I thinks ef you happen
                            To ketch me a-nappin'
                            I'm ready to set up the drinks!"
                        
                        
                            
                                M was a merry old Mole
                            Who would snooze all day in his hole,
                            Thenall night, a-rootin'
                            Around and galootin'
                            He'd sing, "Johnny, fill up the
                                Bowl!"
                        
                        
                            
                                N was a caustical Nautilus
                            Who sneered, "I suppose, when
                                they've caught all us,
                            Like oysters they'll serve us,
                            And can uspreserve us
                            And barrel, and pickle, and bottle us."
                        
                        
                            
                                O was an autocrat Owl
                            Such a wisesuch a wonderful fowl!
                            Why, for all the night through
                            He would hoot and hoo-hoo,
                            And hoot and hoo-hooter and howl!
                        
                        
                            
                                P was a Pelican pet
                            Who gobbled up all he could get;
                            He could eat on until
                            He was full to the bill,
                            And there he had lodgings to let!
                        
                        
                            
                                Q was a querulous Quail,
                            Who said, "It will little avail
                            
                            The efforts of those
                            Of my foes who propose
                            To attempt to throw salt on my tail."
                        
                        
                            
                                R was a ring-tailed Raccoon,
                            With eyes of the tinge of the moon,
                            And his nose a blue-black,
                            And the fur on his back
                            A sad sort of sallow maroon.
                        
                        
                            
                                S is a Sculpinyou'll wish
                            Very much to have one on your dish,
                            Since all his bones grow
                            On the outside, and so
                            He's a very desirable fish.
                        
                        
                            
                                T was a Turtle of wealth,
                            Who went round with particular stealth,
                            "W'y," said he,
                                "I'm afraid
                            Of being waylaid
                            When I even walk out for my health!"
                        
                        
                            
                                U was a Unicorn curious,
                            With one horn, of a growth so luxurious,
                            He could level and stab it
                            If you didn't grab it
                            Clean through you, he was so blamed furious!
                        
                        
                            
                                V was a vagabond Vulture
                            Who said, "I don't want to
                                insult yer,
                            But when you intrude
                            Where in lone solitude
                            I'm a-preyin', you're no man of
                                culture!"
                        
                        
                        
                            
                                W was a wild Woodchuck,
                            And you can just bet that he could
                                "chuck"
                            He'd eat raw potatoes,
                            Green corn and tomatoes,
                            And tree roots, and call it "good
                                chuck!"
                        
                        
                            
                                X was a kind of X-cuse
                            Of some-sort-o'-thing that got loose

                            And cage it, and tame it,
                            And bring it in general use.

                            As a petrified lump of starlight,
                            Or a handful of lightning
                            Bugs, squeezed in the tight'ning

                            Yet neither devising

                            years are spread between me and that happy night? And is it possible

                        MRS. ROBERT J. BURDETTE.
                        WE who read that Mrs. Burdette is dead are very
                            thoughtless. We listen to the birds this morning; and the gilding of the
                            sunshine on the blossoms and the leaves is simply just the alchemy our
                            selfishness demands, and we are pleased to say "this is a very
                            pleasant world to us!" Some of us say this because we want to
                            forget the mother that went away a year ago, and tried to speak but
                            could not; for that the lips were dry and framed no thing, although they
                            writhed and writhed with the great yearning of their love. Some say it
                            is because the sister, when she went, was very poor, and had no legacy
                            at all to leave, only her virtue and old maidenhood, and the
                            strangely-vague daguerreotype of the one whose lie made all her life an
                            empty album in which no line was writ by any friend. Some say it is
                            because they blindly think this agony will never come to thembut, all
                            the same, some day the hammer on the anvil will ring drearthe twitter of
                            the blithest bird will hurt the hearing, and the lightest laughter of
                            the sweetest child will be an awful discord that will jar and clang and
                            ache on every sense.
                        
                        The woman that is dead is past all this. That is her rapture and her joy.
                            God is blessing her just as He has been blessing her for years and
                            years. As it happens, I knew her here; also her husband, He is not a
                            "funny-man" to-day, nor was he very funny when, but a
                            few weeks ago, at his own home, he asked the writer, one Sunday morning,
                            if he would join the family in morning service. The scene is here and it
                            is all very plain: The invalid bolstered in her chair, her sister at her
                            side, and the boy he has laughingly called "the
                            Prince" for her sake, leaning on her knee. Words grow very
                            tired trying to say how sweet and perfect it all was. But the very funny
                            man, I remember, held the Bible on his knees and read from it in a way
                            that sometimes he was not a funny man at all, but thought serious things
                            and even was capable of having tears in his eyes and blessings on his
                            head, showered, both, from the palms of God. Come from this with me, and
                            read from the pen of the woman, who will never, with her poor, crippled
                            hands, write one other line:
                        "Out of the cloud-folds of her garments shaken, nature trails
                            the soft, soft blossoms of the snow, from grey sky to brown earth.
                            Softly, softly, the snow comes down, and in my heart the sun still
                            shines. Sweet peace is there. The  strong
                            right hand of His righteousness is about me; underneath me are the
                            Everlasting arms. Always I hear in my heart His words, 'Abide
                            with me.' I am waiting for the post to come across the river
                            with the message"
                        This is the woman who is dead to-day, the wife of the funny-man.
                    
                    
                    
                        A WHOLESALE POET.
                        The Astonishing experience of JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY at Kalamazoo.
                        While the Nye-Riley combination was on the road last winter, a little
                            incident happened at Kalamazoo, Mich., which has never been given to the
                            public. Their entertainment was over for the night, and a large and
                            pleased audience had dispersed. Nye had been taken in hand by the town
                            lecture committee and towed off up to Uncle Asa Butterfield's
                            house to hear Uncle Asa tell his famous story about his red cow and Dunk
                            Brown's hired man, the occurrence having actually taken place
                            in 1839. Uncle Asa was a local humorist of great renown; he had been
                            unable to attend the lecture on account of rheumatism, but had promised
                            to sit up till the committee brought Nye around. The Red Cow story was
                            his master-piece, and he was very anxious that Nye should hear it, as he
                            thought that very likely he might want to introduce it into his lecture.
                            Riley had escaped by feigning sickness as soon as the visit was
                            proposed, and before Nye could employ the same excuse, and  was sitting in the hotel office at about
                            11 o'clock, congratulating himself and chuckling quietly. He
                            was thinking of various facetious remarks which he would make to Nye
                            should he survive the operation he was undergoing, about Uncle Asa, the
                            red cow, the hired man, and so forth, when a man hurriedly entered who
                            attracted his attention at once. The man was tall and angular, with
                            long, grey hair, hollow eyes; and he had a trick of thrusting his head
                            forward and pointing with a long, bony finger. He glanced around at the
                            group of hotel guests sitting about and walked directly to Riley.
                        "You are Riley, James Whitcomb Riley," he said as he
                            pointed a long finger at him.
                        The poet blushed slightly, and modestly admitted the fact. "Yes,
                            yes," went on the man, "I knew you though I never saw
                            you before. We never met, but we've had a good deal of business
                            with each other."
                        "Well, perhaps," replied Riley, "but I
                            don't exactly understand what you refer to."
                        "Hah? I'll tell you. My name is Thomas H.
                            Stockwell," and he looked at Riley triumphantly.
                        "Erwell, I can't just place you, I'm
                            afraid," answered Riley.
                        
                        "You can't? Why, I'm the man that has written
                            all your poetry for you!"
                        The poet looked at the hollow-eyed visitor speechless.
                        "Yes, sir, gentlemen," went on the intruder, swinging
                            his long bony hands so as to include the little group, "I am
                            the man who has written all of James Whitcomb Riley's poems for
                            him. When he has wanted a new one he has always written to me and I have
                            sent it to him and got my pay for it, and that has been all there is
                            about it. You know it, Mr. Riley, as well as I do. But I'm sick
                            and tired of it. Hereafter, sir, the world shall know Thomas H.
                            Stockwell as he is; the fame of James Whitcomb Riley will hereafter rest
                            on the brow of Thomas Hostetter Stockwell. The time is come for me to
                            declare myself and claim my own!"
                        The unknown poet who had blushed unseen all these years drew himself up
                            proudly and laid his hand on his heart. Riley had been gradually getting
                            over his astonishment, and now found his voice.
                        "Perhaps, Mr. Stockwell," he said, "you may
                            have some of your poems with you such as you have been furnishing me and
                            can favor us with a short reading."
                        
                        "Certainly," replied the long-haired individual, as he
                            pulled a handful of crumpled manuscript out of his breast pocket;
                            "certainlynothing would give me more pleasure. I have here
                            among others, one entitled 'The Old Barnyard' with
                            which I intended filling out your next order. I will read one verse:

                        "You will excuse me, gentlemen, for giving you but one verse, as
                            I want you to attend the reading I shall give in the hall to-morrow

                            "When the stock is in the stable, and

                        "That is all I will give you to-night, gentlemen, but it is

                            reading tomorrow evening will be most entertaining, and as I wrote all
                            of Mr. Longfellow's poems, and am constantly shipping poems to
                            Mr. Lowell, you can see that it will be varied as well. Lately I have

                                 This is all done away with, however,
                            and Thomas H. Stockwell reveals his true self to the world. Do not
                            forget my entertainment to-morrow"
                        "Tom," said a man, as he entered and touched the poet
                            on the shoulder, "come onit is long past time that you were in,
                            and I have been looking everywhere for you. I hope he hasn't
                            disturbed you, gentlemen," he continued, as he started toward
                            the door, followed by the other; "he is perfectly harmless, so
                            we allow him about the asylum grounds, but we didn't think
                            he'd wander away. It is the same man who used to think the
                            world would cease to revolve around the sun if he didn't wear a
                            green ribbon on his hat, but he has given up that and taken to
                            poetry." Nye came in, a moment later, very much exhaused by
                            Uncle Asa's cow-and-hired-man story, but he had to help Riley
                            up to bed.
