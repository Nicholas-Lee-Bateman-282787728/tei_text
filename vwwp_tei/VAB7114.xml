                <p><hi>THE</hi> first oneâthe very first one? Well, I think it was a sallow,
                    under-sized Italian with handsome ox-eyes, who used to give us violin lessons;
                    or else it was a cousin, a boy with sandy hair, who stammered, and who was
                    reading for the army; but, no, I rather think it was the anxious young doctor,
                    who came when I had the measlesâanyhow,<pb n="10" xml:id="VAB7114-005"/> he, the
                    primeval one, is lost in the mists of antiquity...</p>
                <p>A great many people come to our house, and they have always done so as long as I
                    can recollect. Father is a Royal Academician, and paints shocking bad portraits,
                    but the British public is quite unaware of the fact. The British public likes to
                    be painted by a Royal Academician, so it pays large prices and is hung on the
                    line in the big room at Burlington House. They all come; red-faced, red-coated
                    M.F.H.'s, the bejewelled wives of Manchester millionaires, young beauties, heads
                    of colleges, the celebrities of the dayâthey all sit, with the same fixed eyes
                    and the same tight smile, on the dais in our gorgeous studio.</p>
                <p>The studio is an imposing room. Father likes me to sit in the alcove with the
                    golden mosaics, on a peach-coloured divan, with turquoise-blue cushions; and on
                    Show Sunday Christina is seen in a little white gown in the oaken gallery,
                    playing dreamy voluntaries on the organ.... It looks idyllic, and nobody knows
                    that there has usually been a family row shortly before the people begin
                    crowding in. Christina is tart of tongue, and is not to be put<pb n="11" xml:id="VAB7114-006"/> down by a mere parent. But I was speaking of the
                    studio. There is a perfection of detail about the vast apartment which is
                    impressive; indeed, so fascinating a workshop has father fashioned for himself,
                    that I have seen a dozen people inspecting the brocades and spindle-legged
                    tables, and forgetting to look at the pictures on the easels. The over-worked
                    critics, too, about the beginning of April, are apt to gush inordinately over a
                    Nankin bowl full of daffodils, while they turn their backs on a portrait that
                    has taken the best part of a year to paint. We live in a nest of artists. Next
                    door they paint Oriental subjects, and hire a dusky Arabâmore or less
                    genuineâwho wears a turban, and opens the front door at tea-parties. A dozen
                    yards farther up the street they supply the thoroughly English idylâyoung ladies
                    in white muslin sitting on September lawns; young gentlemen in riding-breeches,
                    who are either accepted or rejected. Just opposite they do sea-picturesâthe old
                    woman shading her eyes with her hand; the young woman in despair, with the
                    careless infant at her knee. And all the houses are of red brick, with gables
                    and<pb n="12" xml:id="VAB7114-007"/> white-wood balconies, and queer little
                    windows in unexpected places. Our front doors are painted a pale sea-green, with
                    brass knockers and bell-handles. On Show Sunday the British public wanders in
                    and out, sublimely ignorant of whether it is in the house of Smith, R.A., or
                    Robinson, A.R.A. And yet ours is the only studio with an Organ.</p>
                <p>During the season we give Sunday dinner-parties, followed by an open evening, and
                    we also entertain the âsittersâ at lunch. Some of the sitters have been known to
                    want to hear me play the violin. I play execrably, but they are too polite to
                    say so. All this rather bores Christina, whose latest hobbyâSocialismâtakes up
                    most of her time.</p>
                <p>Christina can be, on occasion, almost brutally cynical; but then she is clever,
                    and when I want to get out of a scrape I go to her. Mother would not be of the
                    faintest use under such circumstances. She would get pink and flurried, and tell
                    me âthat she married my father at seventeen, and settled down after that,â and
                    would further inform me that she had âno patience with such philandering.â Poor
                    mother, I really pity her limited experience.<pb n="13" xml:id="VAB7114-008"/>
                    .. It must be like eternally dining off roast mutton to marry at seventeen, and
                    settle down dully and respectably for the rest of your natural life!</p>
                <p>I was christened Margaret, but most people call me Peggy. It is a curious fact
                    that all my friends call me by different names. Some call me Miss Wynman, others
                    Margaret; while âMiss Peggyâ and âPeggyâ do duty more often. One young manâbut
                    he was an Americanâalways addressed me as âPeggy Wynmanââa form of appellation,
                    by-the-bye, which usually prefaced a lecture. Gilbert Mandell called me
                    Marguerite.</p>
                <p>Gilbert Mandell is one of the âdear departed.â Not that he is dead. Oh no! I call
                    them the âdear departedâ when it is all over, and they have betaken themselves
                    to India, or Japan, or the East End to work among the People.</p>
                <p>It is not flattering to one's vanity, but it must be frankly owned that, as a
                    rule, my admirers âdepartâ with phenomenal celerity. Their devotion generally
                    lasts from six weeks to three months. Why this thing should be I cannot tell.
                    Some people say it is because I don't let them talk about themselves.</p>
                <pb n="14" xml:id="VAB7114-009"/>
                <p>I really think Christina objected less to Gilbert Mandell than to any of those
                    who have come after him. If he savoured slightly of the prig, she maintained, he
                    was neither a knave nor a fool. Christina doesn't care for young men.</p>
                <p>My principal objection to him was that he was associated in my imagination with
                    drains. Of course one cannot help the particular way in which one's parent has
                    made a fortune, but, considering his son's taste for smart society and
                    intellectual pursuits, it was thoughtless of Mandell <foreign xml:lang="fre">pÃ¨re</foreign> to poke his âDeodorising Powderâ in one's eye at every turn.
                    Poor young man, how he must have suffered! âMandell's superior pink carbolic
                    disinfectant powderâ screamed at you, so to speak, at every street corner. The
                    legend of its multifarious virtues was writ large on every omnibus. It flared,
                    in connection with a plump lady in full ball costume, from every hoarding.</p>
                <p>Of course there were lots of people, even when he was at Cambridge, who knew
                    nothing of the Deodoriser. But it always hung, like a modern sword of Damocles,
                    over poor Gilbert's head. It made him diffident where he should<pb n="15" xml:id="VAB7114-010"/> have been at ease; it made him malicious when it
                    would have been to his social advantage to appear kindly. But even at Cambridge
                    he had given unmistakable signs of being a Superior Person. He could repeat, to
                    a nicety, the shibboleth of Superior People. He knew when to let fall a damaging
                    phrase about the poetical fame of Mr. Lewis Morris, and when to insinuate a
                    paradox about the great and only Stendhal. In art, he generally spoke of
                    Velasquez and Degas; in music, only the tetralogies at Bayreuth were worth
                    discussion.</p>
                <p>Mr. Mandell was a pessimist. That was what attracted me first, for at seventeen a
                    girl is always impressed by any cynical man of the world who will notice her.
                    And Gilbert Mandell noticed me a good deal. He said I was âsuggestiveââwhatever
                    that meantâand that my mind was âreceptive.â And then he began to lend me books
                    by Mr. Walter Pater, which I remember perplexed me very much. He also sent me
                    George Meredith's novels; and there was even a volume of Schopenhauer, I
                    remember, which I used to pretend I had read.</p>
                <pb n="16" xml:id="VAB7114-011"/>
                <p>In appearance he was a middle-sized man of thirty-four, with rather pink cheeks,
                    and a slightly bald forehead. His hands were fleshy and white, and had
                    exquisitely pared and polished nails. A manicure usually attended to his hands.
                    He always had the newest scandal; and sometimes, when he was going to say
                    something specially malicious, he hesitated a little in his speech, not from any
                    false shame, but because he was so delighted with what he was going to say. For
                    the rest, he was always beautifully dressed, and generally affected fashions
                    which were coming in. He had two secret ambitions: to dine with a duchess, and
                    to write an article in the <title>Contemporary Review</title>.</p>
                <p>Looking back at it now, it strikes me that Gilbert Mandell had quaint notions
                    about amusing a young girl. He used to take us for long afternoons at the South
                    Kensington Museum, where we gazed at Persian tiles, and Japanese ivories, and
                    illuminated missals until my eyes ached, and Christina roundly declared she
                    wouldn't stay another minute. Then Gilbert would look at us from under his
                    drooping eyelids with a surprised little stare. He was never tired of art. And
                    how Christina was<pb n="17" xml:id="VAB7114-012"/> bored! She came from a stern
                    sense of duty, and because, as she frankly said, the âthing wouldn't do.â Poor
                    Christina, she was destined to see many such as Mr. Gilbert Mandell come and go.
                    Other days it would be the National Galleryâhe never went inside modern
                    exhibitions of pictures in Londonâwhere I learnt a good deal about Velasquez and
                    Holbein and Franz Hals. It is from that period that my suspicion dates that
                    father does not know how to paint pictures.</p>
                <p>He came to our house a good deal. Father laughed at his clothes and his manners,
                    but said he was a âsharp fellowâ; while mother was amused with his little
                    stories about smart society, into which, by great assiduity, he had managed to
                    effect a sort of entrance. In Mayfair they knew nothing of the Deodoriser.
                    Mandell senior lived in a mansion in Surrey, where he cultivated orchids and
                    pineapples, and the world knew nothing of him. The son, on the other hand, had
                    charming rooms in St. James's, where he gave frequent tea-parties, which were
                    sparsely attended by a handful of modish women, interlarded with thin,
                    youngish-old men, who spent their lives criticising the<pb n="18" xml:id="VAB7114-013"/> critics, and whose claim to immortality lay in a
                    memoir of Lamb or Coleridge. Somehow or other, these parties were not hilarious.
                    The elements did not mix, and Mr. Mandell was a somewhat flurried, nervous host.
                    The day that an ambassadress came to tea his distraction was almost painful.
                    Gilbert Mandell was an example of that extremely modern mixture, a man of
                    fashion and a critic; indeed, his respect for smart women was only equalled by
                    his adoration for the log-rollers of the <title>Saturday Review</title>.</p>
                <p>I have never made out to this day why he noticed me. Christina says he must have
                    had a depraved taste for school-girls, or else he thought by taking the raw
                    material of a woman, so to speak, he might fashion a companion to his taste. He
                    tried hard to cultivate my mind. He was always writing to me. That was another
                    odd thing about Gilbert Mandell. An ordinary young man looks upon pens and paper
                    with deep-rooted suspicion and distrust. I have had more than one flirtation
                    carried on solely by telegram. But Mr. Mandell was always writing me long
                    epistles, very carefully worded, and in a semi-literary style.<pb n="19" xml:id="VAB7114-014"/>
                    <pb n="21" xml:id="VAB7114-015"/> I remember I was very proud of those letters.
                    They flattered me in a young girl's most vulnerable point; they implied that my
                    opinion was worth having. I don't know whether it was that, or his pronounced
                    pessimism, which attracted me most. He was also fond of implyingâas he pointed
                    out, with a white hand, some masterpiece of the Florentine school, or sat
                    murmuring paradoxes over the tea-tableâthat there were places and things which
                    we should see, in the future, together.</p>
                <p>âThere is a little town in ItalyâOrvieto,â he said, one afternoon, when Christina
                    and I had been listening to a disquisition on the Renaissance, âwhere I must
                    take you one day, Marguerite. You must see the faÃ§ade of the cathedral. Orvieto
                    is an education in art.â</p>
                <p>It long remained vague. But one dayâit was a very wet day, I remember, and we
                    were coming back in a hansom from the National Galleryâhe alluded in a
                    roundabout sort of way to an organ he was pleased to call his heart. Then it
                    struck me all at once that it was impossible. It was not the Deodoriser that I
                    minded. I think it was the pinkness of his nails and a certain complaisant way
                    which<pb n="22" xml:id="VAB7114-016"/> he had of regarding me which
                    irritated me when it came to a question of a life-long interview.</p>
                <p>I suppose I must have said âNo,â and possibly with some fervour. Smiling vaguely,
                    he took my hand. He evidently did not believe me.</p>
                <p>âI won't hurry you, dear child,â he said, as he left me on my own doorstep. âYou
                    will think it overâyou will be able to make up your mind by-and-by.â</p>
                <p>But I never made up my mind that I wanted to marry Mr. Mandell.</p>
                <p>Not long after he came to say that he was going abroad. At first he wrote pretty
                    often, and, as usual, his letters were semi-literary, though to be sure the
                    âburning questionâ was discussed from various points of view. But, to my relief,
                    the letters got more and more literary as time went on, and finally they stopped
                    altogether.</p>

                <head>CHAPTER II</head>
                <p><hi>PERHAPS</hi> it was by way of contrast to the Superior Person that I
                    appreciated Tony Lambert so muchâfor a time. He was the most naÃ¯ve individual I
                    have ever known; indeed, his naÃ¯vetÃ© quite disarmed me. And, in a breezy, boyish
                    way he was diverting. To be sure, he did not expect me to read Schopenhauer, of
                    whose existence I imagine he was but dimly aware, nor did he ask me to spend
                    afternoons at the National Gallery. Kempton Park and the Gaiety Theatre were
                    more to his taste, and while this sportive affair lasted the house had a
                    rollicking, youthful atmosphere which was the result of something more subtle
                    than Tony's ringing laugh, and Tony's skirmishing fox terriers, who invariably
                    accompanied their master in his many visits.</p>
                <p>We neither of us took each other seriously, and that added a certain charm to the
                    thing.<pb n="24" xml:id="VAB7114-018"/> Everybody at home liked Tony,
                    except, I think, Christina, who said she couldn't understand his slang, and that
                    he made a draught in the drawing-room, he was so boisterous and restless. The
                    family saw a good deal of him in those days, for he was being painted in parade
                    dress, and he used to stay to lunch so as to be able to pose again in the
                    afternoon.</p>
                <p>I remember the first time he came in with father, pink with mortification at
                    being seen in his uniform in the daytime out of barracks. Whence comes, I
                    wonder, the love of mufti so deeply implanted in the breast of the British
                    officer? Tony, fortunately, learnt to forget his early sense of discomfiture,
                    and spent many merry half-hours in our little study when he had done sitting,
                    singing soldiers' songs with a fearful and wonderful accompaniment of his own
                    invention, while the dogs chased each other, barking joyously, over the sofas
                    and chairs. How he used to light up the dim little twilight room with his
                    scarlet bravery and his irrepressible spirits!</p>
                <p>Mr. Anthony Lamnbert was the eldest son of Norfolk People. One day or other he
                    would come into possession of a fine old house, some<pb n="25" xml:id="VAB7114-019"/>
                    <pb n="27" xml:id="VAB7114-020"/> excellent shooting, and three thousand a
                    yearâan income by no means large enough to keep up the Towers. Therefore it was
                    an understood thing, especially by Lady Marion, his mamma, that Tony, when he
                    married, was to marry money. In the meantime Tony was to be painted, first to
                    adorn the next exhibition at Burlington House, and afterwards the collection of
                    family portraits at the Towers. So that in this way the boy, in spite of Lady
                    Marion's precautions, came directly under the influence of a most undesirable
                    young person, to wit, myself.</p>
                <p>Tony was a lieutenant in a line regiment, and I fear his high spirits made him
                    have occasional differences of opinion with his colonel. In appearance he was
                    distinctly good to look at. He had a clean, pink skin, twinkling blue eyes, and
                    hair so flaxen that it was almost silver. His shoulders were broad and square,
                    he had a delightful laugh, and he was just three-and-twenty. And, without being
                    in the least conceited, Tony was thoroughly pleased with himself, his regiment,
                    and his belongings. He had, in a supreme degree, the magnetism which comes of
                    perfect health, good spirits, and complete self-satisfaction.</p>
                <pb n="28" xml:id="VAB7114-021"/>
                <p>What an infectious thing is happiness, and what a golden age is three-and-twenty!
                    With what vigour did Tony play lawn-tennis, how excited he got over races and
                    cricket matches, how hot he became when he danced, what portentous suppers he
                    could eat! ... The very sound of his voice in the hallâa voice with raised
                    inflections, for the ends of Tony's sentences always finished joyouslyâroused
                    one up on the foggiest and dreariest of days.</p>
                <p>To go for a walk in the park or along Piccadilly with Tony Lambert was a whole
                    education in itself in the ways of young men: his joy was so manifest when a
                    pretty face, a showy figure, or even a well-cut gown appeared in sight. He had
                    the omnivorous glance which takes in every detail, and which is the prerogative
                    of men who spend most of their leisure in sport. Seldom will you find a writer,
                    a lawyer, or a scientist with the faculty of observation as highly cultivated as
                    in the most brainless individual used to the rod and the gun.</p>
                <p>Tony, by-the-bye, was one of the young men with whom I corresponded by electric
                    telegraph. As a matter of fact, I do not<pb n="29" xml:id="VAB7114-022"/>
                    possess a scrap of his handwriting. Whether he was doubtful of his prowess in
                    grammar and spelling, or whether it was a bit of worldly wisdom beyond his
                    years, will remain for ever a mystery, but Christina got quite tired of those
                    agitated pulls of the bell which announced the telegraph boy, while at this
                    period orange-coloured envelopes were served up to me at every hour of the
                    day.</p>
                <p>There was nothing he didn't offer us, from invitations to military balls, to bags
                    of American candy. To me especially he offered a great many photographs of
                    himself, in various degrees of military splendour, which gave my room, for the
                    time being, quite a spirited and martial air. Of course this didn't last long,
                    for my photograph frames and space to put them are limited, whereas my friends
                    are many, and in the course of years one frame contains many âcounterfeit
                    presentments.â Christina says that, if I have a heart, it must be like my
                    photograph frames....</p>
                <p>From what I could gather, Mr. Lambert was never in love with fewer than three
                    ladies at a time. He was like one of the modern monster shopkeepers, a sort of
                    universal<pb n="30" xml:id="VAB7114-023"/> admirer of the fairer sex. And
                    yet one never blamed him for it, perhaps because he was so perfectly candid in
                    his enthusiasms. As far as I could make out, the fair with whom I shared his
                    affections at this time were his Major's wifeâa person with fluffy hair, an
                    exaggerated figure, and a well-worn smileâand an individual whose acquaintance,
                    it appeared, he had not yet succeeded in making, but who occupied a
                    distinguished position in the second row of the Gaiety chorus. It was always
                    amusing to get Tony on to the subject of his loves. The âlittle friendsâ that he
                    âplayed withâ seemed to have been of all ages and sizes, and his amorous
                    difficulties appeared to have been numerous. Once already had his family offered
                    a substantial sum to a young lady in the Camberwell Road as a substitute for
                    Tony's hand; but that, as he acknowledged with a pink and rueful countenance,
                    had been in âhis gay and giddy youth.â Having now arrived at the discreet age of
                    three-and-twenty, he was resolved to mend his ways. And to begin well, he
                    proceeded, in his airy and irresponsible way, to imagine that he cared about
                    me.</p>
                <pb n="31" xml:id="VAB7114-024"/>
                <p>I wonder what Lady Marion would have said of the three months that followed?</p>
                <p>Tony took his âlong leaveâ on January 1st, and it was at this time, being a good
                    deal in London, that he sat for his portrait. For the next two months Christina
                    and I were never sure when he would not burst into our den with his joyous laugh
                    and a couple of excited dogs wagging delighted tails, with some project of
                    rushing us off somewhere or other in search of amusement. What would Lady Marion
                    have said to all this, I wonder; and of those many accidental meetings in Bond
                    Street, when we used to drop in at the minor exhibitions, and come out sublimely
                    unconscious of whether we had been looking at Van Beers or Gustave DorÃ©? Or of
                    the pompous dances in Queen's Gate to which mother allowed me to take the boy,
                    and where he met, I believe for the first time in his life, the youth and
                    loveliness of South Kensington? Tony had met âcountyâ girls and âgarrisonâ girls
                    and Gaiety girls, but I don't think he had ever before danced with a London
                    middle-class damsel. Lady Marion, I verily believe, would have preferred the
                    young person in the Camberwell Road.</p>
                <pb n="32" xml:id="VAB7114-025"/>
                <p>But our last dance was not to be in Queen's Gate. The regiment was ordered to the
                    Curragh, and Tony was in despair. Nothing would do but we must come to the
                    regiment's farewell ball at Mulchester, and it was there, in the long, low rooms
                    of the Officers' Mess, against a background of flags and military trophies, that
                    I saw Tony's blonde head for the last time.... The pretty scene comes back to me
                    nowâthe glare of scarlet coats among the flesh-tones of the women; the
                    delicate-tinted tulle dresses against a bank of pink azaleas and palms; the blue
                    uniforms of the Gunners and the green of the Rifles striking a sombre note in
                    the gay chord of colour; the intimate sadness of those valse refrains which the
                    band of the regiment played; and over all that acute atmosphere of mixed pain
                    and pleasure which is associatedâwhen one is eighteenâwith the words âfor the
                    last time.â</p>
                <p>It was my first soldiers' ball. How well I remember the whole atmosphere of that
                    night: the Colonel, smiling, urbane, and slightly indifferent; the Colonel's
                    wife, a lady with protruding teeth and neatly-parted hair, who was said to be
                    wealthy; the eager young faces of<pb n="33" xml:id="VAB7114-026"/> the junior
                    subalterns as they surrounded some showy beauty; the heavy-jawed Captain to whom
                    I was introduced on my entry, and who deserted me at once for a buxom lady with
                    dubious hair and many diamonds.... Oh, those military ladies! How dashing, how
                    much too dashing, they were; what drawn-in waists, what liberal smiles, what
                    suspiciously white shoulders! How pert and off-hand they seemed in public, and
                    how confiding they looked in obscure corners down back passages, where Tony's
                    straw-coloured hair and scarlet coat were to be seen often during that night.
                    Heaven has not been pleased to inflict on me a suspicious disposition, or I fear
                    I should have passed but an indifferently amusing evening. For Mr. Anthony
                    Lambert, with the gay insouciance of youth, had thoughtlessly invited some
                    half-dozen of his âloves,â and his Major's wife, it appeared, was inordinately
                    jealous.</p>
                <p>Some fifteen years ago this lady had been described in a local newspaper as a
                    âmagnificent blonde,â and she had been living up to the epithet ever since. She
                    had all the airs of a beauty, and she seemed to regard Mr. Lambert as her
                    especial property. At ten o'clock I<pb n="34" xml:id="VAB7114-027"/> heard her
                    reproaching him for only wanting three dances; at one o'clock she deliberately
                    fetched him out of a balcony where he was saying good-bye to a pretty little
                    girl with red hair.... I don't wonder that Tony looked harassed; the smile of
                    his Major's wife was terrifying. Poor boy! I, at least, had never worried or
                    reproached him, and I think he was proportionately grateful at the last. It was
                    a black night and pouring rain, I remember, when we finally drove away, but I
                    could see that Tony's blue eyes looked unspeakable things as we whispered a
                    final hurried good-bye at the carriage door.</p>
                <p>One morning, a few months later, we read in the paper that a marriage had been
                    arranged, and would take place immediately, between Mr. Anthony Lambert of the
                    Blankshire Regiment, eldest son of Mr. and Lady Marion Lambert of the Towers,
                    Sleepington, Norfolk, and Katherine, eldest daughter of Patrick O'Flaherty,
                    Esq., of Dublin. He had been taken seriously by a garrison beauty a dozen years
                    older than himself. Although they have already three children, I hear that Lady
                    Marion refuses to see her enterprising Irish daughter-<pb n="35" xml:id="VAB7114-028"/> in-law, and now the regiment is in India. Poor Tony!
                    He was born, it would appear, to be the sport of the less amiable members of our
                    sex. His Major's wife is, of course, with the regiment, and people say that Mrs.
                    Anthony Lambert is primitively jealous. A ridiculous song that he used to strum
                    always occurs to me when I think of him, for the refrain <q>

                <head>CHAPTER III</head>
                <p><hi>IT</hi> is with an uneasy conscience that I recall the brief episode of Mr.
                    Hanbury Price. There used to be a derisive ring in Christina's voice when she
                    alluded to Mr. Price as my ânew young man.â She knew well enough that he could
                    not, by the wildest stretch of imagination, be called young. Neither, to be
                    sure, was he in the sere and yellow leaf. No, he was worse than old; he was
                    middle-aged. Middle-aged in ideas rather than in person, for he affected a
                    jauntiness of attire, which he was able to carry off to a certain extent, being
                    rather big, with a high colour, and having hair still untouched with grey. He
                    also liked to be thought what in early Victorian novels would have been called
                    âan agreeable rattleâ; but then half of Mr. Price's conversation consisted of
                    projects and invitations which somehow never came off. It was wonderful what a
                    reputation for festive<pb n="37" xml:id="VAB7114-030"/> hospitality Mr. Price
                    hadâamong people who didn't know him well.</p>
                <p>One of his least agreeable idiosyncrasies was his curious distrust of everybody.
                    He was always in dread of being, as he would have expressed it, âdone.â So
                    suspicious, indeed, was he, that he even suspected himself. His <foreign xml:lang="fre">coups</foreign> on the Stock Exchange, the bouquet he had
                    offered over-night, the very wine he drank, suggested the after-thought that he
                    had made a fool of himselfâthat it was possible he might not yet get the desired
                    return for his money. His small red-lidded eyes, of a watery blue, continually
                    betrayed this recurring idea, while his loosely-hung jaw and mouth gave signs of
                    a loquacious temperament, which his frequent and abrupt laugh did not succeed in
                    making genial.</p>
                <p>Though he did not mention it in polite society, Mr. Hanbury Price hailed from
                    Tulse Hill. In that eminently respectable suburb he had first seen the light,
                    and in the same stucco mansion there still resided his mother and a bevy of
                    plain unmarried sisters, to whom he used to journey down to partake of early
                    dinner on Sundays. âNever mention Tulse Hill to<pb n="38" xml:id="VAB7114-031"/>
                    smart people,â he confided to me one day with one of his sudden and unmirthful
                    laughs; âif I do, they want to know if it's in Yorkshire.â</p>
                <p>He was curiously anxious to be voted popularâat least among the right sort of
                    peopleâand was fond of alluding, in an airy way, to the parties he had given or
                    intended to give; but as he had an inherent dislike to laying out half-a-crown
                    on anything which was not strictly necessary, Mr. Price must have undergone
                    untold torturesâif, indeed, these festivities ever really came offâin his
                    efforts to be classed among the bachelors who entertain. Of course, it was only
                    in time that I became aware of all these amiable little peculiarities, for at
                    first sight Mir. Price gave one the impression of being a good-natured,
                    talkative, and gregarious member of society, with an inclination for giving
                    little dinners and theatre parties.</p>
                <p>We met him first on a Saturday-to-Monday on the river, at the house of a vulgar
                    little woman whose portrait father was painting. Mrs. Bodley-Gallard was loud in
                    his praises; she had, it transpired, only known Mr. Hanbury Price a fortnight.
                    Our hostess was one of those over-officious people who say things that make<pb n="39" xml:id="VAB7114-032"/> one's blood run cold. âNow, my dear Miss
                    Wynman,â she whispered to me on Sunday night after dinner, âplease be nice to
                    the poor young man.â Mrs. Bodley-Gallard belonged to the class of person who
                    calls everybody a âyoung manâ who still is unmarried, even though he be on the
                    wrong side of fifty. âI assure you he is devotedâquite devoted. Now promise me
                    you'll think about it!â A speech which had the effect of making me extremely
                    rude to Mr. Price when he joined me after dinner, and it was only when he had
                    seen us into our cab at Paddington station next morning that I mentioned, after
                    he had made repeated enquiries on the subject, that we were generally at home at
                    five o'clock.</p>
                <p>He was not long in coming, and when he appeared he was profuse in his
                    invitations. Would we do a theatre? would we dine with him? He was thinking of
                    taking a house on the river for August; he hoped that mother would bring us down
                    to stay with him.</p>
                <p>The least we could do was to accept his offer for the play. We were to dine
                    somewhere first, and the party was arranged for the following Tuesday. But when
                    Tuesday<pb n="40" xml:id="VAB7114-033"/> arrived, there was a post-card from
                    Mr. Price to say that the proposed festivity was postponed, and, as I afterwards
                    found out, because he had been vainly soliciting free admissions for the Thalia
                    Theatre from a young man whom he knew, who played the footman in the first
                    piece. Then, when the night at last arrived, we found we were to partake of a
                    three-and-sixpenny <foreign xml:lang="fre">table d'hÃ´te</foreign> dinner, with a
                    maddening accompaniment of glees; and this from a man who talked continually of
                    the Amphitryon and the Bachelors' Club. That damped my spirits to begin with. Of
                    course, when one is under twenty, one does not care much for the niceties of
                    cooking and the brand of the champagne; but it is lowering to one's dignity, in
                    the eyes of one's family, to be asked to dine at <foreign xml:lang="fre">table
                        d'hÃ´te</foreign> with travelling Yankees and gaping provincials. But it was
                    nothing to what followed.</p>
                <p>We were a party of fiveâmother and I, and a couple of men beside our host. When
                    we were at last landed inside the doors of the Thalia, we found that Mr. Hanbury
                    Price had secured seats for his party in the fourth row of the dress circle. The
                    two other men <choice>
                        <orig>ex-</orig>
                        <reg>exchanged</reg>
                    </choice><pb n="41" xml:id="VAB7114-034"/>
                    <pb n="43" xml:id="VAB7114-035"/> changed amused and surprised glances; mother
                    and I declared we much preferred the dress circle to a box or stalls; and Mr.
                    Price, who began to dimly discern that for once his economy was ill-timed, spent
                    half his evening in the lobby, having, as I shrewdly suspect, a prolonged
                    altercation with the attendant on the subject of a charge of sixpence for each
                    programme.</p>
                <p>It grieves me to think what we must have cost Mr. Hanbury Price in hansoms, for
                    our house, as he more than once explained, is inconveniently situated for
                    omnibuses. Whether he really imagined himself to be in love I have never been
                    able to decide, but he was obviously haunted by dreadful forebodings as to the
                    expense of a young lady with my tastes and proclivities. He used to lecture me
                    about taking care of my gowns, and suggested that I was recklessly extravagant
                    in the matter of feather boas and shoes.... One day he tried to persuade me to
                    attend the cookery classes at South Kensington; and another evening, when he was
                    unusually sentimental, he asked me if I didn't like the neighbourhood of Notting
                    Hill? All this contributed to<pb n="44" xml:id="VAB7114-036"/> Christina's joy,
                    for Mr. Price's struggles between economy and the tender passion were really
                    diverting to behold.</p>
                <p>I think, perhaps, when I look back at the whole affair dispassionately, that it
                    was the box of chocolates that ended Mr. Hanbury Price's dream. One afternoon,
                    when he had been particularly confidential, he asked me, at parting, if I cared
                    for sweets. The next day there arrived from the Civil Service Stores a small
                    cardboard box of second-rate chocolate creams, addressed to meâto me, who had
                    had qualms of conscience that he might have telegraphed to Paris for some
                    elaborate offering from the Boulevard des Italiens. Telegraphed, indeed! Hanbury
                    Price was not the man to waste his money in telegrams, when a letter, or, better
                    still, a halfpenny postcard, would answer the same purpose. I have quite a
                    collection of postcards in his handwriting, for he wrote often on every sort of
                    matter, and he chiefly used the cheapest means of communication. There is the
                    mass of postcards, for instance, which relates to the famous dinner at the
                    Crystal Palace, which finally ended the affair.</p>
                <pb n="45" xml:id="VAB7114-037"/>
                <p>We tried hard to get out of it, Christina and I, but it was of no avail, and in
                    the end we had to go. Mrs. Bodley-Gallard was to be the chaperon, and there were
                    to be one or two other men. I like to go over the events of that day, for they
                    are unique in my history.</p>
                <p>Five o'clock was the hour of meeting at Victoria Station. It was high midsummer,
                    and bitterly cold and damp. Arrived at the station, we found that Mr. Price had
                    already taken second-class tickets for the whole party, but that he was not
                    above recouping himself from our purses for this outlay. âJust as jolly
                    second-class,â declared our host, âif you're a party, don't you know;â though he
                    laughed awkwardly when he found that a couple of damp, plush-clad babies, with
                    their respective mammas, were also to journey down with us to Sydenham. Of
                    course we arrived too early, and wandered about on the interminable and dubious
                    boards of the Palace among pieces of greasy paperâthe remnants of recent
                    feastsâuntil seven o'clock.</p>
                <p>But dinner came at lastâwith a lengthy harangue as to which table Mr. Price had
                    selected, an interview with the manager, and<pb n="46" xml:id="VAB7114-038"/>
                    some sour Sauterne-cup. Only one young man had turned up (the other two had
                    probably dined with Mr. Price before), and he chaffed our host into ordering a
                    beverage more suitable to the damp night; but even that failed to revive the
                    flagging spirits of the party. Mournful pauses fell, and Hanbury Price's eye
                    travelled anxiously after the champagne bottle as it went its way round the
                    table. Even Mrs. Bodley-Gallard could not pretend that she was enjoying herself.
                    And then, with the phenomenally hard peaches and dried figs, came the final
                    blow. There were to be fireworks, but our host had evidently no intention of
                    offering us covered seats from which to view them. âOne of you young ladies will
                    come with me in the grounds,â urged the ever-economical Hanbury, casting a
                    sentimental and meaning glance in my direction. âI'm afraid I've caught cold
                    already,â I said with decision. And then Christina, with true nobility, came to
                    my rescue, in answer to my appealing nudge: âI will, if you like,â she said,
                    quickly; âPeggy can't wander about in the dark and the cold tonight. She's
                    nearly got bronchitis as it is; the child must stay indoors.â</p>
                <pb n="47" xml:id="VAB7114-039"/>
                <p>The only young man at once secured seats for the chaperon and myself, and Mr.
                    Hanbury Price spent what he may have intended to be the eventful night of his
                    life wandering about the grounds, under a dripping umbrella, with my sister.
                    Christina's account of the evening is extremely diverting. I shall always be
                    grateful to her for that night. Whatever differences may arise between us in
                    after years, I shall never forget from what an awkward interview Christina saved
                    me.</p>
                <p>And he, for his part, had a chastened air in the railway-carriage coming
                    home.</p>
                <p>We left town very soon after, and when I meet Mr. Hanbury Price on rare occasions
                    in the Park, or at some crowded party, I get ready my sweetest and most
                    deceitful smile. But Mr. Hanbury Price invariably looks the other way.</p>

                <p><hi>THE</hi> gleam of velvety grass through a grey cloister, a bare oaken
                    staircase, leading to a low room lined with books; a cushioned window seat, a
                    summer night, and the distant sound of someone playing the violin: <choice>
                        <sic>hese</sic>
                        <corr>these</corr>
                    </choice> are the things that come back to me whenever anyone pronounces the
                    name of Frank Harding.</p>
                <p>It was at Oxford, at Commemoration, that I saw him first. He was lying on his
                    back on the grass in one of those small, meagre gardens in the Parks which make
                    the joy of Oxford dons and their wives, and their troops of babies. As a matter
                    of fact, he was being photographedâwe were all being photographedâas is the
                    pleasing custom during Commemoration week. We had gone to pay a call on the
                    Talford BrownsâTalford Brown is the most eminent authority on the PhÅnician
                    language in Oxfordâand we had been at once taken<pb n="49" xml:id="VAB7114-041"/> into the garden, where tea and the photographer's camera awaited us. There we
                    found the usual Oxford group: the lady with smooth hair and clinging gown, one
                    or two vague, bearded Fellows or tutors, the girl in a pince-nez and badly-made
                    boots, a couple of small boys, two babies, three dogs, andâFrank. Flat on his
                    back, as I said before; his six foot one of length arrayed in virgin flannels
                    and a Trinity College blazer.</p>
                <p>Frank Harding was one of those exceptional beings, an undergraduate on easyânay,
                    even familiarâterms with dons. The wives of these gentlemen were very tolerant
                    of Frankâindeed, if it were given to a don's wife to be capable of a flirtation,
                    I am pretty sure they would have flirted with him. As it was, he strolled in and
                    out of those villas in Norham Gardens very much as he liked, played with the
                    babies, teased the dogs, and helped the ladies of the house in their perennial
                    little difficulties with the Greek syntax. In spite of his eccentricities and
                    those daring caricatures of the dons of his which regularly appeared in
                    Shrimpton's window, the authorities all liked Frank, and everybody was ready to
                    betâif<pb n="50" xml:id="VAB7114-042"/> one can picture such a transaction
                    taking place in a college common-roomâthat Frank would take a First.</p>
                <p>We stayed to dinner at the Talford Browns, and we were much struck with the
                    somewhat affected simplicity of the Oxford interior. There was a long table,
                    sparsely decorated with attenuated glass flower-holders, in each of which were
                    placed three Iceland poppies. Mrs. Talford Brown, who had the reputation of
                    being a wit, and was understood to say scathing things about the undergraduates,
                    herself carved the cold mutton which formed the principal dish at dinner.
                    Professor Talford Brown drank toast-and-water. We had a salad, with a trifle too
                    much vinegar, and we talked a good deal of the higher education of women, and of
                    the recent finals for honours which had just come off. Christina sat next to the
                    Professor, and I could see that our host and hostess were as much taken with her
                    as it is possible for Oxford people to be with a mere Londoner; and this was an
                    inexpressible relief to me, for every minute I felt that I was falling lower in
                    their regard. An irresistible impulse seized me to say<pb n="51" xml:id="VAB7114-043"/> frivolous things, to giggle in an imbecile manner,
                    and to ask Mrs. Talford Brown if she had ever been to the Empire? Do what I may
                    in the after years, I know that I shall ever be regarded with contempt in those
                    Oxford circles in which âplain living and high thinkingâ obtain. But Frank
                    Harding, who sat next to me, by no means shared this opinion. To begin with, we
                    recollected that we were, so to speak, old friends. We remembered that it had
                    taken two nurses and a governess to make peace between us some fifteen years
                    ago, when we had met at a children's party and found no favour in each other's
                    eyes. The Hardings, indeed, were connections of my mother's, so that we had seen
                    Frank now and then up to the trying age of eight; but after that they had gone
                    to live in the country, and we had lost sight of them for years. But on the
                    strength of my having pulled his hair some dozen years ago, Frank, in his
                    unconventional and airy way, insisted on calling us âChristinaâ and âPeggy.â</p>
                <p>After dinner, Mrs. Talford Brown went up to put the twins to bedânothing was ever
                    allowed to interfere with this domestic riteâ<pb n="52" xml:id="VAB7114-044"/>
                    and then we all sat in the ugly little square garden, and watched a great yellow
                    moon travel slowly up the sky. And Frank Harding talked. He was as far removed
                    from the ordinary football-playing young man as it is possible to be. To begin
                    with, his father was a poetâone of our finest latter-day lyristsâand it was from
                    him that he inherited all his sympathy, his feminine intuitions, and his
                    charmingly impracticable theories. At present, of course, he was only a clever,
                    somewhat lanky boy; but his beautiful grey eyes made him almost handsome, and
                    his perfectly easy manners were curiously attractive. He had the wildest ideas,
                    and was the sort of man who might found a new religion, commit a murder, devote
                    a lifetime to the East End, or take away his neighbour's wife and write a book
                    to prove that his action was justified. Some years have passed since then, but I
                    shall never be astonished to hear anything of Frank Harding, except that he had
                    gone into the City and was paying taxes in Bayswater.</p>
                <p>We saw a great deal of Frank in the days that followed. To enjoy Commemoration,
                    one must be twenty and never have stayed in<pb n="53" xml:id="VAB7114-045"/>
                    Oxford before. It was astonishing how much we managed to get into that week, and
                    how much of Frank's society we had.... There were lazy mornings, punting on the
                    Cherwell, and picnics to Godstow and Sanford Lasher, the ball at Christ Church,
                    and the garden-parties in the colleges, for which we put on our best frocks, and
                    stared at the celebrities, and then hurried home to a cosy tea in our rooms,
                    where a dozen undergraduates fought decorously for the honour of handing the
                    tea-cups. And then the endless strawberries, the valses that were quarrelled
                    for, the unstinted devotion of the boys....</p>
                <p>I am old-fashioned enough to like a young man to be in love. Even if his passion
                    burns for someone else, one likes to see it, and it is still more interesting
                    when the young man expends his ardour on oneself. So Frank fell in love with me,
                    and I liked it.... I remember it all as if it were yesterday.</p>
                <p>There is the sad-coloured June dayâa harmony in soft greys and greensâwhen we
                    went to pick fritillaries in Mesopotamia. It was the day after Commemoration was
                    over, and the narrow, willow-fringed river was <choice>
                        <orig>de-</orig>
                        <reg>deserted</reg>
                    </choice><pb n="54" xml:id="VAB7114-046"/> serted. Afar off we could see the
                    grey spires and towers of the University against the wide, white sky, while
                    across the fat, buttercup-gilded meadows came the mellow, distant sound of
                    Oxford bells. As Frank pushed the punt lazily up stream, we seemed wrapped in a
                    mysterious green silence. We left the punt where the old chain ferry crosses the
                    Cherwell, and plunged into the long new grass. I carried a basket for the
                    fritillaries, and Frank had brought an empty soda-water bottle; a proceeding
                    which puzzled me immensely, until I found that all among the abundant grass
                    studded with June flowers there leapt and danced hundreds of tiny, nimble,
                    gay-hearted frogs, only lately emerged from the juvenile or tadpole state. âThey
                    are <emph>so</emph> like undergraduates!â I cried, kneeling in the long grass
                    and stretching depredatory fingers here and there, while Frank pretended to be
                    offended, and declared I shouldn't put any of my frogs into his soda-water
                    bottle.... But in the end we compromised, and Frank was set to gather the queer,
                    spotted, purplish-brown fritillaries, whilst I crammed the leaping little
                    reptiles into our bottle.... And so the June afternoon slipped<pb n="55" xml:id="VAB7114-047"/> by, until the clang of evening bells warned us it was
                    time to turn homewards....</p>
                <p>The next morning, when the train which conveyed us back to town steamed out of
                    the station, the two things I carried away with me as a remembrance of my first
                    Commemoration were a lapful of La France roses and the sight of a pair of
                    wistful grey eyes.</p>
                <p>Frank had got permission to stay in Oxford during a part of the vacation and
                    work, but his work took a form which would scarcely have met with the entire
                    approval of his tutor, seeing that he was reading for a First in classics. One
                    night, a few days after, as Christina and I were dressing for an evening party,
                    I was handed a letter in a strange handwriting. It contained a poem, and the
                    poem was about myself! After Tony's telegrams and Hanbury Price's post-cards it
                    seemed idyllic to have a charming, clever young man writing poems aboutâme! I
                    waved the missive triumphantly under Christina's nose, and made myself, as she
                    remarked, odious for the rest of the evening.</p>
                <p>âHe says I am like the morning star shining above the mists of a murky city, and
                    that the<pb n="56" xml:id="VAB7114-048"/> birds sing sweeter at my foot-fall,
                    and skim like Hope across life'sââ</p>
                <p>âLife's fiddlestick!â said Christina. âPass those hot tongs. How you can
                    encourage boys to write you such rubbish I can't conceive. And we're an hour
                    late as it is. Get on your cloak, Peggy, and for Heaven's sake throw that drivel
                    into the fire.â</p>
                <p>But I naturally did nothing of the kind, and when Frank appeared at our house a
                    week later, somewhat sad of mien and looking rather thin, I did my best to cheer
                    him up, though we neither of us said a word about the poem. He stayed until it
                    was time to catch the last train to Oxford, and after that he was always
                    appearing at unexpected moments. He used to write me odd little abrupt notes,
                    asking if I cared to see him? What could I say? It is awkward to tell people
                    that you don't wish to see them. Besidesâbesides, I did want to....</p>
                <p>It was only when it came to the stern realities of life that I took Christina's
                    point of view, and saw what an impossible thing it was.... I remember so well
                    the day it was finally decidedâa cold, drizzling November afternoon. He had
                    rushed up from the<pb n="57" xml:id="VAB7114-049"/> country, where he was living
                    now that he had left Oxford, and had been shown into the long amber-and-white
                    drawing-room, where they had forgotten to light a fire, so that the cold winter
                    twilight wrapped us round as we sat. Frank had taken a First, and there was some
                    idea of his getting a Fellowship. But he did not wish to stop in Oxford, or,
                    indeed, in England. The imperial destinies of the English race was one of his
                    hobbies, and he asked me to give up London and go to North-Western Canada, where
                    he wanted to start a new community. Visions of Margaret Fuller and the
                    âBlithedale Romance,â of Laurence Oliphant and his self-sacrificing bride, were
                    evoked to tempt me. But I knewâI still had sense enough to know-that it was not
                    for me....</p>
                <p>The dreary November day had closed in before Frank rose to go. And long after he
                    had gone I sat on in the cold dark room. One by one the lamps twinkled out all
                    up the street, and a dreary piano-organ came and played some threadbare airs
                    from a comic opera.... Christina was very nice to me when she found me sitting
                    alone in the cold and the dark, for I think she knew I had been crying....</p>
                <pb n="58" xml:id="VAB7114-050"/>
                <p>Frank Harding has always refused to see me since that day. He writes sometimes;
                    the last time I heard from him he was in South Africa, and I gathered from his
                    letter that he considered the amalgamation, by marriage, of the Boer race the
                    duty of all English settlers in the Transvaal....</p>
                <p>There are timesâtimes when I am a little tired of the egotism and puerile
                    frivolity of London young men, tired of their little quarrels and their little
                    admirations for fashionable divinitiesâwhen I would give worlds to see Frank
                    stretched in my deck-chair, his grey eyes gazing into futurity, and propounding
                    even the most amazing of his curious social schemes.</p>
                <p>And heâdoes he ever think of those old Oxford days, days full of cool green
                    shadows and quick with emotion, over yonder in his home under a torrid sky?
                    Probably notâprobably not. âThere are no fields of amaranth on this side of the
                    graveâ some poet has wisely written; âThere is no name, with whatever emphasis
                    of passionate love repeated, of which the echo is not faint at last.â</p>

                <p><hi>HE</hi> was curiously pretty, incredibly malicious, and indisputably âsmart,â
                    with a nice house in Sloane Street, where he entertained a great deal, and a
                    little following of young gentlemen who copied his neckties and buttonholes, and
                    whom one sometimes saw giggling together in corners, and calling each other by
                    pet names. When one of them wanted to give Val Redmond a birthday presentâin
                    that set the young<pb n="60" xml:id="VAB7114-052"/> men constantly make each
                    other little presentsâhe chose a silver vinaigrette, which Val took out with him
                    to dinner all that season. And yet the boy was very far from being a fool. If he
                    had lived in less degenerate days, and had been obliged to work for his living,
                    he might have made a name for himself. But as it was, he only gave amusing
                    parties; while one was haunted by misgivings if one had to leave his
                    drawing-room earlyâwith one's reputation behind.</p>
                <p>When he gave dinners and Sunday lunches at his house in Sloane Street, his aunt,
                    Lady Marchmont, presided. To have had only men's parties would not have suited
                    Val. He liked the society of women, and particularly of old women; but then his
                    elderly female friends were invariably clever, and some had had, in addition, an
                    almost historical past. â<emph>Dear</emph> Julia Calverly,â he would say of the
                    Dowager Countessâhe had the most astounding way of talking of his elderly
                    damesââI <emph>love</emph> that woman. It is as good as reading a scandalous
                    âMÃ©moire pour servirâ to talk to her.â</p>
                <p>âJulia is very <foreign xml:lang="fre">fin de siÃ¨cle</foreign>,â admitted a
                    pasty-looking youth of nineteen.</p>
                <pb n="61" xml:id="VAB7114-053"/>
                <p>âOh, my dear! ... End of the last century, you mean,â smirked Val.</p>
                <p>One of the most amusing things about Mr. Valentine Redmond was his imperturbable
                    coolness. Though hardly two-and-twenty, he had none of the tremors, the
                    diffidences of youth. I have seen him talk to an archbishop or a foreign
                    potentate with the same ease with which he would tackle an undergraduate or take
                    a young lady down to supper. Not that you would ever have caught Val Redmond
                    wasting his acidulous sweetness on a young girl. Women under thirty seldom went
                    to his house.</p>
                <p>One of his least pleasing characteristics was a tendency to flout and pout. He
                    was constantly having little quarrels with his intimate friends. His intimate
                    friendships lasted, on an average, exactly six weeks. In other houses where they
                    talk scandal it is usually about acquaintances, but in Val's drawing-room you
                    generally heard his bosom friends deprived of their reputations. This is a trait
                    which makes society feel uneasy, and to it one may perhaps attribute the brief
                    duration of Val's friendships. Ours, for instance, though it was never
                    perfervid, lasted but a brief two months.</p>
                <pb n="62" xml:id="VAB7114-054"/>
                <p>The Duchess of Birmingham brought him to our house. She was going to have her
                    portrait painted, and Val was brought along to help to decide on her costume. He
                    knew a great deal about clothes; his taste was charming, his house as pretty as
                    a house need be. Her Grace was a stout little person from Philadelphia, who was
                    at vast pains to acquire an English manner. Her chief desire, as far as I could
                    make out, was to be painted in a coronet. But Mr. Redmond, with his head on one
                    side and his eyes half shut, tabooed the idea of a diadem. He was rather in
                    favour of sables, of dark velvets, of heavy brocades. Father, I remember, was
                    furious when he had gone. âDoes the young puppy think he knows more about it
                    than I do? Confound his impudenceâwhy, I have been painting portraits for twenty
                    years.â</p>
                <p>And yet, after all, it was Valentine's costume which was chosen, and the Duchess
                    brought him again more than once to see the picture as it progressed. Father
                    always liked to have me in the studio when he was painting, so that every time
                    he appeared we made a little more of each other's acquaintance. I think I<pb n="63" xml:id="VAB7114-055"/> was rather rude to him than otherwise, but he
                    was the sort of person who disliked gushâin women. Gushing was too much the
                    prerogative of his âboys,â who usually, by-the-bye, were heard addressing each
                    other as âmy dear.â</p>
                <p>Sitting on the oaken staircase of the studio, talking to Val while the Duchess's
                    portrait went on below, I learnt a number of surprising things about London
                    society. He told me of all the houses where a young man might permit himself to
                    be seen, where it would be to his advantage to do so, and where it would be
                    fatal, absolutely fatal, for him to appear. âI had the imprudence to lunch with
                    the Patterson-Tayleurs, those new people in Prince's Gate; and though, of
                    course, a lunch doesn't count the same as a dinner, I assure you it was weeks
                    before I heard the last of it. A young man can't be too careful where he goes,â
                    Val confided to me one day with a rueful air. He had found me filling the bowls
                    and vases with roses, and had insisted on being allowed to help. It was one of
                    his talents, that of arranging flowers. He was sitting on the hall table,
                    swinging his feet, and holding his head on one side as he twitched an
                    amethyst-coloured orchid in front of the<pb n="64" xml:id="VAB7114-056"/> light.
                    âThere is the question of dancing, too. Ah, not <emph>that</emph>,â screamed Mr.
                    Redmond in his rather shrill voice, as he plucked a huge poppy out of my hand;
                    âyou can't <emph>possibly</emph> put that in blue and white; Nankin is only for
                    roses! What was I saying? Oh yes, about balls. Isn't it absurd of people to
                    expect one to dance everywhere? ... Some of us were at Mrs. Vandeleur's ball the
                    other nightâyou know the woman I mean, with a quantity of drab daughters?âand
                    she actually had the effrontery to seize me by the elbow and ask me why I wasn't
                    dancing the polka? As if anyone ever did anything but sup at the Vandeleurs! and
                    as if she didn't know perfectly well that one only dances at the houses where
                    one dines! I resisted for a long time, and then she had the shocking taste to
                    remind me that she had seen me leading the cotillon at the Duchess's with Lady
                    Susan, when she knows that Lady Susan is one of the most amusing persons in
                    London. She is the <foreign xml:lang="fre">fin-de-siÃ¨cle</foreign> old
                    maid.â</p>
                <p>I shall never forget our first dinner at his house in Sloane Street. It was the
                    oddest party. There was something strange and unusual not only about the guests,
                    but the very<pb n="65" xml:id="VAB7114-057"/> dishes and the flowers. The
                    dining-room, painted and decorated like that of a Roman villa, contained nothing
                    but the table and one or two giant palms in pots of old faÃ¯ence. The tablecloth
                    was nearly covered with a mass of pink rose-leaves, with here and there a spray
                    of roses thrown carelessly on to this pink carpet. A huge lamp of Oriental
                    workmanship, hung by gold chains, lighted up the mass; of rose colour, and there
                    were none of the usual fripperies of a lady's table. But perhaps what struck one
                    most on glancing round the room was the fact that all the men were boys, though
                    they appeared prematurely old, and that all the ladies were elderly, though
                    they, to be sure, looked unnaturally young.</p>
                <p>âThe glories of the past,â simpered the pale, clean-shaven youth who had taken me
                    in, surveying the ladies with unabashed effrontery. âIt reminds one of the ruins
                    of the Acropolis, don't you know.â</p>
                <p>My neighbour got very confidential as the dinner progressed. He gazed at me
                    critically with tired eyes, under lids which drooped a little at the
                    corners.</p>
                <p>âDo you know our host well? No? A<pb n="66" xml:id="VAB7114-058"/> pity he's so
                    shockingly malicious. Gives charming dinnersâas far as the people goâbut I don't
                    think much of his cook, do you? Oh no, I've only known him a fortnight; he
                    insisted on being introduced to me at the Vandeleurs' ball, and I thought, as he
                    is a great friend of one of my dearest friendsâTommy Singleton, you knowâthat he
                    would be sure to be nice.... And I really do think he's charming. He would take
                    no denial; I've dined here already three times.... We go everywhere together. Do
                    you see that weird old person opposite? She says such quite too deliciously
                    amusing things; she is a great friend of the Prince of Wales's. Tommy Singleton
                    seems in great form to-night. He is so very charming! I must introduce you to
                    him, though I'm afraid, my dear Miss Wynman, that you won't get on very well.
                    Tommy is so dreadfully frightened of <foreign xml:lang="fre">dÃ©butantes</foreign>. Don't you think dear Lady Rougemont's new <foreign xml:lang="fre">toupÃ©e</foreign> is quite delicious? I do. But then I
                    <emph>adore</emph> the meretricious and the artificial. That is Miss Van
                    Hoyt, the American heiress; she always wears that miniature of an old gentleman
                    with a hook nose and powdered hair. She says it's her grandfather;<pb n="67" xml:id="VAB7114-059"/> but Tommy Singleton declaresâand he had it from the
                    Duchessâthat Miss Van Hoyt's grandfather kept a small cheesemonger's shop in
                    Ninth Avenue. How quite too weird Lady Susan looks; but then she always has her
                    gowns made from remnants bought at the summer sales. She must have said
                    something dreadfully improper to Val, he is laughing so; look, he has got quite
                    pink! I wonder what it is? I shall ask her directly; she loves to have the whole
                    table listen to her storiesâthough really her stories are <foreign xml:lang="fre">d'un raide</foreign>! Lady Susan, you know, is not afraid of
                    <foreign xml:lang="fre">le mot qui choque</foreign>.â</p>
                <p>And, of a truth, the ladies at Mr. Redmond's dinner-table denied themselves
                    nothing in the way of speech. Nor, when the cigarettes were handed round, did
                    they show the usual feminine reluctance to light up; though this may have been a
                    protest on their part against the effeminacy of the age, for it was a remarkable
                    fact at Mr. Valentine Redmond's parties that, though the elderly ladies
                    invariably smoked, none of the young gentlemen indulged in nicotine.</p>
                <p>When the men rejoined us in the drawing-room, I found myself, to my surprise,
                    the<pb n="68" xml:id="VAB7114-060"/> centre of a small group of attentive
                    youths. One sat on a footstool at my feet, another hung over the back of the
                    sofa, while a third reclined among the cushions at my elbow. And they all asked
                    if they might come and call. Afterwards I heard that Mr. Redmond had passed the
                    word that I was âcharming,â a dictum which they always accepted without
                    questioning. Val and his friends invariably worshipped in a little crowd.</p>
                <p>After that night Mr. Valentine Redmond was pleased to indulge in one of his wild
                    enthusiasms. He brought all his boys to see me, one by one, and insisted that
                    they should admire me as much as he did; which was as tiresome for them, poor
                    things, as for me. My photograph, framed in gold and turquoises, was, for
                    exactly five weeks, a conspicuous object on his drawing-room table; after which,
                    for a fortnight, it stood on a cupboard in a dark corner, and finally, I hear,
                    disappeared altogetherâto the limbo where the rest of his departed âenthusiasmsâ
                    languish. But I am anticipating the catastrophe. For six weeks, at least, Val
                    and I saw a good deal of each other. At one of our big parties Mr. Redmond and
                    some of<pb n="69" xml:id="VAB7114-061"/> his young friends made quite a little
                    sensation when they appeared. They were all clean-shaven, and all had tired
                    eyes, exaggerated buttonholes, and shoes of phenomenal luminosity.</p>
                <p>âGracious heavens!â whispered Christina, when she saw them all file inâthey
                    always went about in cabfulsââWhat are they? Where did you find them? And what's
                    to be done with them now they're here?â But Valentine Redmond and his friends
                    never wanted amusing. They all had a passion for being introduced to other young
                    men of their own age, and, failing that, they gathered together in corners and
                    smirked over their own little jokes.</p>
                <p>The chief amusement of these boys, I soon found out, was to go to music-halls.
                    They spoke of Miss Bessie Bellwood with bated breath; and would hear of no other
                    comedians than Mr. Arthur Roberts and Mr. Albert Chevalier. They had a positive
                    infatuation for acrobats, for those stout, bespangled gentlemen who tie
                    themselves into knots and balance themselves on each other's heads, with a fixed
                    smile, to the accompaniment of a spirited waltz<pb n="70" xml:id="VAB7114-062"/>
                    tune. It was Val Redmond's delight to get two or three smart women to dinner,
                    with a corresponding number of boys, and then to take the party on to the Empire
                    or to the Pavilion.</p>
                <p>âWhy do you like tumblers and topical songs so much?â I asked Val one day, when I
                    had refused, for the fourth time, a pleading invitation to make one of a party
                    to the Tivoli. He shrugged his shoulders and looked rather annoyed.</p>
                <p>âCulture is such a bore,â he said; â<foreign xml:lang="fre">on a besoin de
                    s'encanailler quelquefois</foreign>.â</p>
                <p>This London idyl lasted, I think, nearly two months, and then, as London idyls
                    will, it came to a painless death. Its end was hastened by gossips, and it was
                    killed with a <foreign xml:lang="fre">mot</foreign>.</p>
                <p>âVal Redmond's ambition was to start a <foreign xml:lang="fre">salon</foreign> in
                    Sloane Street, but he has only succeeded, so far, in running a restaurant,â
                    Christina had said on one of her unamiable days.</p>
                <p>Someone, of course, told Val.</p>
                <p>The rupture left no sense of loss. Though good-looking, clever, and amusing, Val
                    Redmond's personality somehow âleft one cold.â It was an essentially thin
                    nature. Had I ever had occasion to appeal to his help, his<pb n="71" xml:id="VAB7114-063"/> sympathy, I fancy I should have had a charming,
                    gushing little note to say that he was going out of town. One had an uneasy
                    feeling that his devotion was only meant for dinner-parties; his little
                    compliments were, like his bonbons, the accompaniments of the box he offered you
                    at the play.</p>
                <p>Once a year or so we still go and dine with Val. The swinging lamp, the spreading
                    palms, the wealth of hot-house flowers are always there, but it is the rarest
                    thing to find the same face. Our host renews his friends as often as the
                    bouquets in his buttonhole.</p>

                <p><hi>THE</hi> provincial young man has never possessed any attractions for me, and
                    it is certain that, if I had not gone up North to stay with Daisy Drysdale, I
                    should never have known so well such a striking specimen of the type as Dr.
                    Styles. He was not a bad fellow, but he was naÃ¯vely pleased with himself and his
                    belongings. Your provincial, indeed, is rarely modest; in the limited circle of
                    country-town society a suitable young man is pursued with too much pertinacity
                    and ardour to have any doubts in his own mind as to his personal desirability
                    and manifold charms.</p>
                <p>Dr. Styles was a stoutish person of thirty-two, with nondescript features and a
                    slow, portentous manner, along with a large and increasing practice in the
                    suburb of Northaw, where his medical skill was in constant request among the
                    spinsters and widows of that <choice>
                        <orig>some-</orig>

                    <pb n="75" xml:id="VAB7114-066"/> what damp and chilly neighbourhood. So highly
                    esteemed were his services in the sick-room that these ladies would send for him
                    at all hours of the day or night, until the good doctor, in self-defence, took
                    to sending his red-haired assistant to some of his more flagrantly imaginary
                    invalids.</p>
                <p>Daisy Drysdale's husband was a manufacturer in Mudchester, and, like other
                    manufacturers, he lived as far away from the factory chimneys of that thriving
                    city as possible. So his brand-new red-brick mansion lay on the other side of
                    the suburb of Northaw, and the society of Northaw supplied nearly all Mrs.
                    Drysdale's intellectual recreation. Poor Daisy! how she missed London! And what,
                    as she plaintively asked, was the use of her giving little dinners, seeing the
                    component elements of which her parties were to be henceforward composed? Still,
                    she was not to be baffled, and Mrs. Drysdale constantly entertained. She kept
                    open house, too, and was delighted to see people drop in of an evening. The very
                    night I arrived, by some chance, Dr. Styles came in about nine o'clock.</p>
                <p>They were playing whist at one end of<pb n="76" xml:id="VAB7114-067"/> the long
                    drawing-room, and I was set down to entertain the doctor at the other.</p>
                <p>I shall not easily forget that night. Accustomed to the manifestly insincere
                    gushings of London young men, I was amused at the naÃ¯ve manner in which this
                    country Ãsculapius comported himself. For a long time we talked of the last
                    exhibition at Burlington House, for he remembered father's pictures, and was
                    much impressed, apparently, by the fact that he was talking to an Academician's
                    daughter. The provinces are still impressed by the Royal Academy.</p>
                <p>They played more than one rubber of whist that night, but Dr. Styles remained
                    until the end. Before he left he had offered to lend me a horse, proposed that
                    he should drive me to a ruin ten miles off, and expressed a wish that I should
                    know his three sisters.</p>
                <p>The drive to the ruin had assumed the proportions of a picnic before three days
                    were over. Life, as someone has justly observed, would be tolerable if it were
                    not for its pleasures, and possibly our English summers would be less dreary to
                    look back upon were it not for the inevitable picnic.</p>
                <pb n="77" xml:id="VAB7114-068"/>
                <p>The day declared itself grey and chilly, with watery-looking clouds hanging
                    despondingly overhead; but as it was not actually raining, we of course felt
                    obliged to start. The doctor drove Mrs. Drysdale and me, and, as he had to stop
                    and see several patients on his way out of Northaw, we were three-quarters of an
                    hour late when we arrived on the festive scene. We found our friends reclining
                    on rugs and cushions in a damp field, where there was an unmistakable odour of
                    manure; we found, also, that they were already more than half through the meal;
                    for, as they justly observed, the cold had made them uncommonly hungry, though
                    the quantity of well-picked bones and empty bottles sufficiently proclaimed the
                    fact. But the mention of empty bottles suggests an air of hilarity which did not
                    belong to this particular feast. A number of total abstainers were of the party,
                    and these had brought their own supply of perry, lemonade, and mineral waters,
                    and now sat apart round one table-cloth, surveying, with somewhat un-sheeplike
                    glances, the goats who were imbibing shandy-gaff and claret. This attitude on
                    the part of non-<pb n="78" xml:id="VAB7114-069"/> alcoholic Northaw not being
                    conducive to sociability, the party, as a whole, cannot be said to have been, as
                    the French say, of âa mad gaiety.â The doctor did his best, but he had not the
                    light social touch. If he offered you the salad, it was with a portentous air;
                    or did he spread you a cushion, he never dropped his professional manner.</p>
                <p>Several untoward accidents marred what was left of the day. A young lady had
                    hysterics at the back of the ruin, and the doctor, who was fetched just when he
                    was showing me the view from the topmost turret, muttered something distinctly
                    ungallant about his prospective patient as he hurried off. A drizzle began just
                    as the tea was laid, and the rain fell in dismal earnest as we drove home to
                    Northaw.</p>
                <p>The next time I saw our friend Dr. Styles my head was tied up in a flannel shawl,
                    and my throat was so swollen that I could hardly speak. The doctor had been
                    called in professionally. The Northaw picnic had been too much for a Londoner
                    uninured to the climate, and I was down with a malignant sore throat.</p>
                <p>The doctor came evely day, and once he<pb n="79" xml:id="VAB7114-070"/> came
                    twice, to work a patent inhaler, and paint my throat with some mysterious
                    compound. He constantly changed the treatment; it was as if he never could do
                    enough. He even used to bring me flowersâand who ever heard of a doctor taking
                    his patient flowers? Daisy was convulsed with amusement. She said that, when she
                    was ill, she sometimes used to have to send for Dr. Styles two or three times
                    before he appeared, he was so busy.</p>
                <p>At the end of a week I was better, and in ten days I was quite well. I really
                    felt very grateful, for I knew that the doctor had saved me by his constant care
                    from a dangerous illness. I wonder if he took my gratitude forâsomething else?
                    Anyway, as I told Christina when she scolded me for the whole affair, it was not
                    my fault.</p>
                <p>The thing came quickly to a crisis. We were all invited to spend an evening at
                    the doctor's house. In the North they have a mysterious meal called âhigh tea,â
                    which is apparently a source of no little comfort and even of
                    self-righteousness. It enables the habitual partakers thereof to allude
                    witheringly to the late dinner indulged in by inhabitants of<pb n="80" xml:id="VAB7114-071"/> the South, and so, if you are invited out in Northaw,
                    be sure you will be regaled on tea and cold chicken (fearful mixture!), on hot
                    cakes, jam, marmalade, and currant buns. To this evening meal, then, we were
                    bidden by Dr. Styles.</p>
                <p>He lived alone with his sisters, who were curiously like him. They were all
                    stoutish, with nondescript features, and had solemn and somewhat stolid manners.
                    To see all four of them together inclined one to indecent mirth. It was
                    impossible to be more worthy, more dull, and more self-satisfied.</p>
                <p>They sat in a circle in the long drawing-room on rather uncomfortable chairs. All
                    three of the Misses Styles took great interest in church matters, or at least in
                    the curate, who was unmarried, and whom they consulted very often on the subject
                    of soup tickets and flannel petticoats. The curate, and a boy of about nineteen
                    years of age, with a shrill voice, were the other men of the party. Miss Styles
                    (the eldest of the three Misses Styles) was a capital housekeeper; everything
                    went like clockwork in the doctor's roomy house. The early dinner was served to
                    a minute. Two<pb n="81" xml:id="VAB7114-072"/> o'clock was the hour. If the
                    doctor were out, the meal proceeded with unfailing punctuality, a slice of
                    mutton being kept hot in the oven for the master of the house. On the long, bare
                    lavender-coloured walls of the drawing-room hung several water-colours by Miss
                    Louisa; indeed, the Misses Styles were considered to have a pretty taste for
                    art. They painted everything within reach with sprawling red roses or startling
                    white daisies, the doctor being of opinion that his sisters' artistic talent was
                    of the first order. Miss Ada, too, was musical, and sang songs by Pinsuti and
                    Milton Wellings. The doctor liked Miss Ada's vocal efforts. Miss Emily was
                    literary; at least, she assiduously read Miss Edna Lyall and Mr. Rider Haggard,
                    and of these authors we discoursed solemnly until âteaâ was announced.</p>
                <p>The table groaned with good things: with buttered toast, with salad, with vague
                    dishes covered with custard, with ham, with quivering blanc-mange. The curate,
                    it transpired, had a phenomenal appetite, though he coughed and expostulated
                    when helped to a third serve of pressed beef. Both he and the shrill-voiced<pb n="82" xml:id="VAB7114-073"/> boy had been among the abstaining sheep at our
                    picnic; this evening meal, therefore, washed down by tea and coffee, had
                    obviously no terrors for them. The conversation was not of the kind that
                    dazzles. There were frequent pauses, during which Miss Ada made several bald
                    statements about a forthcoming village concert, and the doctor, wishing to show
                    his knowledge of the town, solemnly inquired if I had seen Mr. Irving in
                    <title>Henry VIII.</title>?</p>
                <p>The air was full of ominous portents. The doctor's manner, when he invited me for
                    the second time to partake of cold chicken, or pressed upon me, with Northern
                    hospitality, the currant cake, was full of a certain protecting pride, while a
                    humbly conquering expression was in his eyes when they rested upon me. It was
                    with âintentionââas the French sayâthat he showed me the photograph album, full
                    of aunts and cousins, after tea. The good doctor looked quite sentimental when,
                    later on, Miss Ada warbled a romance with a waltz accompaniment, entitled âThe
                    Love that will Never Fade.â I began to feel restless. More than once did I cross
                    the room, engage either of the Misses Styles in feverish <choice>
                        <orig>con-</orig>
                        <reg>conversation</reg>
                    </choice><pb n="83" xml:id="VAB7114-074"/> versationâI always ended by finding
                    the doctor at my elbow. At last I resigned myself to my fate, and sat down to
                    talk to him. I imagined that the sanitary state of the suburb of Northaw would
                    be a safe subject, and one unlikely to lead to a declaration of a tender nature,
                    but inll this, it appeared, I was mistaken. We got on to the subject of fevers,
                    and, to convince me on a certain point, the doctor suggested a reference to one
                    of the medical books in his surgery. Once inside the little room, which lay just
                    across the passage, Dr. Styles shut the door and advanced towards me with that
                    particular expression which is so intolerable in a man one doesn't care for.</p>
                <p>I put on my most indifferent manner, and inspected with much interest the rows of
                    medical books in their glass case.</p>
                <p>âSo kind of you,â I said hurriedly, to fill up the dreadful pause, âto take so
                    much trouble<choice>
                        <sic/>
                        <corr>.</corr>
                    </choice> Most doctors only laugh at you if one wants to know any real
                    factâabout your dreadful trade,â I added with flippancy, seeing that the man was
                    not listening to a word I was saying, but was gazing at me as an amiable snake
                    might be said to regard a sparrow.</p>
                <pb n="84" xml:id="VAB7114-075"/>
                <p>âTrouble!â he said at last. âHow can anything be a trouble that is done for you?
                    I wish you would let me tell you how much Iâhow much Iââ</p>
                <p>A sharp rap at the door interrupted this speech. A servant came in.</p>
                <p>âPlease, sir, Mr. Brown is very bad, and Mrs. Brown says, will you come at once,
                    and bring some of the drops, and she hopes you won't be long.â</p>
                <p>âA three-mile drive!â said Dr. Styles with a sigh, âand I shall not see you again
                    to-night.â He took my hand and held it fast. âI will bring the book to-morrow
                    morning. Shall I have a chance of seeing you alone? Try to be alone when I
                    come,â and, wrenching my hand violently, the doctor disappeared.</p>
                <p>âDaisy,â I said hurriedly in the carriage going home, âI'm sorry to say, dear, I
                    shall have to go home by the 10.15 to-morrow. IâI had a telegram just before we
                    came out.â</p>
                <p>âYou had a fiddlestick! What nonsense, Peggy! Why, you came to stay a month, and
                    you've hardly been twelve days.â</p>
                <p>âTwelve days? Good heavens! Why, how has heâ?â</p>
                <pb n="85" xml:id="VAB7114-076"/>
                <p>âOh, it's that, is it? And so, you don't like him? Well, I think you're silly.
                    You might do much worse. How much better to settle down with someone like that
                    than with one of your flipperty London young men. He's sensible, clever, a good
                    fellow, well off, and very fond of youââ</p>
                <p>âThe 10.15, <emph>please</emph>, Daisy.â</p>
                <p>And, sure enough, by the 10.15 I went. As the Yorkshire fields flew behind me on
                    my rapid journey back to London, the whole thing seemed like some nightmare from
                    which I had just awoke. Great heavens! From what had I not escaped? A lifetime
                    of high tea, suburban gossip, and provincial self-sufficiency, of rose-bedecked
                    door-panels, the novels of Mr. Rider Haggard, and âThe Love that will Never
                    Fade.â</p>
                <p>I am very fond of Mrs. Drysdale, but it will be a long time before I again trust
                    myself to the seductions of that suburb of Mudchester.</p>

                <head>CHAPTER VII</head>
                <p><hi>IT</hi> was not very tragic. The first time I saw him and the last time I saw
                    him I laughed; and the interval was not unamusing.</p>
                <p>Quite suddenly he had become the fashion. Some great lady in LondonâI forget
                    whoâhad heard Claud Carson recite one of his own love songs at a concert got up
                    for a charity, and she had invited him to her house, where he had met other
                    women of fashion, and between themselves, in their little set, they had
                    determined to make him the mode. It was at one of the Duchess of Birmingham's
                    nicest partiesâone of her small musical eveningsâthat we first saw him.</p>
                <p>I had been away from town a month or two, and was out of touch with London
                    things, so that when someone said excitedly to me in the supper-room, âOh,
                    conime upstairs; Claud Carson is going to recite!â and I saw all the women<pb n="87" xml:id="VAB7114-078"/>
                    <pb n="89" xml:id="VAB7114-079"/> trailing out of the room at once, I turned to
                    the nearest young man to ask what it all meant.</p>
                <p>âOh, some cad with long hair, who rolls his eyes about, and recites erotic poems;
                    meet him at every blessed place you go to,â was the answer, as my informant
                    helped himself to plovers' eggs and reached for a fresh bottle of champagne.
                    Upstairs, however, in the music-room, there was a flutter of excitement. A Royal
                    Duchess was present: an event, coupled with the fact that this new artist was
                    going to perform, favouring that kind of electric buzz in the air which is so
                    precious to the ears of an anxious hostess. Round the grand piano was a line of
                    pretty women, all with their eyes turned towards the seated figure at the
                    music-stool. There was perfect silence as Mr. Claud Carson rippled a few chords
                    over the keys.</p>
                <p>I peeped over the shoulders of two or three people in front of me, and saw a
                    white face framed in long blonde hair, which fell in one straight lock across
                    the forehead. The eyes, which were fixed on the cornice of the ceiling, were
                    dark grey in colour, and full of what young ladies call âsoul.â The nose was
                    thin and straight,<pb n="90" xml:id="VAB7114-080"/> the lips full and
                    beautifully curved, the jaw rather square and pathetically thin. It was a face
                    out of a Burne-Jones picture.</p>
                <p>Then the long white hands moved rhythmically over the piano, and Claud Carson,
                    sweeping an ineffably weary glance along the line of pretty faces bent towards
                    him, finally fixed his gaze on the Royal Duchess, and began to recite, speaking
                    his words in a rather monotonous tone, to an accompaniment of ripples and
                    chords.</p>
                <p>âAh, he's going to do that charming thing from his âRoses of Passion,â the book
                    which he is just going to publish,â somebody whispered excitedly. âI like him
                    best when he recites his own poems.â</p>
                <p>First Mr. Claud Carson told us how he had met a young person in the twilight's
                    mellow time, and how the daisies had kissed her feet, but how she, swerving
                    beneath his glances, had flitted through the net-work fine, of buds which blow,
                    in hawthorn's glow; but eventually it appeared the lady had not proved so coy,
                    for in the second verse Mr. Carson very justly remarked:</p>
                <pb n="91" xml:id="VAB7114-081"/>
                <q>
                    <l>But if you linger in that place</l>
                    <l>Beneath the hawthorns' interlace,</l>
                    <l>And I may gaze upon your face,</l>
                    <l>Shall love forgo sweet passion's flow?</l>
                    <l>The stars alone look down on high,</l>
                    <l>The winds alone repeat your sigh,</l>
                    <l>No eyes our lonely tryst descry:</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">They little know, they little know.</l>
                </q>
                <p>Fans waved in time to the quaint rhythm, necks were craned forward, eyes drooped
                    and glistened, there were pensive smiles on curved lips. It was not very good,
                    but there was something magnetic about the strange performance. Claud Carson
                    effectually âfilled the stage.â While he was reciting it was impossible to look
                    in any other direction. <q>
                        <l>And if the second twilight break,</l>
                        <l>Faint bird-notes sweet the morning make,</l>
                        <l>And wond'rihg world now reawake</l>
                        <l>And life reflow, with love and woe;</l>
                        <l>The new day finds us parted, sweet,</l>
                        <l>And new worlds open at our feet,</l>
                        <l>Once strangeâas strangers shall we meet?</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">We little know, we little know.</l>
                    </q> He finished in a whisper which just filtered through his clenched
                    teeth.</p>
                <p>An elderly gentleman coughed severely, and a couple of young ones, with faces
                    as<pb n="92" xml:id="VAB7114-082"/> unemotional as their glistening
                    shirt-fronts, exchanged a swift expressive glance. The Royal Duchess beamed
                    approval, and signified that the reciter should be presented to her. The whole
                    performance was a delightful interlude in the decorous solemnity of her exalted
                    existence. I was the only woman in the room who laughed.</p>
                <p>âI suppose it's an acquired taste, like caviare or absinthe,â I said to a smart
                    woman near me; âbut one has got to get accustomed to it. Why does he play the
                    piano all the time if he's going to recite?â</p>
                <p>The smart lady surveyed me with a withering glance.</p>
                <p>âIt's the most charming thing in London,â she said; âClaud Carson is a delightful
                    person.â</p>
                <p>All heads were turned in the direction of the young poet as he stood talking to
                    the Royal Duchess, his beautiful eyes fixed on her face, while occasionally,
                    with a pretty, fatigued movement, he raised a white, graceful hand and pushed
                    back the lock of blonde hair from his forehead. Before the short conversation
                    was over, she had invited him to come and see her.</p>
                <p>âIt's stupid, hardly decent, and almost<pb n="93" xml:id="VAB7114-083"/>
                    incomprehensible,â said Christina, as we drove home; âso I shouldn't wonder if
                    he became the rage this season.â</p>
                <p>And sure enough he did. One found him everywhere one went, and I had grown quite
                    accustomed to the thrilling tones of his languorous voice, the enigmatic look in
                    his deep-set eyes, when one night he asked to be introduced to me.</p>
                <p>âEverywhere,â said Mr. Carson, as he dropped into a chair at my side, âeverywhere
                    I see your face.... But until to-night I did not know who you were,â he added
                    softly.</p>
                <p>His tone, his manner annoyed me.</p>
                <p>âPerhaps you didn't ask!â I suggested, though an instant later I was sorry that I
                    should have allowed myself to be flippant with a strange young man of whom I did
                    not altogether approve.</p>
                <p>And then he did something which showed that he was clever. He gazed at me in
                    perfect silence for several minutes, until the memory of my flippant words had
                    quite died away.</p>
                <p>âCome,â he said at last in his thrilling tones, âlet me give you some
                    strawberries.â</p>
                <p>I took his arm and went. We had a<pb n="94" xml:id="VAB7114-084"/> charming time
                    that night. Claud Carson was less absurd than he looked. Under his little
                    affectations there was a boyish, frank personality which was really attractive;
                    and when he could forget the fact that all the women in the room were staring at
                    him, and remember that he was not expected to keep up the character of a modern
                    MinnesÃ¤nger while he helped you to quails and plovers' eggs, he was a nice,
                    simple boy. Afterwards, by-the-bye, I heard that he was at least
                    eight-and-twenty; but he was one of those fair, clean-shaven individuals who
                    never look as if they had emerged from their teens.</p>
                <p>âI want to come and see you,â said Claud Carson that night, holding my hand as we
                    stood under the portico waiting for the carriage; âwhen may I come?â</p>
                <p>âWe are at home on Sundays at five.â</p>
                <p>âNot then, not in a crowd of people,â he pleaded. âI want to see youâalone.â</p>
                <p>âOh, in that case,â I answered, laughing, âdon't come on a Sunday. Comeâsay on
                    Wednesday. And then you will see Christina.â</p>
                <p>But Christina, when he finally appeared, found him impossible. She said that his
                    hands<pb n="95" xml:id="VAB7114-085"/> were too white, and that the shape of
                    his collar was revolting. She did not like his poems; generally, she did not
                    understand what they meant, and when she did, she said she wished she
                    hadn't.</p>
                <p>Claud Carson began to come a good deal. He was always dropping in at tea-time,
                    and he never failed to look reproachful if he found me pouring out tea for Mr.
                    Mandell, Val Redmond, or Tony Lambert. He would sit in a low chair, leaning
                    back, and regarding me with half-closed eyesâa habit which Christina declared
                    was insufferable. Indeed, she generally remembered she had letters to write when
                    Mr. Carson called.</p>
                <p>âI have come to offer you what I prize most in the world,â he said one day when
                    we were alone.</p>
                <p>âBut I never take thingsâanything but flowers, I meanâfrom people,â I objected,
                    hastily.</p>
                <p>âAh, but you willâyou mustâaccept this. I dedicate to you my âRoses of Passion,â
                    the firstborn of my brain. Dear child, they are yours.â He handed me a bit of
                    paper, on which was written:â</p>

                <p>We sat and talked for a long time in the twilight. It was the end of February,
                    and the late afternoon was tinged with the pale, wondering light of an early
                    English spring. The trees outside were swelling with purple buds, and through
                    the black branches there was the gleam of a tender, rosy sunset. It was the time
                    of confidences, and the kind of day one says all sorts of things one doesn't
                    mean, in a soft, regretful voice, just because they sound well and seem to fit
                    into the emotional hour.</p>
                <p>Claud Carson knelt on the window-seat, his<pb n="97" xml:id="VAB7114-087"/>
                    blonde head turned to pale gold against the window-pane.</p>
                <p>âYou have helped me more than any woman I have ever known,â he said at last, with
                    a sigh.</p>
                <p>âHave I?â I asked, touched, flattered, and pleased. I was at an age when a girl
                    likes to be called a âwoman.â âI'm sure I don't know how! What have I ever done
                    for you?â</p>
                <p>He gazed at me for a few seconds, and then turned abruptly away.</p>
                <p>âYou have made my life happier,â he said. In another instant he had pressed my
                    hand, and was gone.</p>
                <p>Christina's dry tones called me back to mundane things.</p>
                <p>âAnd so you have had that impossible young man here for hours,â said my sister,
                    bursting into the room with all the matter-of-fact and common-sense which an
                    afternoon out of doors brings with it. âMay I ask if you intend to make a fool
                    of him, too?â</p>
                <p>âTo make a fool of him! No, I don't think I shall ever be able to do that.â</p>
                <p>And my words, to be sure, came true.</p>
                <p>A little while after, we were driving one<pb n="98" xml:id="VAB7114-088"/>
                    afternoon towards Hammersmith, when suddenly the coachman pulled up. A huge dray
                    had got across the road, and for a few moments we were obliged to wait while a
                    small crowd urged the horses this way and that. We had stopped in a street of
                    small stucco houses, whose weedy front gardens were suggestive of anything but
                    rural delights. And then, as we waited, a thin, undersized child of seven ran
                    out of one of the open hall-doorsâa door which revealed a vision of a
                    perambulator, a shabby oilcloth, and a framed oleographâand hung staring over
                    the green-painted rails.</p>
                <p>â'Ow dare you? Come in directly, Ermyntrude,â said a querulous voice; and for an
                    instant I caught a glimpse of a rather good-looking young woman in a cheap
                    tailor-made gown. âI shall tell your father. You are a most disobedient child!â
                    A moment later a young man strode down the gravelled path, seized the undersized
                    child in his arms, kissed her, and carried her indoors. Just as he disappeared
                    in the doorway our eyes met. The young man was Claud Carson.</p>
                <p>âSo he is marriedâyour modern MinnesÃ¤nger,â said Christina drily, holding her
                    chin<pb n="99" xml:id="VAB7114-089"/> up and looking straight in front of
                    her as we drove on.</p>
                <p>âApparently,â I said, shrugging my shoulders and gazing at the coachman's back. I
                    was not to be outdone in imperturbability by Christina.</p>
                <p>âHe has married the landlady's daughterâpoets generally do. But it was
                    considerate of him,â she continued, with a twinkle in the corner of her eye, âto
                    leave his star in the blue vault, his lily in its garden,â seeing that he has
                    already got one lily and a promising bud or two in Khartoum Gardens,
                    Hammersmith.â</p>
                <p>And then we both fell back on the cushions and gave way to uncontrollable
                    giggles. I laughed till the tears ran down my cheeks.</p>
                <p>âWhen <emph>will</emph> you learn sense?â sighed Christina.</p>

                <p>â<hi>YOU</hi>
                    <emph>are</emph> so good and dear,â repeated Julian Clancy for the second time,
                    in his well-bred, drawling voice, detaining my hand for an instaut in the
                    obscurity of his tapestry-hung hall. Mother, who always remembers she has an
                    appointment in Hampstead or West Kensington just when one is beginning to enjoy
                    oneself, was already at the bottom of the garden path. Mr. Julian Clancy slowly
                    raised the hand he held to his lips. He was perfectly aware that this
                    last-century salute was considered irresistible by his women friends.</p>
                <p>He was a charming host. All the guests at Mr. Clancy's parties seemed on easy terms<choice>
                    <sic/>
                    <corr>.</corr>
                </choice> The men called each other by their Christian names; the ladies had
                    quaint little nicknames for their friends. An atmosphere of intimate chat hung
                    about the rooms. The women spoke in cooing tones, and had interminable
                    confidences to make, while the men laughed softly<pb n="101" xml:id="VAB7114-091"/> as they leant forward to listen with an amused air in
                    the veiled lamplight. It was distinctly a house where one enjoyed oneself.
                    Julian Clancy would ask a dozen peopleâmost of them well knownâand you would
                    find them, when you arrived, chatting with soft, intimate voices in obscure
                    corners, or loitering, as they whispered the latest malicious story, in the
                    draped doorways. Not that Julian Clancy himself ever listened to malicious
                    stories. Though he wrote novels of modern society, lived all the year round in
                    London, and was now over forty years of age, it was astonishing how guileless,
                    how optimistic, he remained. His vague face and worn smile suggested only the
                    most indefinite emotions, and yet the warmth of his language was extraordinary.
                    Everyone he knew was âa dearâ or âa dear person,â while the more favoured ones
                    were âso perfectly good and sweet.â Mr. Clancy would not listen to a word
                    against anyone. How <emph>could</emph> people be so horrid as to say that his
                    dear Lady Rougemont's beautiful red hair was dyed, or that his charming Charlie
                    Deuceace was not the most exemplary of husbands? People were <emph>so</emph>
                    unkind! Well off and well connected, he mixed in the<pb n="102" xml:id="VAB7114-092"/> best, as well as the rapidest, sets in London, but
                    what he really worshipped was the âcelebrity.â It is an error to suppose that
                    all the Leo Hunters are of the feminine sex. Julian Clancy always had the last
                    celebrityâand, failing that, the last notorietyâat his parties in St. John's
                    Wood.</p>
                <p>He adored St. John's Wood. Celebrated artists, actors, dramatists were all to be
                    found within a stone's throw of his door; he could run in and out of famous
                    studios, and catch distinguished actors for his little suppers on their way home
                    from the theatres. He tolerated a countess (if she happened to be amusing), but
                    a new dancing girl set him raving. He used to ask great ladies to meet the most
                    extraordinary people, and somehow or other they always came. His Sunday
                    dinnersâof eightâwere most amusing. One never knew if one would sit next to a
                    Guardsman, a burlesque actor, or the representative of a foreign Power. He knew
                    everybody, and everybody wanted to know him. The Honourable Julian Clancy,
                    second son of Lord Basingstoke, had a position in society which is not often the
                    lot of younger sons. But then, to be sure, his brother had no children,<pb n="103" xml:id="VAB7114-093"/> and was already separated from his wife. In
                    all human probability Julian would one day succeed to the earldom. And yet he,
                    for his part, was chiefly preoccupied with literary fame. Every other year or so
                    he published, at his own expense, a rather second-rate novel, which, however,
                    had one merit. It was usually in one volume, with fat print and wide margins, so
                    that when he presented it to his friends, with charming little enthusiastic
                    phrases written on the first page, they were able to get a good idea what it was
                    about without being at the pains to read it. About the time his book appeared,
                    he usually gave one of his pleasantest parties, where one saw him with one arm
                    round the neck of some young man who wrote reviews for the penny papers.</p>
                <p>In former days, when he was younger and less gushing, Mr. Julian Clancy had been
                    in the diplomatic service, and had wandered in many lands. He never wandered
                    now. As a matter of fact, he never left London. Every year, when other people
                    were making their autumn plans, he would point to his garden, with its
                    pear-trees and hollyhocks, its plashing fountain and cooing doves, and ask you <choice>
                        <orig>plain</orig>

                    </choice><pb n="104" xml:id="VAB7114-094"/> tively why he should leave it?
                    September, January, or June he would stroll down St. James's Street to his club
                    at five o'clock. Every year, as soon as August came, a paragraph went the round
                    of the gossipy papers chronicling the fact that Mr. Julian Clancy never left
                    town. People thought it so original and charming; he had quite a little
                    notoriety on that account alone. But London, to be sure, was a passion with him.
                    The pavement of Piccadilly was to him what the boulevard is to the Parisian. He
                    was miserable five miles from Bond Street, and I have known him to rave about
                    the exquisite effects one saw in a London fog. Julian Clancy made a cult of the
                    metropolis.</p>
                <p>His houseâin springtime buried in a white cloud of pear-blossom, in summer shady
                    with spreading chestnut-trees and limesâwas one of the prettiest things in town.
                    A low, two-storied cottage, with queer-shaped rooms built out at odd angles, it
                    was draped, arranged, and furnished with an artist's hand. His music-room, with
                    its polished floor and Oriental walls, contained nothing but a grand piano, a
                    huge spreading palm, and a low, downy divan running round the sides; but through
                    a Cairene<pb n="105" xml:id="VAB7114-095"/>
                    <pb n="107" xml:id="VAB7114-096"/> archway you stept into a drawing-room crowded
                    with nick-nacks, hung with old brocade, and as dainty as the boudoir of some
                    eighteenth-century beauty. In the dining-room the prim, thin Chippendale
                    furniture was ranged against a pale-coloured wall, while the round table, with
                    its fine damask and Georgian silver, and the soft lamplight illumining a great
                    bowl of flowers, was somehow suggestive of brilliant talk and dainty fare. But
                    Mr. Clancy was always modest about his possessions. âIt's so sweet of you to
                    like my things,â he would say deprecatingly to some fashionable lady who was
                    going round his rooms sniffing up ideas. âI <emph>never</emph> care for anything
                    I have. It's so <emph>good</emph> of you to like my poor little cottage.â</p>
                <p>He came very often to our Sunday evening parties, when, about twelve o'clock, one
                    saw his fatigued, expressionless features and his superb shirt-front appear in
                    the studio doorway. He was one of the men, by-the-bye, who look their best at
                    night, the sharp black and white of man's evening dress giving him a
                    distinction, an elegance, which he somewhat lacked. At first I did not know why
                    he came so often. Fatherâto whom he regularly offered up some<pb n="108" xml:id="VAB7114-097"/> of his choicest phrasesânever liked him, and took no
                    particular pains to conceal the fact. To mother all young menâespecially in the
                    eveningâare alike. She looks upon them as necessary evils at our parties, but
                    makes few distinctions between them. Christina was away that season, so there
                    remained only myself. As the years had passed on I had had experience enough to
                    know that a man who is heir-presumptive to an English earldom is not likely to
                    preoccupy himself with a middle-class damsel of modest dowry. What brought him,
                    then, so often to our house? Time, as usual, revealed the secret, and in this
                    wise.</p>
                <p>July, with its damp garden parties, was upon us. Mr. Julian Clancy's annual
                    outdoor fÃªte was one of the events of the late summer. He arranged the thing
                    charmingly, and people intrigued for cards to what was sure to be an amusing
                    party. This year it was rumoured he was to have the whole of the Frivolity
                    chorus girls, attired as milkmaids, to dance skirt dances on his velvety lawn.
                    So everybody wanted to go.</p>
                <p>For some time beforehand Mr. Clancy was<pb n="109" xml:id="VAB7114-098"/>
                    indefatigable in his calls at our house. He talked, as much as he ever talked
                    about anything of his ownâfor he was only enthusiastic about other people and
                    their parties, which were always âperfectly charmingâ or âtoo lovelyââof his
                    forthcoming entertainment.</p>
                <p>âI <emph>do</emph> so hope you'll come,â he said. âI want you <emph>all</emph> to
                    come. It would be so sweet and good of you all to come to my little party.â</p>
                <p>âOh, we don't go about in droves,â I said, laughing. âWon't one or two of the
                    family be enough?â</p>
                <p>âOf course I only insist upon you,â said Julian, with a shade of his old
                    diplomatic manner; âbut I should be so proud ifâyour father would come.â</p>
                <p>A light flashed over me. This, then, was a possible explanation of Mr. Julian
                    Clancy's devotion. He was hunting a celebrityâhe wanted my father! How dense I
                    had been, to be sure. Father was not only a famous and successful Royal
                    Academician, but he was one of the most amusing people in town.</p>
                <p>The day of the garden party I was all diplomacy and white muslin. Early in the
                    afternoon I captured my distinguished parent<pb n="110" xml:id="VAB7114-099"/>
                    and insisted on his accompanying me to St. John's Wood. I was not going to
                    appear without him, as a second-rate substitute for a celebrity.</p>
                <p>The sleepy suburban road was alive with carriages and cabs as we drove up, and at
                    every turn you nodded to some well-known face. The clean-shaven profile and
                    heliotrope necktie of Duncan Clive, the actor, were seen in a victoria side by
                    side with Lady Susan's extraordinary hat (her ladyship had long ago given up
                    chaperons as superfluous); Val Redmond, Tommy Singleton, and the pale-faced boy
                    foamed out of a hansom, all blue buttonholes and light gloves; the Duchess of
                    Birmingham was driving up in the ducal chariot, and had brought Miss Van Hoyt;
                    there was no end to the people one knew. Inside the house it was dark and hot,
                    and in the Oriental music-room you could hardly stand, for a famous prima donna
                    was lamenting, in a piercing soprano voice, and an indifferent Italian accent,
                    the absence of her beloved, while a small, red-haired cavalry major told a funny
                    story in a high, penetrating voice, until several people said âHush!â and turned
                    round and frowned.<pb n="111" xml:id="VAB7114-100"/> In the dining-room one saw
                    a vista of backs pushing and struggling over a buffet, and there was an acrid
                    odour of coffee and strawberries as you passed the open door to reach the
                    garden.</p>
                <p>Outside, the scene was pretty enough. In the green garden the pink, and mauve,
                    and white dresses of the women made clear patches on the verdure, and smiling,
                    fatigued faces greeted each other from under fantastic hats. A Viennese band
                    played beneath a huge cedar; the Frivolity girls, with their crinkled white
                    frocks and painted cheeksâlooking pinker than ever under their starched
                    sun-bonnetsâstood huddled together in the distance, and nudged each other as
                    they recognised several smart young men, who, with imperturbable faces, were
                    handing water-ices to the season's <foreign xml:lang="fre">dÃ©butantes</foreign>.</p>
                <p>Presently the band struck up a catchy air, and the girls, forming into a line
                    against a background of ivy, flipped their loose skirts and executed a series of
                    swaying movements with fixed, mechanical smiles. The youngestâa thing of seven,
                    with thin, pointed kneesâhad the most surprisingly wooden smile of all;<pb n="112" xml:id="VAB7114-101"/> she was like a miniature, but exaggerated,
                    copy of the showy girls who towered above her. There was a great deal of
                    applause when they had done, and only the smart young men appeared to be but
                    vaguely interested in the performance.</p>
                <p>Our host, as usual, was charming, but one felt that something distracting was in
                    the air. One saw it in Mr. Julian Clancy's preoccupied face as he gushed a
                    little over us both, making a civil effort when we entered. Something important
                    was going on inside the house, from the glances which our host kept turning
                    towards the open drawing-room windows. What could it be?</p>
                <p>We were not long left in doubt. âOh, have you heard?â cried Val Redmond,
                    detaining us with a delighted giggle. âNankowsky, the Russian who says he has
                    been to the North Pole, is in there in the drawing-room. He is such a delightful
                    person. They say he is a leper, but I don't believe that, though I dare say you
                    can catch it from the Esquimaux. If I were you I should only look at him through
                    the window, in case it <emph>is</emph> true, you know. He certainly is a very
                    odd colour.â</p>
                <pb n="113" xml:id="VAB7114-102"/>
                <p>This, then, was the reason of Mr. Clancy's tepid enthusiasm over father's
                    appearance. Nankowsky, the famous Nankowsky, was a very great celebrityâthe
                    newest of the seasonâand he was now holding an informal levÃ©e in the
                    drawing-room, where people were being introduced to him in shoals. Mr. Julian
                    Clancy, it was obvious, had forgotten his ardour for my father in the triumph of
                    securing a lion with a more penetrating roar.</p>
                <p>âDear,â I said twenty minutes later, when we had wandered round the garden,
                    shaking hands right and left, âI'm afraid this sort of thing bores you. Let's go
                    home and have tea together in the studioâjust you and I.â</p>
                <p>We looked for our host, but he was not visible. As we crossed the hall, however,
                    we saw his back for an instant through the open drawing-room door. He was quite
                    absorbed, and did not hear us going out. Mr. Julian Clancy was bending over the
                    new celebrity, and we could hear him saying, in his slow, well-bred tones:</p>
                <p>âIt was so <emph>good</emph> and <emph>lovely</emph> of you to come!â</p>

                <head>CHAPTER IX</head>
                <p><hi>IT</hi> was at the Royal Academy, at the private view, that I first saw Mr.
                    Albert Morris. Outside, the bright spring sunshine bathed Piccadilly with its
                    unaccustomed warmth, gilding the tiny crinkled leaves in the Green Park, making
                    blue shadows under the crowded omnibuses, and illuminating the clinking harness
                    of the horses which passed, in a continual procession, into the courtyard of
                    Burlington House.</p>
                <p>Inside, up the wide staircase, with its crimson carpets and its banks of flowers
                    and plants, all London was elbowing its way to the crowded galleries. People who
                    had intrigued successfully for a ticket wore a triumphant, satisfied smile; the
                    critics were preparing their most stolid, yet important air; women journalists
                    felt for their pencils and note-books, eagerly demanding the names of
                    over-dressed ladies; and the paintersâthe Royal Academicians and<pb n="115" xml:id="VAB7114-104"/>
                    <pb n="117" xml:id="VAB7114-105"/> the few famous âoutsidersâ who are invited to
                    the private view, collected in little knots round some much-discussed canvas,
                    or, plucking each other by the sleeve, hurried through the rooms in search of
                    some striking picture by an unknown brush.</p>
                <p>But Mr. Morris hurried neither here nor there, for he was a person of importance.
                    He stood in the middle of the big room, casting cursory glances at the pictures
                    on the walls, and shaking hands with a small procession of people who passed
                    incessantly in front of him; with fashionable ladies, who stopped to give him
                    several fingers, and then passed on with a well-turned phrase and a
                    non-committing smile; with journalists, judges, actors, and cabinet ministers.
                    We came upon him suddenly, father and I, and when I had been introduced, he
                    seemed all at once to have a great deal to say....</p>
                <p>Mr. Albert Morris was about fifty years old, and had a humorous eye. He was
                    rather fat and rather red, and I think his hair and moustache were very
                    carefully dyed. He was absurdly rich. One of the big weekly papers belonged to
                    him, and he owned a good many 9*9*<pb n="118" xml:id="VAB7114-106"/> shares in
                    the opera. Mr. Morris also bought pictures, and was invited nearly every year to
                    the Royal Academy banquet. Everything he touched turned to gold; he had the true
                    instinct of his race for money. Albert Morris made fabulous sums out of the most
                    unlikely things, and they say that he was once seen driving through the City in
                    a four-wheel cab piled to the ceiling with Argentine bonds. He never went
                    farther away from town than Brighton, in order to be always within an hour of
                    the Stock Exchange. But with all his money and his influence he was the simplest
                    of men, and had only two strongly developed tastesâa liking for a good story and
                    a pretty woman. His house in Piccadilly was, it is true, a little over-gorgeous;
                    but then he had left the furnishing and decorating to a well-known firm, who had
                    somewhat overdone the Louis XVI. period. Nobody, however, including the owner,
                    seemed to think there were too many carved gilt legs and florid brocades, and in
                    the celebrated white dining-room, with its panels by Chaplin, Mr. Albert Morris
                    used to give little suppers to Royalty.</p>
                <p>He was a self-made man, and he believed<pb n="119" xml:id="VAB7114-107"/> in
                    money. He had bought everything: his position, his influence, his friends, his
                    newspaper, his house, his pictures, his books and curios, the love of women, and
                    the devotion of his servants. There was only one thing he dreaded, and that was
                    a thing from which his millions could not save him. He was horribly afraid of
                    death. Possible accidents or illnesses were a constant anxiety to Mr. Morris: he
                    was childishly frightened of infectious diseases, he never went to bed without a
                    ladder outside his window in case of fire, and he never sat behindâor onâa
                    strange horse. If his little finger ached, or he caught a cold in the head, he
                    consulted the greatest physicians in London, and he always carried a tiny golden
                    flask containing brandy, for someone had once told him he had a weak heart. Poor
                    Mr. Morris, quaking in the midst of his millions! They found him one morningâbut
                    I am anticipating.</p>
                <p>Though of thoroughly Jewish origin, it was astonishing how British and patriotic
                    was my new friend Mr. Morris. His newspaper was Conservative and highly
                    orthodox, and in time of war-scares there was an uncompromising<pb n="120" xml:id="VAB7114-108"/> Jingoism in its leaders. They were inspired by the
                    proprietor. The Church, the State, the House of Lords (who knows if the
                    estimable little man may not have cherished hopes of a peerage himself?) were
                    the things that Mr. Morris believed in. In religion he did not tolerate Broad
                    Church, nor in politics any dallying with democrats. But these things, after
                    all, were but a pastime; the opera, especially during the last year or two, was
                    the serious preoccupation of his life.</p>
                <p>âCharmin' little girl of yours, Wynman,â I overheard him whisper to father as we
                    were moving on; âmight bring her one night to the opera, now. Always the same
                    box, you know. Pit tier, No. 100. Say Thursday;â and without waiting for an
                    answer, for he was evidently accustomed to having his wishes acceded to, Mr.
                    Morris slipped away, and was presently in deep confabulation with the Leader of
                    the Opposition.</p>
                <p>On the following Thursday we found ourselves in Mr. Morris's opera-box.</p>
                <p>It was a brilliant night. All the beauties, with all their tiaras on, were ranged
                    in dazzling groups round the house. Two famous sisters<pb n="121" xml:id="VAB7114-109"/> (one married to a marquis, and the other on the way
                    to espouse a German princeling) were dressed exactly alike, and exhibited
                    precisely the same pensive smile and the same drooping bouquet. They were,
                    however, to-night entirely alone, filling the large box with their pink sleeves
                    and their radiant beauty. Just above them, Lady Susan received a procession of
                    smart young men all the evening. One after the other, the smart young men were
                    convulsed with laughter; you could see their stolid faces getting pink and
                    crinkled as they bent forward to catch what the lady said. In the next box a
                    well-got-up mother and a pretty, badly-dressed girl shared the same cavalier
                    between them; it was impossible to tell which he admired the least. An elderly
                    lady, in pale blue satin and black pearls, exhibited a young and
                    sheepish-looking husband. Mr. Valentine Redmond was supposed to be occupying a
                    stall, but his little smirk and his huge white buttonhole appeared in every box
                    on the grand tier that night. A number of âculturedâ people in the stalls had
                    open books of the score on their knees, and never raised their heads to<pb n="122" xml:id="VAB7114-110"/> the stage all the evening. They were playing
                    <title>Tristan und Isolde</title>.</p>
                <p>Mr. Albert Morris swept with his glasses the crimson horse-shoe, on which the
                    white shoulders and clear dresses of the women made spots and dots of light, and
                    settled himself in his chair with a small grunt of approval. He felt, in a way,
                    responsible for that brilliant house; he was one of the people who had revived
                    the moribund opera, and had made it once more the most fashionable lounge in
                    London. True, he distrusted Wagner and all his works, but he knew there was
                    âmoney in himââfor a season. He was more proud of his sway behind the scenes
                    than of any other influence he possessed. He prided himself on discovering
                    budding Pattis and Melbas, on unearthing unknown tenors and discovering
                    baritones of genius. The <foreign xml:lang="lat">potins</foreign> of the
                    greenroom, the little quarrels behind the scenes, were, I verily believe, the
                    joy of his existence. He had always a good story to tell about the stars of the
                    company. To spring a new prima donna on the town was the height of his
                    ambition.</p>
                <pb n="123" xml:id="VAB7114-111"/>
                <p>One liked Mr. Albert Morris at once. He was immensely comic, and had a slow, fat,
                    drawling voice which made his stories irresistible. He was also delightfully
                    candid. Like all the men of his race, he was easily touched by music, and when
                    the famous soprano, in white satin, with her hair down her back, gave forth an
                    operatic lament, I noticed a large tear coursing its way down Mr. Albert
                    Morris's rubicund cheek and immaculate shirtfront.</p>
                <p>âAh, these things make me feel, Miss Wynman,â he whispered; âbut then, you see,
                    I'm a wicked old sinner. It's only you charming young ladies who are so
                    hard.â</p>
                <p>It was impossible not to laugh, especially when Mr. Morris put on a gold
                    pince-nez and, holding the book of words a long way off, tried to find out what
                    the story was.</p>
                <p>âWhat's it all about, now? Don't understand German. Oh, here we are. Act I.
                    â<hi>They tremble and convulsively put their hands to their hearts, then
                        again press them to their foreheads. Their eyes meet anew, sink in
                        confusion, and once more fasten on each other with looks of
                        increasing,passion.</hi>â Hum! ...<pb n="124" xml:id="VAB7114-112"/>

                            her to hint with fire), Deathlessly dearest!"</p>
                    </q> Ah! very unfortunate now, as she's going to marry the other Johnnie. Never
                    have any luck, these poor little heroines. Beautiful high that! ... She's in
                    great form to-night.â But later on Mr. Morris was again bewildered by the
                    language of the libretto, which he insisted on reading aloud: <q>
                        <l>ââO highest, wholest,</l>
                        <l>Fairest, fiercest,</l>
                        <l>Brimmingest bliss!</l>
                        <l>Priceless! peerless!</l>
                        <l>Fixed and fearless!</l>
                        <l>Blind and breathlessâ....</l>
                    </q> Now, I call that exaggerated, don't you know. Did you ever talk to Mrs.
                    Wynman like that now, Wynman? Nobody ever says that sort of thing to me.â</p>
                <p>But in spite of Mr. Morris's objections to the Wagnerian methods, our evening at
                    the<pb n="125" xml:id="VAB7114-113"/> opera ended amiably all round. Before
                    we separated that night he had given father a commission for a big canvas.</p>
                <p>âSamson and Delilahâ was to be the subject of the picture, for Mr. Morris had a
                    taste for the good old themes. And yet when the picture was half finished he
                    began to see that it was rather out of date for a modern house.</p>
                <p>âShould like you to put Miss Peggy in, now!â said Mr. Morris one day, as we all
                    three sat criticising the huge canvas. âNort suitable for Delilah, eh?â It was
                    one of his peculiarities that he pronounced ânotâ and âgotâ like ânortâ and
                    âgort.â âWant a more robust model? Nort at all. Just the sort of little girl
                    like Miss Peggy.â But father was inexorable. I had sat to him as a Bacchante, as
                    a village maiden, and as a nun, but for Delilah he would have none of me. Mr.
                    Morris was obviously disappointed.</p>
                <p>He used to be always dropping in to see how âSamson and Delilahâ was getting on,
                    and he not infrequently stayed to lunch. âCharmin'âhashed muttonâjust what I
                    like. Anythin' does for me. Gort a passion for baked potatoes, dear,â declared
                    Mr. Morris, who feasted like Lucullus at home. It was<pb n="126" xml:id="VAB7114-114"/> another of his peculiarities, by-the-bye, that he
                    usually addressed the whole female sex as âdear.â Mr. Morris chaffed everybody,
                    from the editor of his paper to the cabman who drove him to the City. He even
                    chaffed Christina.</p>
                <p>On one celebrated occasion, when Christina had turned vegetarian, she sat eating
                    nothing but watercress, lettuce, and endive all through lunch.</p>
                <p>âMy heavens!â said Mr. Morris at last, adjusting his eyeglass, and regarding
                    Christina placidly munching a third plate of raw green stuff, âis this a
                    beautiful woman or <emph>a rumminatin' animal</emph>?â</p>
                <p>From that day forward Christina ate fish, meat, and fowl like the rest of the
                    family.</p>
                <p>âSamson and Delilahâ was finished at last, and to celebrate the hanging of the
                    picture there was to be a little supper in the white dining-room in Piccadilly,
                    at which a Royal personage was expected to be present.</p>
                <p>But Mr. Morris was not to eat his supper with Royalty in Piccadilly that night.
                    On the morning of the partyâa foggy November dayâMr. Morris's valet drove up to
                    our door in a<pb n="127" xml:id="VAB7114-115"/> hansom. His white, twitching
                    face told us the worst. Albert Morris was dead.</p>
                <p>And so, after all, his millions had not been able to save him from what he
                    dreadedâa sudden and a comparatively early death. The servant's scared face was
                    painful to see; he had been genuinely attached to Mr. Morris, and he had entered
                    his room that morning with tea and letters to find the electric light still
                    burning, and the figure of his master propped up in bed with a book in the hand
                    that had been cold for many hours. It was a French book, the valet said; âFort
                    comme la Mortâ he thought the name was. Albert Morris had drawn his last breath
                    while reading his favourite author.</p>
                <p>And that was the end.... One had a choky feeling in the throat when one thought
                    of it.... Of course, in stories and plays it is only the death of the young, the
                    handsome, and the virtuous which is meant to rouse our deepest pity. Yet in real
                    life it is often the figure of an Albert Morrisâstout, genial, worldly, rolling
                    in wealth, and terrified at deathâwhich most readily claims our tears. Of the
                    earth earthy, we can only picture them in their<pb n="128" xml:id="VAB7114-116"/> clubs or at our dinner-tables. In the grand drama of death it seems
                    impossible that they should ever take a partâthey, the heroes of half a dozen
                    farces, the authors of half a hundred <foreign xml:lang="fre">mots</foreign>.</p>

                <p>â<hi>I'M</hi> surprised, now, that you English ladies don't come oftener on our
                    side. I should surmise that young ladies have a better time in America than
                    anywhere else on this earth. The deference paid to Woman in the United States is
                    one of the most remarkable of our national characteristics. I tell you, you find
                    it in every relation of life. There's this Divorce âactâ now; a manâin
                    Americaâwill allow his wife to get a divorce from him if they find that they
                    can't agree; he would not think of letting his wife take the blame. I should
                    say, now, that that sort of thing was unheard of in this country. Your men, now,
                    I should judge, would not be apt to take the blame on themselves. I have been
                    much struck, though, with the splendid physical appearance of your young men.
                    Why, in Rotten Row I have seen more remarkable-looking men in one<pb n="130" xml:id="VAB7114-118"/> morning's walk, than I should be apt to see in a week
                    on Fifth Avenue or Broadway. Your tailors, now, they are one of the most
                    remarkable of your institutions, if one may say so. You English ladies, too, are
                    just perfectly lovely. Your high-bred repose is perfectly fascinating; and you
                    are, I should judge, more affectionate than American women? I should say, now,
                    that you had more heart? The trouble is that our society girls don't begin to
                    have any. Why, there was an English nobleman, Sir John Lacklands, in New York
                    last winter. That man was over seventy-two years of age. Well, he is about to be
                    married to one of the youngest buds of this season, the daughter of one of our
                    most prominent railroad kings<choice>
                        <sic/>
                        <corr>.</corr>
                    </choice> Why, the night before I sailed from New York I went to see a girl in
                    Madison Avenue, and there was a handsome young fellow of three-and-twenty there
                    who had been calling every evening at that house for some weeks. When he left, I
                    thought I should congratulate her on her engagement. âWhy,â said she, âwhat
                    queer, old-fashioned ideas you do have. Well, I don't know but what I'm thinking
                    of marrying, but I guess it's his grand-<pb n="131" xml:id="VAB7114-119"/>
                    father, the millionaire, who's to be the happy man.ââ</p>
                <p>Christina and I gasped, as Mr. Elisha Van Schuyler at last paused, though
                    apparently more to point his story than to take breath.</p>
                <p>In appearance he was tall, but not so broad-shouldered as an Englishman of his
                    height would have been, he had a dapper little pointed beard and moustache, and
                    keen, intelligent eyes. His coat was made by a tailor in Savile Row.</p>
                <p>We had never seen an American gentleman. Transatlantic women we had met by the
                    score; admired their gowns, laughed at their stories, and secretly envied their
                    unfailing vivacity; but none of the New Yorkers and Philadelphians that we had
                    known in London had ever appeared to have, or seem to have wasted a thought on,
                    any male belongings. Therefore, when Mr. Elisha Van Schuyler presented himself
                    with a letter of introduction from her Grace of Birmingham (who had known him in
                    her early days in America), it was with a feeling of keen curiosity that we
                    undertook to show him the studio and its contents.</p>
                <p>Our studio is one of the âshowâ ones of<pb n="132" xml:id="VAB7114-120"/> London,
                    and if Mr. Van Schuyler's face fell a little when confronted with papa's
                    portraits, he was lavish in his admiration of the beautiful room. âWe don't
                    begin to have anything like this in New York,â he said, giving a comprehensive
                    look round. âOur artists either can't afford to furnish a studio (nobody buys
                    American pictures on our side), or else they sort of overdo the thing. Too much
                    tapestry, too many suits of mail, too many mandolins, and too many ivory
                    crucifixes. There was a man who studied in Paris, and thought he'd go home and
                    do the âsociety actâ as well as paint portraits of the âfour hundred.â Well,
                    that man was as much fun as a goat. He just got as thin as a rail and as bald as
                    a coot trying to work the âsociety racket.â I tell you, he had a rocky time. He
                    took a huge studio in one of the most fashionable parts of New York, furnished
                    it perfectly elegantly, and began by painting one of our society bellesâfor
                    nothing. Then he used to lend his studio to Polish pianists and Spanish
                    dancing-girls, just to get the âfour hundredâ inside his house; and they used to
                    crowd right in, and drink his tea and his punch, and go right away and get
                    their<pb n="133" xml:id="VAB7114-121"/>
                    <pb n="135" xml:id="VAB7114-122"/> portraits painted by a third-rate Frenchman
                    who had fixed up an atelier next door. Why, I tell you, that Frenchman ââ and
                    here Mr. Van Schuyler was fairly launched on another stream of talk, which
                    lasted, without intermission, until he rose, rather abruptly, to go. First he
                    made us a low bow, a bow so deep that I have only seen it equalled by that of a
                    Russian <foreign xml:lang="fre">attachÃ©</foreign>, and then he reconsidered the

                    He was evidently under the impression that this was the latest mode of
                    salutation.</p>
                <p>When the heavy tapestry curtains had finally swung back behind him, Christina
                    called my attention to the fact that, both together, we had only been allowed to
                    put in three sentences, so entirely had our Transatlantic guest monopolised the
                    conversation. âI thought they always said that American women did all the
                    talking,â said Christina drily; âbut this young man seems to have a fancy for
                    monologues. I timed one of his stories, that about General Horace Porter
                    andâwhat's the other man's name?âChauncey Depew, and it lasted exactly seventeen
                    minutes by the clock.<choice>

                <p>âNever mind that,â I retorted, âthis American is going to be amusing.â</p>
                <p>And in truth he turned out to be charming. After a while, when he took to coming
                    pretty often, even Christina did not mind the length of Mr. Van Schuyler's
                    anecdotes. He had, as I took occasion to point out to Christina more than once,
                    that desirable thing in man or woman, a âtwinkling eye,â and he had also a
                    pretty taste in flowers and bonbonniÃ¨res, and a perfect mania for giving theatre
                    parties, with dainty little suppers afterwards. And later on, when we knew him
                    better, he had an inexhaustible fund of excellent, if slightly irreverent,
                    stories.</p>
                <p>He had his little peculiarities, to be sure. He was never tired of asking
                    questions about the Royal Family and the House of Lords, and onceâone night when
                    we were all dining with him at the Savoyâhe made us write out a list of English
                    duchesses, to see how many there were.</p>
                <p>âBut I don't know any,â I objected, âexcept the Duchess of Birmingham, and she's
                    an American.â</p>
                <pb n="137" xml:id="VAB7114-124"/>
                <p>âMercy! We don't count her,â said Mr. Elisha Van Schuyler.</p>
                <p>He was fond of asking tiresome questions, too, about the birthplaces of famous
                    people in London; and he never looked at me, I am convinced, without seeing me
                    against a fancy background of the Tower, Windsor Castle, and Stratford-on-Avon.
                    I sometimes feel that he expected me to live up to a famous past.</p>
                <p>But Mr. Van Schuyler's stay in London was not without its distractions. He wanted
                    to know everybody, and everybody seemed pleased to know him; he wished all his
                    friends to âhave a good timeââat his expense. He was generosity itself. One
                    could not express the vaguest wish without its being immediately carried out.
                    His generosity even took the form of inviting his rivals to dinner, and, what
                    astonished me even more, sending one in with them. There was nothing mean or
                    narrow-minded about our new American friend. And yet, though expansive and
                    voluble, we seemed to know him no more intimately at the end of three months
                    than at the end of his first call. Was there, under all his gregariousness, a
                    deep-seated reserve? Christina<pb n="138" xml:id="VAB7114-125"/> thought that,
                    on the whole, she preferred people who talked less and who said more. He had, to
                    be sure, an enormous admiration for Englishwomenâespecially the sort of young
                    woman who rides to hounds, sculls a boat, and bags her own grouse. He constantly
                    assured us that, if we would âcross the herring-pondâ and spend a winter in New
                    York or Washington, we should at once attain the rank of âraging belles,â though
                    we as constantly disclaimed all intention of competing with the home-grown
                    article on the other side of the Atlantic. But every day, as July verged on
                    August, and everyone was thinking of the moors, and Homburg, and Aix, Mr. Van
                    Schuyler grew more and more civil. He looked unutterable things. Hardly a day
                    passed without a gorgeous bunch of roses being sent. I began to wonder what life
                    was like in New York; if it was all roses, and devotion, and boxes at the play?
                    My family began to regard me with unwonted tenderness and consideration, and it
                    was obvious that they half expected Mr. Elisha Van Schuyler might carry me off
                    by the next ocean greyhound. Qualms of conscience-an unwonted <choice>

                    more than once I asked myself whether I liked this young man chiefly for himself
                    or for his dollars, when that little dinner put an unexpected end to my
                    doubts.</p>
                <p>It was at Hurlingham that the last act of the comedy was played. The polo ground
                    was thick with wide-sleeved, slim-looking women, and with broad-shouldered
                    military men, whose necks were bronzed by Indian suns. Here one caught the
                    profile of some country-bred girl, with neat, fair plaits tucked away under a
                    straw hat, and there a radiant vision of dainty laces and a delicate rose-pink
                    visage half hidden under a vast parasol. Carefully made-up old men walked
                    mincingly along. ogling the prettiest faces as they passed, and mentally
                    comparing the beauties of 1892 with those more fascinating young creatures of
                    thirty years ago. It was a mild, grey-skied afternoon of mid-July, and the sound
                    of the Coldstream Guards' band came softly over the lime-scented air. On the
                    lawn in front of the club-house the white-jacketed waiters ran quickly to and
                    fro with trays of tea and strawberries, and the checkered light of the<pb n="140" xml:id="VAB7114-127"/> huge Chinese umbrellas over the tables threw
                    curious little shadows on the faces of the tea-drinkers. All around, pretty
                    women were nodding and smiling at their bachelor friends. Over yonder, the new
                    beauty was obviously being made love to by somebody else's husband; while inside
                    the cool, carpetless clubhouse could be seen the profiles of an elderly, painted
                    personage in a muslin gown with pink ribbons, and of a bored, handsome young man
                    who was endeavouring to make peace with the irate lady. At the next table, two
                    smart City men were lighting their cigarettes after tea.</p>
                <p>Mr. Van Schuyler was more than usually confidential that afternoon. He told me
                    how he was âjust perfectly fascinatedâ with London and with London girls; how he
                    should like to live here (with a sigh), and how, if he couldn't do that, he
                    meant to come âjust all the time.â He had had, thanks to us, a perfectly
                    beautiful time. He should never forget it.</p>
                <p>Somebody had given a dinner, after the polo, and now we were sitting on the
                    terrace drinking our coffee, listening to the metallic music of the Hungarian
                    band, and watching<pb n="141" xml:id="VAB7114-128"/> the stars appear one by one
                    above the fat, bronze-coloured elms. Mr. Elisha Van Schuyler drew his chair a
                    little closer to mine.</p>
                <p>âI wonder now, if you would like Tuxedo? Like most American things, it's on a
                    larger scale than anything you have on this sideââ</p>
                <p>âLarger or not,â I said hastily, âI shall never see it. You know I am always
                    sea-sick. I shall never cross the Atlantic.â</p>
                <p>âWell, now, I call that rough on us! I had just made up my mind that when we were
                    marriedââ</p>
                <p>âMarried, Mr. Van Schuyler?â</p>
                <p>âWhy, yes. I guessâ (now and again, when he forgot he was in London, Mr. Van
                    Schuyler would let drop an occasional âguessâ) âMamie and I must fix it up soon,
                    if we are ever going to. Mamie's a society girl in Buffalo, and although I'm
                    willing she should have a good time as long as ever she wants to, still, I think
                    three years is long enough for a fellow to be kept waiting. Don't you agree with
                    me, Miss Peggy?â</p>
                <p>For a minute I was too astonished to speak. âYâes,â I hastened to say. 'Three
                    years <emph>is</emph> rather a long time. But then you've managed,<pb n="142" xml:id="VAB7114-129"/> haven't you, to have ... a fairly good
                    timeâyourself?â</p>
                <p>âWell, I should smile! I imagine Mamie would allow that I had better keep my hand
                    in all the time. And when we settle down in New York (I've been sending
                    cablegrams about a house on Fifth Avenue all this week) I hope you'll come over
                    and make us quite a long visit. Why, you would be just a raging, tearing
                    belle.â</p>
                <p>I smiled, and said I should have to make Mrs. Van Schuyler's acquaintance over
                    here; and so we talked it over, and I proffered my congratulations, while Mr.
                    Van Schuyler took my hand and held it very hard as he informed me that he meant
                    to settle down in double harness and be a model husband.</p>
                <p>Next year he brought his wife to see us. At first sight she revealed herself as a
                    restless, talkative, flirtatious little person, who had, like her husband, a
                    passion for having âa good time.â She had brought a cousinâa young manââalong,â
                    as she explained, so her husband shouldn't have to go around shopping with her.
                    He always got mad when she went shopping. She expected it was poky, anyhow,
                    going<pb n="143" xml:id="VAB7114-130"/> around all the time with your own
                    wife.... If he didn't like the young man, she didn't care, any way. He was just
                    perfectly sweet.... Mr. Van Schuyler (she always alluded to her husband as Mr.
                    Van Schuyler) was just perfectly devoted to Miss Peggy; he had never allowed
                    anything to interfere with his affection for Miss Peggy. And English young
                    ladies were perfectly lovely, any way. Mrs. Van Schuyler did not believe in
                    trying to make one's husband domestic. If he didn't care for domesticity,
                    neither did she. She just despised it, and meant to live in a hotel.</p>
                <p>While Mrs. Van Schuyler was there her husband was strangely silent. But it turned
                    out, on investigation, that he did not appear to find the bond of wedlock
                    galling. She allowed him plenty of rope, and he was always to be found straying
                    about at the very end of the tether. So far, I have not heard of either of the
                    Van Schuylers having applied for a divorce.</p>

                <p><hi>AFTER</hi> breakfast there was nothing pleasanter one could do than to sit
                    out in the gravelled garden of the hotel under the palm-trees, and, unfurling a
                    green-lined umbrella, to bask like a cat in the warmth. And it was here,
                    generally with an offering of flowers, that M. RenÃ© Levasseur used to join us,
                    with his English sailor hat, his gauzy Parisian tie, and a shepherd's plaid
                    shawl gracefully disposed round his shoulders. Skirmishing and giggling heralded
                    his approach. He was on intimate terms with everybody in the hotel; he had
                    confidences for the landlady, bon-bons for the children, and, if I am not
                    mistaken, a special greeting for the âboots.â</p>
                <p>In appearance he was hardly a typical Frenchman. Blond, thin, and pale, he had
                    only the beginnings of a beard, while his slightly stooping shoulders betrayed
                    the habit of <choice>

                    one of the new school of <foreign xml:lang="fre">vibristes</foreign>. He did the
                    most extraordinary little landscapes, all in pink, and mauve, and arsenic-green
                    stripes, which looked well enough about ten yards off, but which were
                    bewildering enough, to our British eyes, when inspected at close quarters. Other
                    French painters, however, were enthusiastic over his work. âTiensâtrÃ¨s fort, ce
                    garÃ§on!â they would say, gazing at a mountain put in with mauve and
                    rose-coloured lines; âbeaucoup de v'lan; trÃ¨s-amusant. Il est dans le mouvement,
                    celui-lÃ ; il tient de Monet.â Accustomed to the treacly sunset landscape, as
                    depicted annually on the walls of Burlington House, we were not a little amazed
                    at M. Rend's âvibrationsâânotes of dazzling sunlight and white open air. Like
                    most of his painter-compatriots, he was very amusing. For the French artist,
                    unlike his English brother, has a number of theories, which he can usually
                    express in a more or less attractive way. To be sure, he is generally a
                    pessimist; but to mention this is only to say that the French artist is
                    eminently modern. And if M. RenÃ© was a pessimist, he was an<pb n="148" xml:id="VAB7114-134"/> infinitely diverting one. He was one of the very few
                    young men of our acquaintance who amused Christina.</p>
                <p>First we were civil to him because we thought he was rather clever and
                    impecunious; but we learnt, later on, that he was rich, and that the cheap
                    sailor hat and faded shawl were part of his pose.</p>
                <p>âFrenchmen, whatever you may say against them, are never snobbish,â I announced
                    one day to Christina. âWhen do you ever hear them talk about their money?â</p>
                <p>âNo, just as in England it is bad taste to talk of one's religion. Money is their
                    religion, you know.â</p>
                <p>It was our first winter in the South. The spell of the Riviera was over us. The
                    lazy days crept by, filled with the scent of violets, the warmth of the
                    sunshine, the magnificent panorama of the littoral. Our nights were devoted to
                    cotillons, but I never could remember afterwards what we did during those sunny
                    days.</p>
                <p>Our painter, who had claimed our acquaintance from having seen father's pictures
                    in the âgreat, the unique, the epoch-making Exposition<pb n="149" xml:id="VAB7114-135"/> of 1889,â was always turning up. Even before the
                    mid-day breakfast, he would run down to the harbour to see the English yachts
                    come in or out, or stroll with us to the flower market, and come back with his
                    arms full of mimosa, anemones, and violets. Or he would take us both off for a
                    day's painting in the mountains; at least, he and Christina used to paint, and I
                    used to lie on my back and look on, and eat the sweetmeats which he thoughtfully
                    provided.</p>
                <p>One day M. RenÃ© painted me. He did me in a scarlet gown, with a scarlet parasol,
                    in full sunlight, against the blue Mediterranean, and I remember he painted my
                    face in scarlet and purple zigzags. Even my worst enemy has never accused me of
                    vanity, but I must say I was annoyed.</p>
                <p>âDo not be afraid, Mademoiselle. I shall send it to New York. You will never see
                    it again. Those good Americans only speak of our school. Every millionaire of
                    New York desires a Claude Monet, or, failing him, one of his disciples,â said M.
                    RenÃ© soothingly; and, to be sure, on reflection, it did not mratter much if my
                    face appeared like a gaily-coloured zebra on the other side of the Atlantic.</p>
                <pb n="150" xml:id="VAB7114-136"/>
                <p>But it was at night, when we went to dance at one of the villas or one of the
                    hotels, that M. RenÃ© was in his element. Even your most pessimistic Frenchman
                    will valseâif you give him the chance. He danced madly, breathlessly,
                    abominably; but, as a leader of cotillons, our painter was quite unapproachable.
                    His tact, his <foreign xml:lang="fre">finesse</foreign>, his gaiety were
                    admirable. How easily we amused ourselves during those winter nights! The drives
                    back, after the ball, along the bay, packed into the small hotel omnibus, with
                    our hands full of toys and ribbons and flowersâthe spoils of the eveningâwhile a
                    large white moon lit up the coast, and the pink and yellow villas were hushed
                    for the night among the orange-trees and palms. How pleased M. RenÃ© looked when
                    I brought home a lapful of tinsel ribbons and tea-roses! He had begun to assume
                    little airs of semi-proprietorship which were amusing; I think he already
                    suspected me of cherishing a hopeless passion for him.</p>
                <p>âTenez, je vous aime bien, Mlle Marguerite,â said M. RenÃ© one day; âvous savez
                    bien que je suis fou de vous. Mais ... je ne voudrai pas vous Ã©pouser ... mais
                    non, mais non!</p>
                <pb n="151" xml:id="VAB7114-137"/>
                <p>âMuch obliged to you, but I'm sure I don't want you to do so!â I replied, with
                    some acerbity. I always answered him in English. The French tongue is not my
                    strong point, but when I speak my native language to a foreigner I invariably
                    shout. âWithout being indiscreet, M. Levasseur, may I ask why?â</p>
                <p>We were climbing, through some orange-groves, up a hill, and the glistening green
                    leaves overhead were powdered with bloom and heavy with fruit. He tore a spray
                    of orange-blossom down, and stuck it gingerly through my plaits. âTrÃ¨s jolie, la
                    mariÃ©e,â he said, laughing; âmais trÃ¨s difficile Ã  amuserâO, mais bien
                    difficile.â</p>
                <p>There was a fatuity about this little scene which made me thoughtfulâfor a week.
                    Not that I alone was suspected of inclining my eyes in our painter's direction.
                    No one, however unlikely, was safe in this regard, no one, from the stout,
                    elderly landlady to the youngest school-girl in the hotel. We were one and all
                    supposed to take a tender interest in his proceedings. But I never realised this
                    quite until the night of the <foreign xml:lang="fre">tableaux vivants</foreign>,
                    from which<pb n="152" xml:id="VAB7114-138"/> moment I fancy M. RenÃ© was
                    convinced of my hopeless attachment.</p>
                <p>He was invaluable in our <foreign xml:lang="fre">tableaux vivants</foreign>. We
                    did it all between us, he and I, and it involved the sending of dozens of notes
                    on M. Rene's part; weird little missives, written half in French, half in
                    English, which were sufficiently bewildering at first:ââMerci, dear friend, de
                    votre amabilitÃ©. C'est donc convenu? Vous me prÃªtez une queue, et je serai une
                    bÃªte tout Ã  fait convenable. On rÃ©pÃ¨te aujourd'hui Ã  quatre heures. Il y aura du
                    thÃ©. En seriez-vous de la petite fÃªte?âWery faithfully yours, RENÃ
                    LEVASSEUR.â</p>
                <p>âWeryâ was nice enough as an example of âEnglish as she is spoke,â but M. RenÃ©'s
                    devotion was expressed in other extraordinary English phrases which he had just
                    missed catching from English ladies in pensions and hotels. Nothing would remove
                    the impression that âmy dearlingâ was a proper and ordinary way of addressing a
                    woman.</p>
                <p>Like most Frenchmen he had no self-consciousness (the absence of this defect was
                    made up for, I suppose, by exaggerated personal vanity); he had, therefore, no
                    more objection to<pb n="153" xml:id="VAB7114-139"/> making himself a false
                    stomach with two or three sofa-cushions than he had to putting on a cardboard
                    nose or running about on all-fours. As the âBeast,â indeed, he was delightful,
                    wearing my new sable boa as a tail, and wooing âBeauty,â in the person of our
                    schoolgirl, with quite irrepressible ardour. In our âPierrotâ scenes, too, he
                    was charming, taking my infidelities (as Pierrette) with the prettiest grace in
                    the world. The whole thing was quaint, artistic, delightful. M. RenÃ© was the
                    hero of the ball that followed. We were to leave the next day.</p>
                <p>The morning broke grey and stormy, and great waves tipped with white were lashing
                    the pebbles on the beach as I sat in the hotel garden, tired after our late
                    night. Christina had insisted on remaining upstairs to superintend the
                    packing.</p>
                <p>Presently something dark fell in my lap. It was a bouquet of votive violets,
                    while M. RenÃ©'s quizzical face at an open window above announced to me my
                    assailant.</p>
                <p>âComment, toute seule?â In a moment a leg appeared over the balcony, something
                    bounded out, and M. RenÃ© was bowing low in front of me.</p>
                <pb n="154" xml:id="VAB7114-140"/>
                <p>âPauvre Mees Marguerite!â he murmured.</p>
                <p>âWhy âpoorâ Miss Marguerite?â I asked in a high voice, so as to make sure that he
                    understood.</p>
                <p>âVous vous en allezâcomme Ã§a, en Angleterre? C'est si tristeâlÃ -bas.â</p>
                <p>âOh no, it isn't. We are going back to the London season, you know. We manage to
                    amuse ourselves over there, although you can't imagine it, immersed as we are in
                    the outer darkness.â</p>
                <p>And then M. RenÃ© told me of his hopes of a visit to London some day, when the
                    stormy waters of the Channel should have subsided enough for him to adventure on
                    the wild and desperate journey. He told me of the experiences of a friend of his
                    in London, of a fortnight spent at a French hotel near Leicester Square; of the
                    hideosities of the English Sunday, of the flat-soled boots of <foreign xml:lang="fre">ces dames</foreign>, of the equally unexciting conversational
                    efforts of <foreign xml:lang="fre">ces messieurs</foreign>; all the prejudices
                    and preconceptions which the Parisian packs up in his portmanteau on leaving
                    Paris and retains intact on his return to his beloved capital.</p>
                <pb n="155" xml:id="VAB7114-141"/>
                <p>âAh, but London is charming all the same,â I objected.</p>
                <p>The wind had dropped, and the sun was already turning the sea-pines to a delicate
                    greenish-silver. The dayâour final dayâwas to be fine after all.</p>
                <p>But it was time to go. We were not, however, to leave in the ordinary and
                    conventional way, in a hotel omnibus and an express train, but a large party of
                    people were to drive us in brakes and carriages to the Italian frontier, and we
                    were all to dine together at Ventimiglia before we took the train for Genoa. M.
                    RenÃ© sat close behind me in the brake, and whispered reassuringly into my ear as
                    we dashed along the mountain road with the Mediterranean spread out below us and
                    the rocky heights to the left. At the vine-covered trattoria, where we stopped
                    to drink Chianti and to rest the horses, it was M. RenÃ© who was so anxious we
                    should all dance a farewell valse in the dusty and deserted <foreign xml:lang="fre">salon</foreign>, while someone strummed a tune on the
                    jingling, worn piano, which only woke up once a week, when the peasants danced
                    on Sundays. At Ventimiglia, where we all walked out to see the view, our<pb n="156" xml:id="VAB7114-142"/> painter grew sentimental, and at dinner, at
                    the hotel, I think he managed to shed a tear.</p>
                <p>But everything comes to an end. Dinner was over, and now we were already in the
                    railway carriage, with our friends crowding round the open door. And what a
                    charming leave-taking it was! Everybody brought a farewell gift; a bunch of
                    roses, a basket of peaches, a Spanish fan, a china frogâevery kind of trifle
                    that one can giveâand takeâwithout being compromised. The engine was snorting,
                    mother was snugly ensconced, and Christina was getting out her favourite books;
                    the guards had three times announced the imminent departure of the train, and
                    still M. RenÃ©, climbing once more into the carriage, knelt, in mock tragedy, at
                    our feet. A horrible suspicion came over us that he meant to come, too. But a
                    final whistle sounded. M. RenÃ© rose to his feet, and, crushing my fingers, bent
                    over me as he whispered tenderly, soothingly, reassuringly the words:â</p>
                <p>âL'avenir est aux audacieux.... Je viendrai!â</p>
                <p>Needless to say, my Parisian admirer has not yet braved the terrors of the
                    Channel<pb n="157" xml:id="VAB7114-143"/> passage for my sake. Now and again
                    he sends a âFigaroâ or a âGauloisâ containing a fervid article about his
                    pictures, for M. RenÃ©, it would seem, is on the way to fame; and once or twice
                    he has written to say that he intends to come and make serious studies of
                    <foreign xml:lang="fre">ces Ã©tonnants brouillards de Londres</foreign>. But
                    he never comes, nor does he, I shrewdly suspect, intend to. Paris has swallowed
                    him up.</p>

                <head>CHAPTER XII</head>
                <p><hi>DUNCAN CLIVE'S</hi> Hamlet had taken the town. Christina roundly declared it
                    was a revolting exhibition; but I don't know good acting from bad, so this last
                    reading of the great part was good enough for me. True, it was a smug,
                    sentimental, South Kensingtonian Hamlet, but I, in common with the rest of the
                    public, became enthusiastic over Mr. Duncan Clive. We are only human, and my
                    ardour was possibly not unconnected with the fact that the manager of the
                    Proscenium Theatre was the fashion. Fashions in art are eminently
                    contagious.</p>
                <p>He had the look of a Roman emperor. His large round head, his square,
                    clean-shaven jaw, and his broad shoulders made him an effective stage figure,
                    though in private life he often enough looked depressed and bilious, and
                    affected a humble and slightly apologetic manner. If you can picture Nero or
                    Caligula, in a sublime<pb n="159" xml:id="VAB7114-145"/> frock-coat, sitting
                    down meekly over the teacups and talking of âelevating the dramaâ and âimproving
                    the public taste,â you have a vision of Mr. Duncan Clive as he used to appear in
                    our drawing-room. He was an actor-manager, so he had to talk about improving the
                    public tasteâand yet keep one eye on the box office. He spent fabulous sums on
                    the production of his pieces, and all the town would flock to see his real
                    Empire furniture and his genuine Aubusson carpets.</p>
                <p>âWhether he is a great actor or not,â I argued one day with Christina, âat any
                    rate you must admit that he has done a great deal for the stage.â</p>
                <p>âMy dear, you mean for the stage-carpenter,â replied my sister, in an
                    aggravatingly conclusive tone of voice.</p>
                <p>Ours was the sort of house to which everybody goes. From ambassadors to
                    interviewers, there was hardly anybody we didn't know, and Christina and I were
                    told to be civil to all and sundry, but there was no need to admonish me to be
                    civil to the new Hamlet.</p>
                <p>I was in the studio, squeezing out colours on to father's palette, one day when
                    Mr. Duncan<pb n="160" xml:id="VAB7114-146"/> Clive was announced. There he stood
                    in the flesh, my favourite stage-lover, looking very blue about the jaw and very
                    dazzling about the necktie, and he waited a second or two, holding back the
                    heavy portiÃ¨re, just as he always did when he wished to make an effective
                    entrance on the stage. Then he stepped forward rapidly, with a brilliant smile,
                    shaking hands with father and making me a low and deferential bow.</p>
                <p>Father was to paint him as Hamlet for the next Academy, and he had chosen to be
                    done, not with Yorick's skull or in the famous soliloquy, but in the scene with
                    Guildenstern, where he snaps the pipe in two. âDo you think I am easier to be
                    played on than a pipe?â was the line to be depicted; and to be sure, Duncan
                    Clive made an imposing figure enough in his sombre doublet, standing with his
                    chin a little forward, and his eyes turned suspiciously towards the spectator.
                    It was characteristic of the man to have chosen that particular episode, that
                    especial pose, for he was above all things undecided and distrustful. He wanted
                    to be âin the movement,â but he wished to be well with the British public. He
                    would like to have<pb n="161" xml:id="VAB7114-147"/> mounted <title>Hedda
                        Gabler</title>, had there been a part big enough for him to play; he was
                    capable of producing Maeterlinck, but for his doubts about filling the stalls.
                    To see him humbly asking the opinion of the critics at one of his âfirst nightâ
                    suppers on the stage of the Proscenium Theatre was a curious and instructive
                    spectacle.</p>
                <p>He asked everybody's adviceâthat was one of his chief attractions in the eyes of
                    womenâand he even asked mine.</p>
                <p>Mr. Duncan Clive had beautiful, suggestive hands, which he used a good deal when
                    he talked, and a wandering, shifty eye, which travelled all round the room even
                    when he bent towards you in one of his many confidences. He had interminable
                    confidences to make. He liked to talk about his early life; only, as his
                    imagination was vivid, and his memory defective, his early life was apt to be
                    coloured by the mood of the moment. On dreary, dark November days, when the
                    trees outside seemed to ooze grime and soot, he would tell you, in thrilling
                    tones, that he began life barefoot, selling newspapers in the streets or calling
                    cabs at the theatre doors;<pb n="162" xml:id="VAB7114-148"/> and how, one
                    gruesome night, when he was shivering in the slush, he had made a vow that he
                    would produce Shakspearian plays at a London theatre before he was thirty years
                    of age. Other days, when the sun shone and the wind rioted out of doors, he
                    would recall a rose-shaded drawing-room window giving on a blue sea, and a
                    gentle-voiced mother who read Browning to him as he sat on soft cushions at her
                    feet... No, certainly the accounts of Mr. Duncan Clive's early training did not,
                    as his stage-carpenter would have expressed it, âjoinâ; but I am firmly
                    convinced that, while he was talking to you, while his deep-set, hungry grey
                    eyes sought inspiration now in yours, and now in the fairyland inside the fire,
                    he believed for the moment what he was saying. Most women liked to listen to
                    Duncan Clive's confidences, especially as Mrs. Duncan Clive did not usually
                    accompany him when he paid afternoon calls. He had married the âwalking ladyâ of
                    a travelling company some years ago, but this fact by no means interfered with
                    his success with the sex. Who cares whether Orlando, Charles Surface, or young
                    Mirabel has a wife in Bayswater or a troop of brats in<pb n="163" xml:id="VAB7114-149"/> Bedford Park? Not even the most romantic schoolgirl
                    cares. Young Mirabel carries the glamour of the footlights with him wherever he
                    goes.</p>
                <p>But this glamour, to be sure, rather interferes with the due enjoyment of one's
                    idol, who is apt to be surrounded by admiring devotees. Does Orlandoâin white
                    gardenia and patent-leather bootsâbut offer you his arm to go down to supper,
                    and you are pursued by a crowd of admiring ladies who hope to snatch him from
                    you. You are permitted to have neither your cavalier nor your supper. You gaze
                    wistfully at the salads and aspics, while an elderly lady buttonholes Orlando,
                    reminding him archly that they met, six years ago, in a railway carriage in
                    Switzerland, and proceeds on the strength of this acquaintanceship to introduce
                    to him her three nieces from Huddersfield, who are so devoted to dear Mr.
                    Clive's acting. Lady Susan takes him by the arm into a distant corner, from
                    whence he is presently dug out by the Duchess of Birmingham, who is âjust dying
                    to present himâ to Miss Van Hoyt. The successful actor-manager is always
                    engulfed in a sea of petticoats.</p>
                <pb n="164" xml:id="VAB7114-150"/>
                <p>But all this I could have borne if it had not been for Lalage Leigh. She was the
                    last straw. I could have forgiven him his wifeâshe didn't seem to countâand I
                    could have forgiven him Miss Montmorency, the leading lady, for I suspected him
                    of being jealous of her success with the dress-circle; but for Miss Lalage
                    Leigh, who played the pert chambermaids in comedy, and who undertook the
                    âsinging fairiesâ in Shakspearian productions, for her I had no toleration.</p>
                <p>We had just had a card for a supper party on the stage of the Proscenium Theatre,
                    and the matter was being discussed.</p>
                <p>âIn my young days,â said mother doubtfully, âgirls wouldn't have been taken to
                    supper parties behind the scenes.â</p>
                <p>âThey're tremendously good fun,â said Lady Susan, who was paying one of her
                    seven-minutes' visits; âand quite good form, you know, and all that sort of
                    thing. Lady Rougemont never misses one of Duncan's parties, and, what's more,
                    she brings her daughter. So do Mrs. Stanley Goring, and most of that lot. You
                    won't meet any actresses there, my dear lady, I can tell you.â</p>
                <pb n="165" xml:id="VAB7114-151"/>
                <p>âWe might as well go to a crush in Mayfair, then,â said Christina.</p>
                <p>âOh, it's not as bad as all that,â replied Lady Susan. âWhat I meant to say was,
                    that Miss Leigh is the only actress who ever appears at Duncan's suppers, and
                    she is perfectly good form, you know. Her father was a dean.â</p>
                <p>âThey always are,â said Christina; but Lady Susan pretended not to hear.</p>
                <p>At half-past eleven on the night in question we drove up to the Proscenium just
                    as the audience was streaming out. It was the hundredth night of a piece in
                    three acts, called <title>Hypocrisy</title>, which had drawn the town for some
                    three months. Going down the soft-carpeted staircase, lighted by pink-shaded
                    lamps, and lined with mirrors and laurel wreaths culled by Duncan Clive on his
                    last American tour, we passed the entrance to the stalls, the open door
                    revealing a now empty house with rows of pale pink-and-white chairs, and then,
                    mounting a step or two, turned sharply to the right, where a narrow door gave on
                    to the âwings.â The stage was âsetâ with the last act of
                    <title>Hypocrisy</title>, a scene which depicted the precincts of the
                    âCamellia Club,â<pb n="166" xml:id="VAB7114-152"/> in which a masked ball is
                    supposed to take place. Duncan Clive had not had time to change his dress, and
                    he now stood at the door, with brown grease-paint on his cheek and blue pencil
                    lines round his eyes, smiling and welcoming his guests.</p>
                <p>One or two modish women, notorious for their Bohemian tastes, had brought their
                    young daughters, who, surprised, delighted, and a little bit frightened at the
                    novel scene in which they found themselves, whispered together in corners, all
                    a-flutter with excitement and curiosity. The critics, imperturbable as usual,
                    preserved a mask-like expression of countenance while they listened to the
                    confidences of one or two leading actors on the vexed subject of their parts;
                    and a phalanx of men about town, a trifle bald about the temples, a little weary
                    about the eyes, gradually gathered on the stage. All these exquisitely-dressed
                    individuals addressed the actor-manager as âDuncan,â pressed the hand, while
                    they whispered a compliment into the ear, of Miss Lalage Leigh, and then
                    distributed themselves among the society dames who graced the scene with their
                    presence. Meanwhile, the heat was<pb n="167" xml:id="VAB7114-153"/> stifling,
                    and the footlights below, with the electric lights in the âflies,â cast an
                    unbecoming radiance on many a dyed head and wrinkled visage. In the distance a
                    middle-aged and faded woman, covered in diamonds, had engaged Mr. Clive in close
                    confabulation.</p>
                <p>âThat's Mrs. Stanley Goring. Good family, rich, nice husband, but goes in for the
                    stage, don't you know,â whispered Lady Susan; âshe's never happy unless she's
                    got Duncan to lunch or supper.â</p>
                <p>A buffet had been hastily erected by a dozen men in theatrical livery, and here
                    Cabinet Ministers, fashionable doctors, blond Jews, white-headed generals,
                    eminent tragedians, and the âpressâ scrambled for champagne bottles, sandwiches,
                    and cigars. A stout, red-faced man, who looked like a navvy in evening dress,
                    was surrounded by a little court, all anxious to hear what he said. âThat is
                    Brown, the Stock Exchange speculator,â continued Lady Susan; âhe makes âcornersâ
                    in things, and people want to know which way the wind's going'to blow. I'm just
                    going to make love to him myself; I want a straight tip about Lake Shores.
                    There's Percy Whitemore, the young man from the<pb n="168" xml:id="VAB7114-154"/> Thalia. Never mention the stage if you talk to him, my dear. Always discuss
                    horses; he likes to be taken for a cavalry man.â</p>
                <p>Meanwhile Mrs. Duncan Clive, in a drab silk gown, hovered vaguely, with an
                    apologetic smile, in the background, and a gallant old general, who was devoted
                    to the stage, surprised her very much by detaining her in conversation. Miss
                    Montmorency, who, it was supposed, had not only a âpastâ but a âpresent,â had
                    swept out, smothered in a fur pelisse and point lace, directly the play was
                    over. As Lady Susan had predicted, Miss Lalage Leigh was the only actress
                    there.</p>
                <p>For the daughter of an eminent ecclesiastic, I must say that Miss Leigh displayed
                    a considerable knowledge of the ways of an effete and over-civilised world. She
                    was a very pretty womanâeven with that flaunting dab of rouge on each cheek and
                    those deep-blue smudges round her eyes; even with that fixed, conventional smile
                    and that languorous professional glance. Already a little circle of men
                    surrounded her, so that it was almost impossible to approach, but it was to Mr.
                    Brown, the Stock Exchange magnate, that she seemed to<pb n="169" xml:id="VAB7114-155"/> have most to say. One heard her enquiring feverishly
                    about âBrighton A's,â and expressing doubts about the future of Grand Trunks.
                    She wished to be well, too, with Mrs. Stanley Goring, and detained that lady's
                    hand in her own while she shot several killing glances over her shoulder at the
                    critic of âThe Daily Telephone.â Mr. Duncan Clive had pressed my hand and
                    murmured something pretty when I arrived, but he had not yet found time to come
                    and speak to me.</p>
                <p>âI do think this sort of thing is over-rated, don't you?â I whispered to
                    Christina. They were bringing on a fresh supply of champagne now, and the men
                    were beginning to smoke and tell stories; the smart women were slipping out with
                    their young daughters through the flapping canvas doors. Father thought it was
                    time to go, and so did I.</p>
                <p>Picking up our skirts, we stepped cautiously along the dusty world behind the
                    scenes, threading our way through virgin forests, dungeon walls, and flowering
                    June meadows to the stage door. It was pitch dark, but we could see outside
                    stood a neat brougham and a man's back.</p>
                <p>The back, as we emerged into the street,<pb n="170" xml:id="VAB7114-156"/> turned
                    out to be that of Mr. Duncan Clive. With the grease-paint still on his lips, my
                    idol was imprinting a farewell salute on the bismuth-whitened arm of Miss Lalage
                    Leigh, who laughed as she slammed the carriage-door.</p>
                <p>It was an evidently not unrehearsed stage idyl.</p>

                <head>CHAPTER XIII</head>
                <p>â<hi>CHRISTINA</hi>,â I said thoughtfully one day when we were alone, âyou are a
                    young woman of sense and observation. Did it not occur to you, when Mr. John
                    Ford dined here last night, that he had the <foreign xml:lang="fre">cachet</foreign>, the unmistakable appearance of a
                    <emph>husband</emph>?â</p>
                <p>âWhat do you mean, Peggy? What ridiculous notions you always have. Why, everybody
                    knows that John Ford is not, and has never been, married.â</p>
                <p>âOh, that's nothing,â I retorted; âI tell you he was born to be henpecked, and to
                    have a carriage with fat horses, and never drive in it, and to pay long,
                    expensive milliners' bills. The man looks like a husband. Some men don't, and
                    never will; let them marry three times, and they never look as he looks.â</p>
                <p>âWell, he hasn't shown any indecent haste about taking a wife,â said Christina.
                    âHe must be every day of fifty.â</p>
                <pb n="172" xml:id="VAB7114-158"/>
                <p>âNo,â I said, meditatively, âhe is forty-sixâ <foreign xml:lang="fre">mettons</foreign> forty-six. He likes French cooking and Italian operas
                    (dear old fossils like the <title>Trovatore</title> and the
                    <title>Traviata</title>), he is slightly rotund, he will give his wife a
                    great many diamonds, and he will probably want to live in Prince's Gate. Now, if
                    I were to marry a stockbroker, I would never wear diamonds. It is so like the
                    City to wear diamonds. As a mere matter of taste, I should have nothing but
                    sapphires and pearls.... And I should draw the line at Prince's Gate.â</p>
                <p>âAs you have only seen the man twice in your whole existence, I don't think you
                    need disturb yourself about the locality you will inhabit with himâjust
                    yet.â</p>
                <p>âChristina, don't interrupt my day-dream. As a matter of fact, I should insist on
                    Mayfair. Not Charles Street, it's too gloomy; nor South Audley Street, it's too
                    noisy; but, say, Park Street, or one of those cosy little cross streetsâa red
                    house with a white door and copper fixings.â</p>
                <p>âBrass would be more appropriate for you, my dear girl,â said Christina,
                    sententiously; and then the thing slipped from my memory, as the<pb n="173" xml:id="VAB7114-159"/>
                    <pb n="175" xml:id="VAB7114-160"/> butler brought up a bunch of orchids from Mr.
                    Van Schuyler and a letter containing an invitation to dinner with Mr. Julian
                    Clancy.</p>
                <p>John Ford, the well-known stockbroker, had made his first appearance in our house
                    about a fortnight before. He had been brought to the studio by a pretty, showy
                    Jewess, who was a great admirer of father's, and who liked to run in and out at
                    all hours and bring whom she liked. He was tall, broad-shouldered, and
                    clean-shaven, and had bright blue eyes set in a square faceâa face which was red
                    all over. He was not quite ugly, but his manners were odd. He was very silent.
                    If he did speak, it was principally of âhuntin'â and âshootin'â; but when he
                    left the house he was the possessor of father's new Academy picture, for which
                    he had offeredâin an offhand way, in a distant cornerâthe sum of fifteen hundred
                    pounds.</p>
                <p>The next time we saw him it was at dinner, at one of our big dinners. It was one
                    of those nights when I am simple and natural, and my frock happened to be one of
                    those white, soft, fluffy things, which cost a small fortune and look so
                    inexpensive.</p>
                <pb n="176" xml:id="VAB7114-161"/>
                <p>At first the conversation did not flourish, but Mr. John Ford looked furtively
                    and approvingly out of the corner of his eye as he ate his soup. âNice little
                    frock,â he said at last. âLike to see little girls in white. Ought always to
                    dress in white.â And this was the first and last occasion on which Mr. John Ford
                    has ever paid me a compliment. Talking, as I have said, was somewhat hard work,
                    but before the dinner was over he had told me most of his tastes and
                    predilections. In a world where we change our idols every six months, it was
                    refreshing to find anyone with simple, old-fashioned tastesâa liking for
                    pictures with sunset skies and waxen-faced maidens, for love stories which end
                    happily, and for oleaginous Italian melodies. These were the things in fashion
                    in Mr. John Ford's heyday of youth, and they suggested a capacity for fidelity
                    which was encouraging. And such is the adaptability of woman and the egoism of
                    man that before we left the dinner-table Mr. Ford was convinced that I cared for
                    these things also. But it was not of Academy pictures and three-volume novels
                    that I wished to talk with Mr. John Ford. âContangos,â âdebentures,â âbears,â
                    and<pb n="177" xml:id="VAB7114-162"/> âbullsâ have always been words of
                    strange fascination for me, probably because I am totally ignorant of everything
                    that goes on in the City. It came over me like madness that I wanted to have a
                    little gamble, and Mr. John Ford offered to give me a âstraight tip,â as he
                    called it, about Patagonians. And I, who never possessed more than 1<choice>

                    reckless as we discussed the âlittle flutterâ which I was to undertake. There is
                    hardly anything so infectious as the disease of gambling.</p>
                <p>For the rest of the evening Mr. John Ford did not come near me, but Christina
                    admitted afterwards that he was watching me all the time. And when he left I was
                    told that my financial affairs were to be seen to at once. How excited, how
                    dissipated I felt!</p>
                <p>During the next few days I received several business-looking blue envelopes, in
                    Mr. John Ford's handwriting, in which I was informed that Patagonians were
                    âdull,â and afterwards that there was a âboomâ in the same financial commodity,
                    and then again that a fall was expected soon, to be followed by a riseâall of<pb n="178" xml:id="VAB7114-163"/> which was Greek to me, but which sounded very
                    reckless.</p>
                <p>But one day, a week later, I had a shock which will always be a date in my
                    history. Christina and I were sitting alone over the tea-cups. A blue
                    business-looking envelope was once more served up on a silver tray. I began to
                    feel like a Rothschild or a Baring.</p>
                <p>âWhat's this?â I muttered, as I began to seize the purport of the few
                    neatly-written lines which meandered over a large page. âHe's bought me five

                    got a penny in the world! I was only jokingââ</p>
                <p>âAn odd sort of joke, my dear child,â said Christina drily. âCouldn't you have
                    remembered that rather important fact before?â</p>
                <p>âOh, I can't pay it! What's to be done? Father must be told, andâandâI shall
                    never dare to look him in the face again!â</p>
                <p>âWhoâfather?â</p>
                <p>âNâno. Mr. Ford. And I like him so much, with his little blue eyes, and his face
                    which is red all over.â</p>

                </choice> said Christina, with what I thought then was a devilish calm, as she
                    produced some telegraph-forms, pushed the ink and pen towards me, and rang the
                    bell for the man.</p>
                <p>In less than an hour John Ford was ushered into the room. Regardless of
                    appearances, I had had a thoroughly feminine âcry,â and was now huddled up on
                    the sofa, with reddened eyelids and roughened hairâa dismal-looking hostess to
                    receive afternoon callers. He came in, shut the door, and sat down, gazing at me
                    in astonished silence.</p>
                <p>âWhat's the matter, Miss Wynman?â he said at last. âBeen sending some poor devil
                    about his business, and regretted it already, eh?â</p>
                <p>âNo, no, I never send anybody about their businessâIâIâhate business any way.
                    And, oh! why did you buy all those shares?â</p>

                <p>John Ford laughed. âWell, I think I can manage to get rid of 'em for you. In
                    fact, I know a chap who wants five more.â</p>
                <p>To anyone not blinded by financial terrors the little subterfuge must have been
                    palpable. As it was, I never saw it till long afterwards.</p>
                <p>âDo you really know of someone who wants them? I think you are an angel!â I said
                    fervently.</p>
                <p>John Ford blushed redder than ever, and just for a minute there was an
                    embarrassing silence. We did not mention Patagonians again, and yet he stayed
                    quite a long time that afternoon. At parting we looked straight at each other,
                    and I knew from that minute forward we should be firm allies. There has never
                    been a moment's doubt, from that day, that we should get on.</p>
                <milestone unit="section" n="....."/>
                <p>Six months have gone by since that day, and lots of things have happened.
                    Everyone in the house is very nice to me just now. Father calls me every minute
                    into the studio to ask my advice. Motherâdear mother!âlooks at me solicitously,
                    and follows me about the house with a biscuit and a glass of port wine.<pb n="181" xml:id="VAB7114-166"/> Christina slips out of the room when the
                    doorbell rings. Nobody contradicts me. It reminds me of once, long ago, when I
                    was ill.</p>
                <p>And to be sure I am tired, very tired. Such quantities of gushing notes arrive by
                    every post, which all require an enthusiastic answer, and large brown-paper
                    parcels, with many wrappings, which have to be undone. I might be qualifying for
                    the treadmill, I have tramped so often up the bare staircases of empty houses,
                    where elderly ladies, smelling of gin-and-water, implore me to convince myself
                    how excellent are the dustbins, and what convenient linen-cupboards there are
                    next to the garrets. I bring home racking headaches from emporiums in the
                    Tottenham Court Road, whence I emerge having ordered Louis XVI. clocks for all
                    the servants' bedrooms, and the particular shade of blue which I detest for the
                    dining-room chairs. Other days, it is true, I slink out of the shop with the
                    excuse that the drawing-room carpet which I have been choosing for the last two
                    hours is for a friend, and that nothing can be decided without consulting her;
                    but this transparent fabrication is invariably received with looks of withering
                    scorn by the shopman<pb n="182" xml:id="VAB7114-167"/> in attendance. I am
                    getting accustomed to this, if not to the ineffable Young Person in black silk
                    who presides at Mme Virginie's, and who always leaves me, after one of our
                    lengthened and heating interviews, with the pleasing impression that I am
                    undersized, hopelessly plain, and dressed in shocking taste. Her piercing black
                    eyes look me through; they discover the weak points in the cut of my nethermost
                    petticoat, and I dare swear, if the truth be told, that she is perfectly aware
                    that I have a small hole in the heel of my stocking.</p>
                <p>But the process of gentle, low-voiced bullying which goes on at the milliner's
                    only leaves one more obstinate, and I think I prefer my sworn enemy the
                    ineffable Young Person to that other imperious Hebe at the hat-shop, who looks
                    aggravatingly pretty in every shape, however eccentric, and who is of opinion
                    that âMadam cannot do betterâ than take a straw saucer trimmed with stuffed
                    birds and strawberries, seeing that Mrs. Langtry has definitely made it the
                    mode. There are those nervous interviews, too, with grinning, sporting-looking
                    attorneys in Lincoln's Inn Fields, when perfectly incomprehensible documents
                    without stops are read out<pb n="183" xml:id="VAB7114-168"/> to me, and I
                    finally put my signature on a parchment, which makes one feel for all the world
                    as if one were signing a death-warrant. There are the relations, too, unknown
                    aunts and cousins from the provinces and the suburbs, who suddenly appear,
                    asking one disagreeable questions about one's age, and who generally sigh, and
                    âhope it will all be for the best.â Then there is the advice, the reams of good
                    advice, which they and my other friends shower upon me.</p>
                <p>I am assuredâwhat I can well believeâthat it is the first year which is so
                    trying. Some would have me change the savouries at dinner constantly, others
                    insist that I must begin with morning prayers, while another division conjure me
                    not to allow smoking in the dining-room. I am implored not to object to clubs,
                    am warned about pretty parlour-maids, am told not to be too credulous, and am
                    supplicated not to show signs of jealousy, as being quite out of date. A few
                    pray me to be tolerant of old friends, race-meetings, and cigarettes; while many
                    more urge me to keep an observant eye on sisters-inlaw, cheque-books, and bills.
                    There is all this, and, as a final blow, there is the mackerel-kettle!</p>
                <pb n="184" xml:id="VAB7114-169"/>
                <p>I think, on the whole, the mackerel-kettle has given me more weary days and
                    sleepless nights than any other article I have had to procure. In every book on
                    Furnishing we find the mackerel-kettle placed foremost in the list of
                    indispensable things; in no illustrated catalogue of ironmongery is a tempting
                    little wood-cut of a mackerel-kettle omitted; and yet in the flesh, or rather in
                    the metal, the mackerel-kettle for ever eludes us. Fabulous sums are expended in
                    hansom cabs, scouring the Tottenham Court Road in pursuit of this phantom
                    article of hardware, and I begin to think that my chances of happiness may be
                    seriously compromised...</p>
                <p>But time flies by. The day is very near, now. One foggy winter afternoon I toil
                    upstairs to Christina's room, dragging after me, with the help of the maid, a
                    long, brown, wooden box.</p>
                <p>âWhat do you think has come?â I demand breathlessly, bursting into the room where
                    Christina is trying to read an article on the âUnder-payment of Feminine Labourâ
                    in one of the reviews. âPut it down, Sarah. Unbuckle the strap, quick!â</p>
                <p>Womanlike, my sister throws down the<pb n="185" xml:id="VAB7114-170"/> âTwentieth
                    Century,â and we bend curiously over the box as the maid lifts gingerly out a
                    garment of shimmering white and silver from under a layer of tulle.</p>
                <p>Symbols of the Eternal Feminine, those lengths of glittering satin flaunt
                    themselves over the sofa and along the floor, lighting up the dim little room
                    with their sumptuous whiteness, while, like a June cloud, the foam of tulle
                    floats for an instant in the winter dusk.</p>
                <p>It is my wedding gown.</p>
