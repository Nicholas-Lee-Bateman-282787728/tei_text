            <head>The Indiana Physician as Geologist and Naturalist</head>
            <byline>William DePrex Inlow<hi rend="sup">∗</hi>
            </byline>
            <p>In the development of natural science in Indiana during the nineteenth century the doctor of medicine
                    played an important role. His contribution is not to be marveled at, for it was he above all others
                    who by temperament and training was led to the study of nature. It was to be expected that his
                    primary concern with the science of man himself should also find expression in the exploration of
                    other fields. The physician became a botanist almost of necessity, for he had need of medicinal
                    plants. He roved forest and field in collecting; he treasured his herbarium; animal life intrigued
                    him. He often made notations and reports concerning both the flora and the fauna of his area.
                    Scientific interest thus always goes beyond subservience to what is deemed immediately practical. In
                    the streams where the physician studied fish and searched for shells he found rocks exposed, some of
                    which bore in them the remains of the life of eons past. He became a collector of fossils. The
                    pursuit of paleontology led him into the intricacies of stratigraphy. When interest in geological
                    knowledge developed, it was frequently to the physician that public authorities turned for
                    assistance in geological survey.</p>
            <p>Today the physician is no longer natural historian having a wide knowledge of the abundant life forms
                    of his state, no longer paleontologist classifying specimens for his cabinet, no longer field
                    geologist conducting surveys of his own and other counties. Science in days past was not so
                    comprehensive, so detailed as now. One then could be an all-round man, <list type="footnotes">

                    feat has become well-nigh impossible. The present-day physician, busy with his own estate, seldom
                    pauses long enough even to visit the lands of his neighbor. Intensification of effort confined to an
                    ever smaller domain has brought much profit, but in the process of specialization something has been
                    lost—something intangible and difficult to name. It has been customary to look down on
                    the early medical man as a person of meagre intellectual attainment. In this judgment we should not
                    be too hasty. It is the purpose of this presentation to call attention to some of the
                    physician's contributions in fields not ordinarily considered his province. After briefly
                    tracing the general story of natural history and geology in the state, this article will portray the
                    part taken in this development by certain medical men whose contributions were outstanding.</p>

                    Rappists or Harmonists, in 1815. In 1824 Robert Owen, the famous Scottish philanthropist and
                    socialist, purchased the property for a utopian experiment which eventually failed. Many talented
                    men and women were led to seek this singular place. Here, it was affirmed, science and letters would
                    rise like the orient sun to enlighten the benighted western world. Thus by attracting learned
                    persons from abroad and from the East, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> became and remained for a number of years an important scientific and literary center
                    in Indiana.</p>
            <p>The first person to study natural life in Indiana was apparently the eccentric Constantine Samuel
                    Rafinesque, though the ornithologist, John James Audubon, in the years immediately after 1808
                    doubtless made trips north of the <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> to add Indiana birds to his collection. Rafinesque came to the <placeName>

                    </placeName> for the second time in 1815; wanderlust led him west. Securing the professorship of

                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, he set out down the <placeName>

                    before been catalogued. Unknown species were on every hand, and "like <pb n="3" id="VAA4025-056-1-013"/> a schoolboy, Rafinesque searched and found, studied, described, drew,

                    </placeName> in the mid-twenties, besides the Owens themselves, was Thomas Say. Say has been named
                    the Father of American Entomology, the Father of American Conchology, and even the Father of

                    </placeName>, David Dale Owen was destined to be "the first, the most learned and the most

                    assembly passed an act authorizing and requiring the governor "to appoint and commission a

                    Indiana…." The salary was $1,500 with $250 for expenses.
                    The geologist was to make a complete and minute geological survey of the state and "at
                    those seasons not suited to the active prosecution of the geological survey, to analyze and
                    ascertain the qualities and properties of mineral substances or soils left at his office or

                    physiology to help him understand paleontology. Until 1835 he had been primarily interested in
                    chemistry, but in October of that year he embarked upon the study of medicine, registering at the

            <p>The year 1837 wm a most auspicious one for David Dale Owen. He became a doctor of medicine, he became

                    back at work in his laboratory, a place which became his headquarters for his geological surveys. In
                    1837 Indiana was in the throes of its internal improvement program; otherwise the initiation of
                    state geological work might have been delayed many years. The appropriation allowed Owen for his
                    investigations seems very niggard today, but at least it was a start—perhaps the first
                    sum ever granted by an Indiana legislature for scientific purposes.</p>
            <p>During the spring and summer of 1837, Owen studied the succession of formations in southern Indiana
                    which were exposed on the bluffs along the banks of the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>, drawing a

                    determine the limits of the various formations which he had identified. He determined fairly
                    accurately the eastern boundary of the coal measures, showing that it would be " a useless

                            The geologist and his assistants often used a carriage for their own transportation while

                    century when it had dawned on James Hutton that the earth carried its own self-story. Cuvier had
                    only founded paleontology in 1812, William Smith stratigraphy in 1815. Furthermore, it had been only
                    seven years before Owen's first report, namely in 1830, that Charles Lyell had applied the

                    reason. Concerning the genesis of the stratified rocks of Indiana he wrote cautiously: "The

            <p>It is remarkable that Owen's successors were able to carry out as much of this program as
                    they ultimately did, considering the limited funds placed at their disposal. In 1839 the legislature
                    passed an act providing for "an examination and report of the mineral resources of the

                    individual initiative was not.</p>
            <p>In 1837 when David Dale Owen started his career in Indiana as a professional geologist, Dr. Asahel
                    Clapp of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> was forty-five years old and at the height of his career as physician and scientist.
                    Two years earlier he had already begun to collect plant specimens from the Knobs region of southern
                    Indiana for his herbarium, a collection of sufficient importance to command the attention four
                    decades later of that prince of Indiana botanists, John Merle Coulter.<hi rend="sup">19</hi> A
                    number of Clapp's angiosperm specimens dated 1838-1839 may still be seen in the Stanley

            </p>
            <p>During Clapp's time the science of botany was young, and the botanist was chiefly a
                    taxonomist or collector. Collecting and classifying was a necessary preliminary role before the
                    botanist could become a morphologist studying the ontogeny of plants, or an ecologist. That is to
                    say, the first task confronting those engaged in botanical study was that of ordering plant forms
                    into system according to their natural relationships; only then were botanists prepared to proceed
                    to the study of the life histories of individual organisms themselves and to the investigation of
                    the mutual relations existing between organisms and their environment. This classificatory or
                    taxonomic phase was to persist for sixty-five years or so after the founding of the state, and Clapp
                    was among those who contributed to the work that was done. Collecting specimens in Clapp's

                    at St. Albans, a town about twenty-five miles west of his home; he was not a graduate of a medical

                    when only seventeen years of age. Shortly thereafter, he wedded Elizabeth, widow of Nathaniel
                    Scribner. Within the brief period of three years, Clapp became one of the most successful and
                    influential practitioners in the state. He has left a diary which gives much insight into medical

            <p>Among Indiana physician-naturalists Asahel Clapp is outstanding on two accounts. He achieved
                    recognition not only as a scientist, but also as a leader in his profession. When the original state
                    medical society was formed in 1820, Clapp was its first president.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> For reasons
                    which are not entirely clear, the society lapsed after a half-dozen years of existence, but
                    following the establishment of the present Indiana State Medical Society in 1849, Clapp became its
                    second president.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>

                    periodicals doubtless explains why Plummer is an individual largely unknown in the annals of Hoosier
                    medicine. Nonetheless, John T. Plummer is the most important all-round scientist-physician of early
                    Indiana. He is almost as interesting a personality as Constantine Samuel Rafinesqu—not
                    quite so eccentric and not such a traveler, but just as industrious and as eager an inquirer.
                    Plummer in his writings made contributions to natural history, horticulture, geology, meteorology,
                    chemistry, botany, and other fields.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> The bibliography of his works includes
                    approximately 152 titles ranging all the way from pharmacy to philology.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>

                            careless of knowledge and playful, but somehow learned; from ten to thirteen studied
                            diligently; from thirteen to sixteen cared not for knowledge but wanted to be good; from
                            sixteen to nineteen, when the memorandum was made, was avaricious for knowledge, and was

                    deserving of full-fledged biographical treatment as David Dale Owen.</p>
            <p>Although private scientific investigators such as Plummer continued their work, formal study of
                    Indiana's geology had been suspended with the termination of David Dale Owen's
                    survey in 1838. It was not until 1852 that Indiana was willing to take up again the question of
                    further geological survey in the state.<hi rend="sup">39</hi> This time it was Dr. Ryland T. Brown
                    who pushed the matter. Chafing under the delay, he delivered a lecture in the Hall of the House of
                    Representatives on the evening of January 22 on "The Geology of Indiana as an Element of
                    Wealth to the State." He maintained that not only should the geology and mineralogy of the
                    state as a whole be investigated, but also that the topography of each county should be studied as
                    well. Brown was authorized by the newly created State Board of Agriculture to act as its
                    "Geological Agent." His report entitled "Geological Survey of the State
                    of Indiana" appeared in the <hi rend="i">Third Annual Report of the … Board of

                    Brown, who was not only the leader in this field but also prominent in scientific work in general.
                    In the <hi rend="i">Ninth Report of the Indiana State Board of Agriculture</hi>, 1867, he published
                    "An Essay on the Mineral Resources of Indiana" and in 1868 issued a pamphlet at

                    who persuaded the state legislature in 1869 to pass the act authorizing a geological survey and
                    creating the permanent office of state geologist.<hi rend="sup">45</hi> This last service alone was
                    to prove of inestimable value both to the state in general and to Indiana geology in particular.</p>
            <p>Ryland T. Brown was one of the most versatile men ever to grace the state. Physician, geologist,
                    preacher, reformer, educator, his influence was widely felt. He was born in <placeName>

                    write of him: "For his liking for science he was an enigma to the ignorant, was ridiculed
                    by the foolish, and even wise men wondered how he could devote so much time and study to something
                    in which there was so little pecuniary profit."<hi rend="sup">53</hi> But Haymond had his

                        <p>I am myself well persuaded that the study of nature is calculated both to make us better and
                            happier—to draw our minds away from the difficulties which are incident to life,
                            from our own evil passions and the bickerings and strife of those among whom we
                            live—in short from the artificial to the natural…. All nature, both
                            animate and inanimate, is worthy of your study and investigation, for there is not a stone
                            or pebble upon which you tread in your daily walks which has not an interesting history
                            which the mineralogist and geologist know how to read; not a plant or flower but has a
                            secret history, known only to the botanist; each beast and bird, fish and insect has also
                            its history, read only by the zoologist, ornithologist, and so on. Much of this knowledge is
                            in reach of all of you who are young and have sufficient energy and industry to occupy that
                            portion of your time in study which ia usually wasted in idleness or thrown away in pursuits

            <p>The measure of a man's contribution to society is not determined solely by his individual
                    work, for assuredly in final assessment his influence in stimulating others to effort must also be
                    taken into account. And Haymond was the inspiration for that group of young men, who, led by Amos

                    influence on one another. Haymond was interested in natural science from the start; Cornett, on the
                    contrary, devoted his most active years to medical affairs. When the Indiana State Medical Society
                    was organized in 1849, Cornett became its first president, thus preceding Asahel Clapp in this
                    office. It was only after his retirement from practice and his removal to <placeName>

                    he was placed under a physician for three years as a preceptee in medicine. He developed a liking
                    for the profession and became a diligent student sufficiently concerned about his future to return
                    to Transylvania University for a full course of lectures during the winter of 1823-1824.<hi rend="sup">56</hi> The faculty of the medical department of this school was at the time the most

                        and Coulter were to become so. Collett had submitted to Cope for determination and study such
                        vertebrate remains as had been found in Indiana, and the latter, assisted by Wortman, was now
                        publishing his report. Edward D. Cope and Jacob L. Wortman, "An Account of the

            <p>In one respect Alembert W. Brayton is different from other Indiana physician-naturalists who have
                    been discussed thus far; his studies in science were well under way by the time he started his
                    medical career. This fact is significant in that it heralds the beginning of the change from
                    generalism to specialism. A generation or so later, the trend toward specialization was to dictate
                    that the young man in medicine had to become either medical scientist or medical practitioner, that
                    he could not successfully become both. Medical knowledge was rapidly expanding; medical education
                    had passed from the days of precepteeship to those of full attendance at medical school, and the
                    requirements of practice had become all demanding. Brayton's medical studies which had

                    chair of physiology, and then afterwards to the chair of pathology, clinical medicine, and

                    medical school circles, editor, and specialist consultant; Elrod, the village dweller, the detached
                    inquirer, the general practitioner sought after only by the sick of his own community. Moses N.
                    Elrod is a shining example of what was at times accomplished even by the isolated rural physician.
                    Elrod began by collecting fossils at Tarr Hole near his home at Hartsville in <placeName>

                    Niagaran fossils outcrops on Big Clifty just as it does at the better-known site at the confluence
                    of Deer Creek with Conn's Creek in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Shelby County</region>
                    </placeName>. When John Collett wanted an assistant to make the survey of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Bartholomew County</region>
                    </placeName> in 1881, Dr. Moses N. Elrod was chosen. In conjunction with E. S. McIntire, Elrod had
                    already made a survey of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Orange County</region>
                    </placeName> in 1875, so that he was not without experience. In the years that followed, this
                    physician conducted the geological surveys of <placeName>

               </placeName>, and
                    Union counties, all in his part of the state. Finally in 1891 he and A. C. Benedict surveyed <placeName>

                    </placeName>. It was Elrod who first recognized clearly in 1883 that there were two shales in the
                    Niagara formations: one near the top, the Waldron shale, and one at the base which he called the
                    Lower Niagara shale (<placeName>

                    subsequently studying medicine under Dr. John Sloan, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>

                    in the Twenty-fourth Indiana Volunteer Infantry Regiment and was assigned to duty as a hospital
                    steward. He was soon discharged, however, because of ill health. In the spring of 1862 he applied
                    for duty again, and this time was appointed acting assistant surgeon at Hospital No. 1, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where he remained until the close of the war. During this period he contracted an
                    infection which crippled his right leg so that he was forced to walk with crutch and cane the rest
                    of his life. Following his war service, Elrod was graduated from the <placeName>

                    return to Orleans. Here he served as postmaster for six years. During this time he studied law
                    independently and was finally admitted to the bar. He taught natural science at the Southern Indiana
                    Normal School at Paoli. In 1877 he removed to Hartsville where he practiced medicine actively until
                    1897, when he took up residence in <placeName>

            <p>That Moses N. Elrod had the true spirit of investigation is shown by the botanical studies which he
                    carried out in his own garden at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName> after his retirement. How rare such keen interest in nature that one without equipment,
                    using only such objects of study as were at hand and the simplest of means, should spend his last
                    summers still seeking to clarify some of the problems of nature. In the method he employed in these
                    last investigations, Elrod passed beyond what any of his physician-naturalist
                    compeers—with the sole exception of John Thomas Plummer—had done; he proceeded
                    from mere observation to experimentation. Even Brayton, forerunner of the new era in medicine though
                    he was, still remained a taxonomist, or classifier, like his predecessors. Working with trumpet
                    vines, Elrod noticed in July, 1902, that the stigma of <hi rend="i">Tecoma radicans</hi> was
                    sensitive. <list type="footnotes">

                    later found that he had been anticipated, for the phenomenon had already been reported in
                    Muller's <hi rend="i">Fertilization of Flowers.</hi> Nevertheless, Elrod proceeded with
                    experiments designed to test the sensitiveness of the stigmas and the conditions under which

            <p>Dr. Arthur John Phinney is a physician-naturalist who may be placed with Elrod in contradistinction
                    to Alembert W. Brayton with regard to involvement in public medical concerns. In many respects Elrod
                    and Phinney are similar since both had particular interest in geology. As Collett had chosen Elrod
                    to assist him in the project of surveying the individual counties of the state so did he select
                    Arthur J. Phinney. Though Phinney is known in scientific circles, he is not remembered in relation
                    to Indiana medicine. G. W. H. Kemper in his <hi rend="i">Medical History of the State of
                    Indiana</hi> does not even mention him, and gives him little notice in his <hi rend="i">History of <placeName>

                    </placeName>. A possible explanation of the fact that Phinney's name is not connected with
                    medicine is that he was a homeopath, a graduate of Pulte Medical College of <placeName>

                    </placeName> in 1877. Regular physicians gave scant recognition in those days to those whom they

                            gather specimens or to study birds and animals in their natural habitat. He made extensive
                            zoological and botanical collections. His zoological collections are now in the U. S.

                            made in the State. He was an authority on mammalia and he was one of the Collaborators on

            <p>People of today may find it difficult to comprehend how men of an earlier day got along without
                    modern drugs and medical technology. Yet early settlers in southern Indiana and elsewhere managed to
                    get by with the medicinal materials at hand and, perhaps, counted themselves fortunate if they had a
                    "doctor shop" within a few miles and a "doc" whom they could
                    reach without an appointment.</p>

                    Andrew P. Hay. Dr. Rodgers, however, died in 1833; whereas Dr. Hay was still practicing medicine as

                        Dr. Hay and Dr. John T. Purington had entered into a partnership on June 27, 1821, and dissolved
                        it on April 1, 1822. SO the partnership between Hay and Rodgers must have been somewhere between
                        1822 and 1827; it could not have been for more than five years at the most. Furthermore,
                        Rodgers' name was not included in a list of local physicians which was printed in 1823,

                    profession was considered well off."<hi rend="sup">7</hi>

            <p>The editor is aware that there is today rather wide acquaintance with several of the common items
                    included in the inventory, such as quinine, arsenic, digitalis, ether, and olive oil; therefore,
                    these are not identified in the explanatory notes. In discussing less well-known drugs, the editor
                    has attempted to make some comparisons between their recent usage and that of pioneer times. And now
                    a few words of caution: a mere discussion of early drugs does not in any way constitute a
                    recommendation for their application today. It is well to remember that the pioneers had to bear the
                    brunt of much experimentation.</p>

                        in this note, the inventory of Dr. Rodgers' possessions has been exactly reproduced.
                        Original spelling, capitalization, and punctuation have been carefully followed. The
                        considerable number of errors and inconsistencies in spelling throughout the inventory would
                        have called for overuse of "<hi rend="i">sic</hi>," therefore, that device has
                        been utilized only in a few special instances. The arabic numerals that divide the inventory
                        into sections mark each new page in the original document. In reproducing the inventory,
                        flourishes of the pen and indiscriminate dashes and dots have been omitted. Penciled notations
                        indicating which items in the inventory were subsequently sold have also been ignored. In order
                        to clarify all items mentioned in the inventory, the editor went first to contemporary sources
                        for an explanation; if these references did not shed any light upon the item—and this
                        was often the case—he then searched modern medical literature. In most instances,
                        some hint about the usage of a drug or compound was found; however, variations in suggested
                        dosage can distort one's impression about how and for what the drug was used. It was
                        necessary, therefore, to mention a general range of maladies for which a particular drug was
                        employed. With respect to medical books, the procedure was to trace briefly the European
                        editions and to comment on the more important American editions. The footnotes indicate that it
                        is virtually impossible to track down all editions and printings of some of these works.
                        Although the editor received much help, he assumes full responsibility for all errors.</item>

                        doctors, in addition to using it against malaria and other fevers, may have made a tincture out

                        it by its offensive and repulsive odor. Yet today a small amount used as a condiment gives
                        distinctive aroma to Worcestershire sauce. Asafetida was formerly used for nervous exhaustion
                        and hysteria, but the effect was more psychological than therapeutic. It has been added to
                        laxative drugs, used as a carminative for colic, and employed as an expectorant. Its
                        disagreeable taste makes asafetida in the pill form a little easier to take than in other forms,

                        acts as an aromatic stimulant and has proven itself for the relief of intestinal gas, pains, and
                        nausea. Because of its agreeable flavor, peppermint (spirit, oil, and water) is an important
                        addition to other medicinal mixtures. Oil of peppermint was used by the pioneers as a home

                        an emmenagogue. Perhaps it was sabina (savin) in tincture form. See n. 83. Sabina has also
                        "been much used for the purpose of producing criminal abortion." Needless to
                        say, in such doses, it is extremely dangerous to the patient. The editor wants to point out here
                        that he is merely stating that a drug was available to the pioneer physician for both uses

            </byline>
            <p>This is a review of a book plus some comments on the art of water witching, dowsing, divining,
                    bletonizing, or "rod walking." The reviewer's qualifications for this
                    task are as follows: (1) he has read the book; (2) he is a "witch"—a
                    right powerful one. Further, he believes that he has some "contributions,"
                    suggestions, arguments, and questions, which, though they may not add mightily to the corpus of
                    scientific knowledge, at least may serve further to obfuscate the issue and add to the fun.</p>
            <p>The art of water witching is an ancient and venerable one, and the literature on the subject is
                        voluminous.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Folklorists, students of magic, novelists, and even scientists
                    have written hundreds of books and articles on the subject, yet "witching" remains
                    as much of a mystery today as it was when Georgius Agricola wrote his treatise in 1556.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The book under review is <hi rend="i">Water Witching U.S.A.</hi>, by Evon Z. Vogt and Ray Hyman (<placeName>

                    or whether they are "witches," but one concludes from internal evidence that they
                    are not. At any rate, they have produced an interesting and worth-while book which contains almost
                    all—but not quite—that any mentally astute, socially aware, and
                    self-respecting citizen need know about the subject.</p>
            <p>Water witching, like the question of the proper way to make a mint julep (or a martini), or whether

                    witching…" (p. 5). Though "geologists, water engineers, government
                    officials, and other scientists have opposed this unorthodoxy ever since it became popular some four
                    hundred years ago" (p. 3), it is only necessary to read extracts from the newspapers of our
                    day (several are cited in Chapter I) to realize that there are those equally educated, who hold that
                    these "geological eggheads" and other "ignorami" should have
                    some sense hammered into their heads. Most persons feel that they have to be either <hi rend="i">for</hi> water witching or <hi rend="i">against</hi> it; there seem to be few neutrals.</p>
            <p>The book is organized around six questions as follows: (1) "What is water
                    witching?"; (2) "Does it work?"; (3) "What makes the rod
                    move?"; (4) "Who is the witch?"; (5) "Under what conditions is
                    water witching practiced in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>?"; and (6) "Why does water witching continue to be practiced in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>?" After study of the literature on the subject, the authors devised a
                    questionnaire (reproduced in the appendix) which was sent to five hundred county agricultural
                    agents; they observed and interviewed diviners in different states and corresponded with diviners in
                    various countries. The basic data were sifted by TBM machines which tabulated the extent of water
                    witching and the conditions under which it is practiced.</p>
            <p>In Chapter II, "The Family Tree," the history of water witching is traced and the
                    techniques explained. Though some writers find evidence of the practice among ancient peoples, no
                    positive evidence of water witching occurs until the fifteenth century. Witching apparently
                    originated in the mining districts of what is now <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> (Luther issued a proclamation against the rod in 1518), then spread throughout Europe,
                    to Africa, and parts of Asia, the Americas, <placeName>
                        <country reg="at">Australia</country>
                    </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <country reg="nz">New Zealand</country>
                    </placeName>. The technique has not changed since Agricola's day. The practitioner takes a
                    forked branch of live wood (almost any kind) with a butt end; he grasps the ends of the branches
                    with his palms up, points the butt end up, springs (bends) the branches apart somewhat, and walks to
                    and fro to find the spot at which the butt end will describe an arc of 180 degrees and point at the
                    earth. A series of photo diagrams illustrates the technique. In Chapter II we are also introduced to
                    Kenneth Roberts and his high-powered diviner, Henry Gross, who was reputed by his <pb n="67" id="VAA4025-056-1-077"/> discoverer to be able to locate water, estimate its depth, etc., even
                    from a map.</p>
            <p>Chapters III and IV deal with "Does it work?"; that is, does the rod indicate
                    water. Case histories are recorded, controlled experiments described, and the data interpreted.
                    Result: case not proved. In one recorded experiment with seventy-five dowsers, not one did better
                    than chance in returning to an "underground stream" with his eyes closed or in
                    locating the same "underground water" that others had located. Here our argument
                    begins.</p>
            <p>Before proceeding further, let us make two things absolutely clear. (After all, the reviewer thinks
                    of himself as a more or less sane and law-abiding citizen and does not want to go too far out on a
                    limb—or even a switch!) First, though he has had some twenty-five years experience with
                    "witching" and has "discovered" some scores of
                    "witches," he has conducted no scientific experiments, recorded no mass data. He
                    has not "witched" the Sahara Desert, the Empire State Building, or Wall Street.
                    (That might be an idea!) He knows nothing about metal gadgets, mechanical divining rods, and
                    perpetual motion machines. Second, though he admits to being a "witch"
                    ("warlock" or "wizard" somehow do not seem to fit), he means
                    merely that he is one in whose hands the rod twists; twists with a measurable physical force, a
                    force strong enough not only to peel the bark off the rod and the skin off his hands, but, after a
                    certain number of passes, to twist the rod in two above the hands. This force can be measured by
                    holding a small spring scale in one's mouth and attaching a string to it and to the butt of
                    the rod; the force varies, of course, with the size of the rod and the "hotness"
                    of the spot which affects the rod. <hi rend="i">The reviewer does not have the slightest notion what
                        the movement of the rod indicates.</hi> It might indicate bubbles in the earth, extinct
                    volcanoes, moles, or the meanderings of the devil. But it sure does indicate!</p>
            <p>What is the feeling like? Imagine, those of you who are not endowed with the power, you
                    "non-witches," that you are carrying a flexible cane fishing pole across a given
                    area of land, holding it at an angle of 45 to 90 degrees. Suddenly the pole begins to bend and point
                    towards the earth—about like the pull of a half-pound sunfish or bluegill, but more
                    steady. Pass the spot and the rod straightens up again. That is the <pb n="68" id="VAA4025-056-1-078"/> feeling. The first time it happens it makes one feel foolish, silly,
                    spooky, but in time one learns to live with "the power" and to accept it as a
                    special talent which distinguishes him from the ordinary run of citizens—like being able
                    to whistle two tunes at once or always to find a parking place.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the reviewer's case may be of interest to other "witches," active
                    or potential—and the world is full of them! Though he grew up with a heritage of
                    mid-western pioneer folklore—and loved it—one thing he could not swallow was
                    "water witching." For forty years he laughed and scoffed at the idea, not only of
                    the rod locating water, but that it moved from any other motivation than that given it by the person
                    who held it. He even regarded persons who thought the rod <hi rend="i">might</hi> move because of
                    reasons unknown as being slightly "tetched" or
                    "hypoed"—and not entirely to be trusted either indoors or out in the
                    rain. Then in 1937 he started to build a house in the country. Foundation stakes were driven and a
                    stake set just off one corner to indicate the well site.</p>
            <p>When the well driller looked over the situation he asked whether it would not be a good idea to have
                    the well location "witched." The reviewer started to laugh, then suddenly realized
                    that this was an opportunity to see, firsthand, something which he knew would be a joke and a fraud,
                    but, since the fee was to be only $2.00, fairly cheap amusement even at depression
                    prices. The WPA worker selected to do the job did not keep his appointment, but the well driller
                    said that sometimes the rod worked in his hands. So the skeptical house builder sat down on a stump,
                    filled his pipe, and prepared to be amused. Within a minute, however, his eyes were popping. It was
                    obvious that those gnarled hands gripping the ends of the rod until the knuckles were white were not
                    making that rod dip.</p>
            <p>"Here, let me have that thing!" Back and forth over the same spots went the
                    skeptic. There was no more result than if he had been carrying a WPA shovel. (WPA shovels were
                    practically immovable objects.) Then the well driller said, "Sometimes it works if we join
                    hands." He was right. As long as inside hands were joined and each person held one branch
                    of the rod with his outside hand, the "non-witch" was a "witch"
                    and got the full feel of the power. Had there been any lingering doubt it was dispelled. But, if
                    contact <pb n="69" id="VAA4025-056-1-079"/> were broken, even by a quarter of an inch, the
                    "non-witch" was just an object, foolishly marching back and forth with a V-shaped
                    switch in his hand. For two hours the performance went on. Fortunately the house site was about two
                    hundred yards from the highway, otherwise passing acquaintances would probably have reported strange
                    goings on in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richland</settlement>
                    </placeName> Township by that college professor feller. Surely the well driller must have added
                    several feet to the cost of the well for services rendered beyond the call of duty. Coincidentally,
                    the spot where the well stake was driven proved to be the strongest pulling spot within a
                    half-acre—it still is—and a five thousand-gallon-per-day well was brought in,
                    but the well would have been drilled at that spot regardless, and there is no doubt that the amount
                    of water would have been the same, "witch" confirmation or no.</p>
            <p>A few days later the mistress of the new home-to-be, though somewhat bored with a description of the
                    foregoing events, was persuaded to try her success with the rod—the same one used by the
                    well driller. No sooner had she tried to set it in position than the butt end flew back and hit her
                    in the face. The rod was simply uncontrollable. She was standing too close to the "hot
                    spot." So, with a "witch" in the family, a demonstrator was usually at
                    hand for picnics and other social events, and the "non-witch" could always get a
                    vicarious thrill by holding hands with the "witch." Then one day about two years
                    later when the reviewer picked up a switch and was wandering aimlessly about, there it was.
                    "The power" had suddenly descended upon him and he has been a
                    "witch" ever since.</p>
            <p>But back to our book and the report of an experiment (p. 73) which showed failure of the diviners to
                    "locate an underground stream" and return to it blindfolded, and failure of
                    different diviners to agree on the "location of underground water." Since we do
                    not know <hi rend="i">what</hi> the rod indicates, let us take out the "underground
                    water" (which generally is not in "streams" anyway) and substitute
                    "spot which affects the rod"—hereafter called the "hot
                    spot." The reviewer will offer very fair odds in depreciated promises to
                    pay—commonly called dollars—that the rod in his hands will dip at the same
                    spots in fair weather or foul, in broad daylight or darkest night, whether he is dressed in swimming
                    trunks or formal clothes, blindfolded or both eyes wide open. Further, <pb n="70" id="VAA4025-056-1-080"/> he will offer even odds that the rod in the hands of any given number
                    of "witches"— whether card carrying members of the union or mere
                    neophytes—will indicate, pull, bend down, or flop at the same spots. He will map those
                    spots in advance. (Given enough takers he feels confident that he can retire from his onerous duties
                    as a teacher and devote his time to writing scholarly and non-remunerative articles such as this. He
                    might even endow a home for retired "witches.")</p>
            <p>Then comes this choice bit (p. 33): "Another part of the folklore that crops up now and then
                    in our American sample is the idea that a person who is not gifted as a diviner can temporarily gain
                    the ‘power’ if he is in physical contact with a gifted person." If by
                    "folklore" is meant myth, something said or believed which isn't true,
                    this statement itself is certainly "folklore." Physical contact always works, or
                    at least it has never failed in several hundred trials. Perhaps the ten-thousandth case might prove
                    to be a blooper, who knows. At any rate we offer odds of ten to one on this one and should come out
                    better off than the "house" or the government on the pari-mutuels or the
                    "one-armed bandits." Contact even "works" through a circle of
                    persons. With one or more "witches" inside the circle and end men who are
                    "non-witches" grasping the ends of the rod, it sometimes appears that the effect
                    is more potent than in the hands of the "witches" singly. Surely the authors, who
                    have delved into this subject so deeply, have not denied themselves this intriguing and confusing
                    experience.</p>
            <p>Now for the most interesting—and controversial—part of the book. Chapter VI,
                    "Why Does the Rod Move?," presents two general theories: (1) that it moves from
                    physical causes, and (2) that the cause is psychological.</p>
            <p>Chief among the physical causes is supposed to be the internal stress or tension which the V-shaped
                    rod suffers when the diviner "pushes the two forks toward one another to create the
                    tautness in the rod," (it works better when they are pulled apart), and hence slight
                    rotation of the wrists will cause the rod to move. Sounds good, BUT: Since the tension is present in
                    anyone's hands, why doesn't the rod work for anyone? And why, in the hands of the
                    "witch" does it work only at certain places? And why will the rod always go
                    forward if the "hot spot" is in front of the rod holder and always go backward if
                    it is behind him? Unless someone <pb n="71" id="VAA4025-056-1-081"/> can answer these questions by
                    way of the laws of mechanics, we can drop the internal tension theory.</p>
            <p>Still more difficult to accept is the second theory that the rod moves because of unconscious
                    "muscular activity" ("motor automatism," "ideomotor
                    action," "cryptesthesia" or whatnot).</p>
            <quote rend="blockquote">
                    <p>According to this explanation, "the dowser. … is a person endowed with a
                        supernormal cognitive faculty, which, its nature being unknown we call, after Professor Richet,
                        cryptesthesia By means of this cryptesthesia, knowledge of whatever object is searched for
                        enters the dowser's subconcious and is revealed by means of an unconscious muscular
                            reaction."<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
               </p>
                </quote>
            <p>Freely translated into English this statement would appear to mean that the "witch"
                    has an idea in his head which someway or other comes out through his muscles and effects the rod.
                    This theory the authors agree with "in part."</p>
            <p>So—they wind up with a chapter (V) on "From Talking Horses to Talking
                    Twigs," which in between these two topics covers revolving tables (from the laying on of
                    hands), Ouija boards, and "mind reading" feats. This is an interesting chapter but
                    in the reviewer's humble (?) judgment has about as much to do with what makes the rod move
                    as it would with planting potatoes or running a bulldozer. What if the counting horse's
                    trainer did reveal the time to stop pawing by some slight facial or muscular movement? (Talking
                    horses are fairly common, but can one always believe what they say? Talking tables are scarcer but
                    more easily housed, and it costs less to feed them.) And what would be the relation between the fact
                    that some persons can make an Ouija board talk and the fact that a magnet will make a piece of iron
                    jump through the air-but not a piece of copper. The authors admit (p. 120) that some persons might
                    question whether these subjects have a common denominator with witching, hence they decide
                    "to look more closely at the behavior of the rod and also bring to our aid laboratory
                    experiments on suggestibility and hypnosis."</p>

                </p>
            <p>Let us tackle points two through six en masse and all at once. One is tempted to reply in the
                    parlance of the realm used by General McAuliffe when he communicated with the Germans. Let us say
                    rather that it would appear that someone has been pulling someone's leg. Perhaps there has
                    also been some occupational build-up and showing off on the part of operating witches to make their
                    labor appear more difficult and important, like the smoke screen of meaningless jargon laid down by
                    bureaucrats. (Really, there is nothing like it.) Slipping a slider low over the N.E. corner of the
                    home plate, driving a golf ball, or dodging drivers in traffic requires some concentration, some
                    coordination between mind and muscle, but "witching," that is holding the rod
                    while it does its stuff, requires no more concentration than turning a door knob, stubbing
                    one's toe, or falling down stairs. One can do it while dancing a jig, reading a newspaper
                    aloud or- if someone would hold it-tooting a tuba horn. As for that "intense emotional
                    experience," it is about the same as sneezing or tying a shoelace, and as for
                    "physical exhaustion," about the same as lighting a cigarette—with a
                    match, not a <pb n="73" id="VAA4025-056-1-083"/> lighter. So, not being in this complex state, how
                    can the diviner be "<hi rend="i">receptive to cues</hi> of which he is not consciously
                    aware"?</p>
            <p>Point No. 7 states that the "divining ability improves with practice." The reviewer
                    knows of no evidence to support such a statement.</p>
            <p>Point No. 8 is as follows: "The diviner has no feedback from his arms to tell him that his
                    muscles are initiating the action; he is <hi rend="i">unaware</hi> of any involvement on the part of
                    his muscles until after the rod has begun its move, and he feels that his hands are trying to
                    prevent the action."</p>
            <p>This is revealing. Not only is there no "feedback," but the diviner is unaware of
                    any involvement of his muscles (that is, in making the rod move) because there isn't any.
                    And he feels that "his hands are trying to prevent the action" because they are.
                    What is the natural muscular response when someone suddenly trys to snatch something out of
                    one's hands? Is it to relax the hands or to hold on tighter?</p>
            <p>Point No. 9: "Not only is the diviner unaware of any muscular involvement on his part but he
                    seems to have a defensive need to assert (even when no one questions him) his innocence in regard to
                    the rod's behavior."</p>
            <p>Is it the "witch" who protests his innocence first or is it the skeptic who accuses
                    him of manipulating the rod who usually takes the offensive? And if one is accused of a heinous
                    crime, isn't it natural for him "to assert his innocence"? Or even if he
                    is accused of merely being a faker?</p>
            <p>Next the psychologists are brought forth, William James among others, with their explanations of
                    "ideomotor action," that is, the theory that "<hi rend="i">ideas</hi> may
                    become the sources of muscular movement, independently either of volitions or of emotions."</p>
            <p>Could be, in many things, but not in handling the rod. If so, how come the "witch"
                    can <hi rend="i">consciously</hi>, and with all the strength of his grip (and to get a better grip,
                    leave several stubs of smaller branches near the ends of the rod to fit between the crotches of the
                    fingers), try to turn the rod the <hi rend="i">opposite</hi> way to that which it wants to go
                    without success. Remember, <hi rend="i">if the witch's grip is strong enough, the rod will
                        eventually twist itself in two as a result of the opposing forces.</hi> AND HOW DOES ONE ACCOUNT
                    FOR THE FACT THAT THE ROD WILL ACT JUST THE SAME IF HELD IN THE JAWS OF TWO PAIRS OF PLIERS? Do <pb n="74" id="VAA4025-056-1-084"/>
                    <hi rend="i">their</hi> "implicit muscular responses accompany thinking" (p. 137)?
                    What muscular responses? Whose thinking? The reviewer will believe this when he sees a pair of
                    pliers on a table begin to snap and rotate its jaws because someone had an idea it ought to.</p>
            <p>Other sections of this chapter deal with "Ideomotor Action and Suggestibility," and
                    hypnotic susceptibility and posthypnotic suggestibility tests. There is no doubt that these tests
                    are valid in many instances, but do they apply to the subject in hand? The reviewer does not believe
                    that they do. He has yet to learn of an eight-foot high jump or a 350-yard golf drive brought off as
                    a result of suggestion, either before, during, or after hypnosis or otherwise. He imagines there
                    would be a fairly good cash reward for any psychologist or hypnotist who can produce such results.</p>
            <p>For persistent doubters of the rod's pull, or better still for those hard-boiled cynics who
                    accuse the "witch" of manipulating it, the following stunt works often enough to
                    be worth trying: Cut a heavy rod with a butt about the diameter of a healthy broom handle. (If you
                    are real mean and vindictive, you may load the butt with nails or lead.) Try out the doubting Thomas
                    in an area where the attraction is weak—just strong enough to determine whether or not he
                    is a "witch." If he is—and the chances are perhaps one to five or six
                    that he is—then lead him in front of a "hot spot," or back him into it.
                    The first time the butt of the rod smacks him between the eyes he will probably whirl around to see
                    who did it. Reactions to successive blows are likely to be varied. If the subject of this experiment
                    should be a psychologist, ask him whether the bump on his forehead resulted from his own idea that
                    he should whack himself on the head or whether it was suggested to him by someone.</p>
            <p>Some years ago the reviewing "witch" was tormented by two scientists until he
                    finally persuaded them either to "put up or shut up." As he had hoped, one of
                    them—the most satirical-turned out to be a "witch." For several
                    hours—until darkness intervened—said scientist paraded back and forth trying
                    to stop the rod from turning. Finally, thinking he was out of hearing distance, he threw down the
                    rod and said: "Damn it, there isn't any such thing.—But there
                    is!" From that day until he left for other parts, he would never discuss
                    "witching."</p>
            <pb n="75" id="VAA4025-056-1-085"/>
            <p>The authors conclude Chapter VI with a statement of their belief that "the rod's
                    behavior is a problem for psychology and physiology." Yet on the last page (152) they seem
                    to admit that the cause of the rod's action is not known: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>This is not to say that there are no unknowns in the story of the rod's behavior.
                            There are sufficient unsolved problems to challenge the physiologist and psychologist for
                            many decades to come. But these problems are not peculiar to water witching. They are
                            problems involving the more general questions of human behavior—problems such as
                            how stimuli initiate sensory and motor behavior, the complicated and elusive problem of
                            consciousness and awareness, and the dramatic manifestations that occur in abnormal and
                            emotional behavior.</p>
                    </quote>
                </p>
            <p>The remainder of the book is, to the reviewer, a sort of anticlimax. Chapter VII,
                    "Who's Who in Witching," indicates there are relatively few young
                    "witches" or female "witches." The reviewer would guess that
                    there are as many or more female "witches" than male. After all, are not women
                    filled with more mysterious powers than men? Intuition for instance. Also, data collected by the
                    authors seem to justify the belief that "water witching is something that thrives only
                    among the uneducated" (p. 161). Eliminating the word "water" and assuming
                    that college students, college graduates, and college professors are "educated,"
                    then the percentage of "witches" among the uneducated must be quite large.</p>
            <p>Statistics in Chapter VIII, "For Whom the Witch Tells," show that the number of
                    "water diviners" in the 358 counties sampled varies from zero to 343 per 100,000
                    population; the average is 18 per 100,000. Certainly this low figure has little or no
                    "correlation coefficient" to the number of "witches." Almost any
                    county probably. has several hundred "witches." The only thing is they
                    don't know that they are "witches" or, if they do, do not go around
                    trying to locate wells. Other data show that the practice of witching for water is more common in
                    rural than in urban regions, and in locations which have water problems than in those which do not.
                    This, of course, is to be expected.</p>
            <p>The last chapter, "Water Witching as Magical Divination" tries to provide
                    "a psychological rationale for water witching," that is, an explanation of the
                    practice of trying to locate water with the rod, which, "from the scientist's
                    viewpoint, is 'irrational' divination," divination being the "
                    'art or practice of foreseeing or foretelling future events or discovering hidden
                    knowledge'" (p. 192). The conclusion for <pb n="76" id="VAA4025-056-1-086"/> the
                    book is expressed in the first sentence of this chapter: "We have reached the conclusion
                    that water witching does not work as a reliable empirical technique to locate underground
                    water." The reviewer agrees. But what makes the rod move and why does it not move for
                    everyone? This question has not been settled.</p>
            <p>Obviously there is need for further investigation and more exact data on a number of points. Why not
                    test ten thousand people for witching propensities and determine percentages by age, sex, and
                    education? The reviewer hazards a guess that perhaps a thousand of them would prove to have
                    "the power." At any rate the number would be surprising. (What we need is not
                    fewer witch hunts but bigger and better organized ones. Some foundation, attention!) Can a
                    "non-witch" become a "witch"? See above, pp. 68-69. Can a
                    "witch" lose the power? No data exist on this at all. Someone should gather some.
                    Will the rod work when the "witch" is not in direct contact with the
                    ground—on stilts, roller skates, or in a wheel chair? (The reviewer is afraid to try
                    stilts or skates and is superstitious about the wheel chair. The rod does not work for him in his
                    car). And will it work several stories off the ground? (A fellow "witch" got some
                    strange results in a fourth-story apartment. In some rooms the switch dipped at certain corners or
                    tried to point out particular windows. In one room it sought to elongate itself <hi rend="i">upward</hi>). And will it work in an airplane? The reviewer has made no
                    "researches" along this line; he believes that there is a limit as to how far one
                    can go in calling attention to his peculiarities in public places. But someone should try it.</p>
            <p>Just one more thing—the subject of map dowsing <hi rend="i">a la</hi> Kenneth Roberts and
                    his dowser Henry Gross: How big a map—what scale—for a West Indies island or a
                    farm in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName>? In either instance the "hotspot"—which usually covers a
                    few square yards—would be a mere pinpoint in size. How witch this? And suppose a map of
                    an area devoid of "hotspots" were held over a "hotspot" on the
                    ground. Which would the rod indicate, the map or the ground? On this subject the reviewer agrees
                    with the diviner quoted on page 154 of the book: "I don't believe in it. I think
                    it's baloney."</p>
            <p>What are the reviewer's conclusions about what makes the rod work? None. What makes the bit
                    of iron jump through the air to the magnet or one mass attract another mass? Yes-lines of force, but
                    what is in those lines and <pb n="77" id="VAA4025-056-1-087"/> what do they take hold of? What
                    enables the homing pigeon to find its home? What makes the water fowl (or other bird) which has
                    never been with the flock take off at a certain time and find its way to the wintering or breeding
                    grounds? What makes lemmings go to sea periodically and commit mass suicide? What makes the seedling
                    vine grow <hi rend="i">toward</hi> the nearest support? What makes people want to go to the moon?</p>
            <p>Who knows? Perhaps, the explanation offered by Henry Mager (<hi rend="i">Water Diviners and Their
                        Methods</hi> [<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName>, 19311) makes the most sense; he thinks there may be evidence that the rod's
                    actions are governed by the laws of electrodynamics rather than unconscious muscular action.
                    Possibly so.</p>
            <p>A generation ago Clarence W. Alvord, one of the better American historians of his day, wrote an
                    amusing and confusing article entitled "Musings of an Inebriated Historian.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> In it Alvord got into an argument with the ghost of Henry Adams, but the
                    "inebriated" historian was no match for Adams' ghost, stone sober. So it
                    is with this article on "witching," which might be retitled "The
                    Bedizened Bemusings of a Bewitched Historian." The historian hasn't much of a
                    chance against the scientists, but he is sure that he has the "witches" on his
                    side. Perhaps the "pro witch" view as expressed by a disciple of Bleton almost a
                    century and a half ago may eventually prevail: <quote rend="blockquote">

                    the beginning. But as Galileo said, "And yet it does move!"</p>

            <p>To judge a man's character or to evaluate his contributions to his fellow man on the basis
                    of a few personal traits and an equally few events selected from a long and active life is at best
                    presumptuous. But, through the medium of history texts, this type of judgement too often forms the
                    essence of Benjamin Harrison in the minds of students in survey courses in American history.
                    Harrison, if remembered at all, may be remembered as a president (and who usually hears he was
                    anything but a president) who had "some political experience," or who has the
                    dubious honor of being "one of the more notable presidential nonentities." Or, as
                    just the grandson of William Henry, he has been described as "colorless in personality,
                    cold in manner, and singularly aloof."</p>
            <p>In this second volume of a proposed three-volume biography, Father Sievers' meticulous
                    research has produced a most readable and probably definitive account of an energetic, warm, and
                    human Harrison who was more than Indiana's only president. One who participated actively in
                    state and national politics for more than two decades, including a term as <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> senator, and, who for the same period was leader of his states' Republican
                    party, certainly had "some political experience." One who was the financial fount
                    for more dependent relatives than any one person should have, and who, for over forty years, was an
                    indefatigable leader in his church must have been more than colorless, cold, and aloof. One whose
                    integrity was unimpeached and who was known far beyond the limits of his state as a skillful
                    prosecutor and defense attorney should escape the singular appellation of nonentity. These facts and
                    more are revealed by Father Sievers as he exhumes this Hoosier statesman from his traditional and
                    rather ignominious historical tomb.</p>
            <p>The fact that we see possibly too little of Harrison's non-public life, and the fact that we
                    are never quite certain why Senator Morton's shadow engulfed Harrison's political
                    aspirations for twelve years may disturb some readers. The chapter, "The Harrison
                    Horror," concerned with a body snatching episode in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, though a part of the Harrison story, may appear to be somewhat extraneous. It might
                    also be suspected that the author is captivated by his subject and fails to record
                    Harrison's unfavorable features, which are popularly expected in any person engaged in a
                    public career-but possibly there were none.</p>
            <p>The revelations in the second volume cause one to suspect that the final volume, may it not be too
                    long in creation, will prove that Harrison's administration was notable for more than just
                    the wiring of the executive mansion for electricity.</p>

            <p>With a barrister's skill, lawyer-author Cuneo has presented a convincing defense of the
                    famed Indian fighter, Robert Rogers. He has traced the life of this colorful, yet tragic, figure
                    from his humble beginnings in 1730 as the fourth son of a <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nhu">New Hampshire</region>
                    </placeName> squatter to his place in the sun when, not yet thirty, he was "the
                    army's most famous colonial fighter, to whom all society was open" (p. 143). The
                    account continues through Rogers' successive disappointments—flights from
                    creditors, court-martial, debtors' prisons, disease and intemperance—until he
                    died in 1795, broken in mind and body. The hazards of his uncivilized frontier world had proved as
                    nothing compared to the dangers and pitfalls of the civilized world which he was ill fitted to
                    combat.</p>
            <p>A poor frontier farmer tempted into a counterfeiting scheme, Rogers was saved by the outbreak of the
                    French and Indian War wherein he rose to a position of eminence as commander of a "Company
                    of Rangers." Numerous feats of daring in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crown Point</settlement>
                    </placeName>-Ticonderoga area won for him a reputation both in America and abroad. Yet every
                    accomplishment won also an increasing degree of professional jealousy from General Thomas Gage. The
                    fact that Amherst ignored Gage's attempts to discredit both Rogers and the Rangers only
                    intensified Gage's hostility.</p>
            <p>After Gage became commander of the British forces in America, he was in a position to vent his spleen
                    and succeeded in impeaching Rogers for treason while the latter served as commandant of the
                    Michilimackinac post. Cuneo devotes several interesting pages to the court case, as one might
                    expect, and, according to his evidence, anything but a complete acquittal would have permanently
                    stained the integrity of British courts-martial. Both Rogers' defense and Cuneo's
                    reporting make dramatic reading.</p>
            <p>The interbellum years found Rogers in and out of debtors' prisons, and at the outbreak of
                    the Revolutionary War he offered his services to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Since he was a retired British major, he was suspect in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s eyes, however; and after being arrested by the patriots and threatened with
                    imprisonment, he escaped to the British and offered his services to them. He formed another Ranger
                    unit and for a brief period terrorized the settlements of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName> until his battalion was taken over by the British Regulars. For all practical purposes
                    the story ends here, for the author condenses the remainder of Rogers' life into only a few
                    pages since there is a paucity of source material for after this time. It apparently is just as
                    well, for Rogers' career from this point on, judging from what evidence is available, was a
                    tragedy of degradation, divorce, drunkenness, and debt.</p>
            <p>The author freely consults Rogers' own books, <hi rend="i">A Concise Account of North
                        America and Journals</hi>, as well as an impressive list of source materials from depositories
                    in this country, <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>, and Great Britain. Yet, it is lamentable that space limitations did not permit more
                    specific <pb n="81" id="VAA4025-056-1-091"/> references to sources than the general lists of
                    materials at the end of the volume. Cuneo indicates that those wishing to pursue the topic further
                    can find detailed notes on deposit at the New-York Historical Society and at the Clements Library,
                    University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Students of Rogers' period will welcome Cuneo's volume. It is a competent work that
                    does much to present a clear and concise account of this exciting partisan leader whose life has
                    been much clouded by folklore, fancy, and fiction. Cuneo writes well—his terse, pithy
                    style makes the exposition as dynamic as his subject matter.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Observation of his father's work and his own job as a "lay

               </placeName>, in 1833 and made a thriving business
                    out of it. In 1847 the mill was destroyed by fire, but it was rebuilt and by 1850 the enterprise was
                    valued at more than $50,000. Subsequent floods and fires damaged the mill repeatedly, but
                    each time it was repaired or rebuilt and for a time furnished all the paper used by the state
                    printers and most of the newsprint used by <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Frankfort</settlement>
                    </placeName> newspapers. The Civil War bankrupted the business, and in 1875 the DuPonts purchased
                    the mill machinery.</p>
            <p>The reader will be fascinated by Stedman's lively and colorful description of his business
                    and also of society in the Bluegrass region. He pens interesting character sketches of his
                    acquaintances, describes details of the papermaking industry, bills of fare of that day, the life of
                    rivermen, squirrel migrations, and many other aspects of frontier life. Although tinged with
                    nostalgia and containing some errors of fact, Stedman's account shows his remarkable
                    ability to recall minute details (he began writing in 1878). The editors prove that his memory is
                    surprisingly good. For an uneducated man, the old papermaker had a large vocabulary and an engaging
                    style of writing. His spelling is poor, but at least phonetic. One wonders, however, why he stumbles
                    over such words as "her" and "see," yet correctly spells others
                    like "consanguinity" and "anomalous."</p>
            <pb n="82" id="VAA4025-056-1-092"/>
            <p>The editors deserve much praise for their efforts. Often in works of this kind the reader is baffled
                    by an imposing array of footnotes; such is not the case here. Perhaps a few more might have been in
                    order, such as a note on Cassius Clay (p. 189) and one to clarify lines five and six on page 152. It
                    was not the "Alien and Sedition Law" under which Matthew Lyon was jailed, but the
                    Sedition Act (p. xvi). The introduction is quite helpful, as is the index. The book is valuable for
                    an understanding of both early papermaking and frontier society.</p>

            <p>David Lindsey has written a lively and significant life of Samuel Sullivan Cox, better known as
                    "Sunset" Cox, whose political career spanned most of the latter half of the
                    nineteenth century. As a Democrat, Cox was elected to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> House of Representatives from the <placeName>

               </placeName>, district in
                    1856 and served continuously from 1857 until 1865. Gerrymandered out of his position by a hostile
                    Republican legislature in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> in 1865, Cox moved to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York City</settlement>
                    </placeName>, was again elected to the House of Representatives in 1868, and served regularly with
                    but two brief breaks until his death in 1889. Although a candidate for the position of speaker on
                    several occasions, Cox never received this honor, but he did serve competently as speaker pro tem at
                    various times and missed by a hair being chosen permanent speaker in 1876.</p>
            <p>Cox was in Congress during the political crisis of the 1850's, the Civil War itself, the
                    political battles of Reconstruction, and the political drift of the Gilded Age. He witnessed the
                    spectacular rise of the Republican party to a quarter century of power. At the same time he was a
                    part of the split in his own party with its subsequent eclipse. But he was also a part of the slow
                    revival and recovery of the Democratic party from the lean years of the war and Reconstruction, and
                    he was on hand when the Democrats regained control of the White House and Congress in the
                    mid-eighties.</p>
            <p>It is in this political milieu that Cox had three decades of active leadership. If he is classifiable
                    at all, says Professor Lindsey, "he may perhaps be best described as a conservative in the
                    Jeffersonian tradition. His was a belief in a simple, modest, frugal federal government of strictly
                    limited powers, as defined in the Constitution, coupled with respect for states rights and local
                    government where the decisions could be made by the people most directly affected" (p.
                    259). While Professor Lindsey feels that it is difficult to measure Cox's influence upon
                    the course of American politics from the 1850's to the 1880's, he does conclude
                    that the course of American public affairs might have moved along different lines had Cox not lived
                    during the period. He did attempt to prevent secession. Yet despite his compromise efforts, when the
                    break in the Union came, he supported the Lincoln administration <pb n="83" id="VAA4025-056-1-093"/>
                    in its military efforts even though he deplored the use of armed force to pull the Union together
                    again. Yet he wanted no more of war than to restore the Uniog, and thus he opposed efforts at change
                    such as the emancipation of slaves and the raising of the tariff. These, he argued, were measures of
                    revolution not of restoration. But when Cox became convinced that emancipation was not an obstacle
                    to the restoration of the Union, he moved to support it, although in the end he did vote against the
                    Thirteenth Amendment. He opposed Radical Reconstruction, the disabilities imposed upon the
                    Confederates, the Force Bills of 1870-1871, Greenbacks, railroad land grants, and a high tariff. He
                    was a champion of a low-tariff policy, resumption, better wages and working conditions for letter
                    carriers, and of a Lifesaving Service.</p>
            <p>Grover Cleveland spoke of Cox's "honorable career" and 'useful
                    life"; John Hay said about Cox that "few men have ever lived more universally
                    loved and admired; few have ever died more sincerely mourned" (p. 256); and William M.
                    Evarts stated that "through thirty years among the eminent men of the Democratic party in
                    the state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>," there had been "no one that can be fairly considered as having been
                    more engaged in public affairs than Mr. Cox" (p. 268). Thus Cox deserved a scholarly
                    biography, and Professor Lindsey has provided us with one. It is a first-class book, scholarly in
                    every respect and thoroughly documented, and Professor Lindsey is to be commended for his excellent
                    performance here. The research is sound and is based upon extensive work among Cox's own
                    writings and speeches and upon a variety of manuscripts, government documents, party documents,
                    newspapers and periodicals, and books, articles, and unpublished dissertations. Professor
                    Lindsey's book makes two contributions: one to the field of political biography, and
                    another to the general field of American politics from the 1850's until the late
                    1880's. It will be useful, informative, and entertaining to students of American politics
                    of the latter half of the nineteenth century.</p>

            <p>This study of a <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wisconsin county</region>
                    </placeName> is indirectly an outgrowth of the work of Frederick Jackson Turner. In his day,
                    numerous historical forces were studied by him, and where possible their presence or influence was
                    indicated on maps, perhaps to increase the objectivity of his work. He dealt extensively with census
                    statistics, particularly of population and agriculture. At various times he expressed his conviction
                    that the frontier exerted a democratic influence upon the people living there.</p>
            <p>One of Turner's students, Merle Curti, Frederick Jackson Turner Professor of History at the
                    University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>, directed this study and became the principal author of the volume. He consulted the
                        <pb n="84" id="VAA4025-056-1-094"/> usual categories of source materials as well as the
                    manuscript records of the census. Curti sought to increase the objectivity of this history by
                    applying the latest machine methods to his investigation. By employing punch cards and business
                    machines, he was able to study the entire population of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Trempealeau County</region>
                    </placeName>. This procedure is not only more scientific than other means, but it gives to his
                    conclusion a wider base of support. But this study is not merely concerned with demonstrating new
                    methods of handling data; it is also intended to test Curti's interpretation of
                    Turner's theory, particularly in relation to the democratic influence of the frontier.</p>
            <p>The conclusions are of particular interest. For certain questions and problems, the combination of
                    long-accepted procedure with certain quantitative methods used in the social sciences (these methods
                    are described in Appendix 1) is feasible and useful. A higher degree of objectivity was attained.</p>
            <p>A large turnover of settlers was found, and in the fluid society that resulted, immigrant groups as
                    well as native Americans made excellent economic adjustments. Immigrants increasingly entered
                    business and the professions, intermarried with Americans, participated in politics, and became
                    landowners. A majority of the "farmers" without farms did have land, and even farm
                    laborers as a group were by no means landless. "Practically all new settlers who remained
                    in the county made striking advance…. The rich became somewhat richer, the poor became a
                    good deal less poor…. All but one of the young men who had started as farm laborers in
                    1860 were farm owners in 1880" (p. 445). Some of these results may have been the outcome of
                    a postwar boom, but the authors believe that the stimulus and opportunity were largely provided by
                    frontier conditions.</p>
            <p>"Frontier experiences in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Trempealeau</region>
                    </placeName> promoted self-confidence, optimism, resourcefulness, perseverance, … as well
                    as individual initiative and sense of responsibility…. Decisions were made, and remade,
                    in accordance with the democratic principle of majority rule and consideration of minority
                    interests" (p. 447). For a time disparity in educational opportunity existed, but with
                    later developments it was lessened. "Turner's poetical vision of free land and of
                    relatively equal opportunity was for a great many people being realized in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Trempealeau County</region>
                    </placeName>. The story of the making of this American community is a story of progress toward
                    democracy" (p. 448).</p>
            <p>Little objection can be offered to the methods of procedure, the industry of the researchers, and the
                    conclusions of Curti's volume. Two decisions in the research could not be highly objective,
                    and yet they may have influenced in some degree the final conclusions. The reader may ask why <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Trempealeau County</region>
                    </placeName> was chosen and not be entirely satisfied with the authors' answer, even though
                    no very satisfactory reason occurs for not choosing it. Only the study of other counties will reveal
                    the wisdom of the choice. The reader may also question the use of eleven contiguous townships in the
                    area between Montpelier and <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Burlington</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
               </placeName>, as a "control area"
                    for purposes of comparison. Why <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName>, particularly in view of its mountainous topography? Why not an industrial area?</p>
            <pb n="85" id="VAA4025-056-1-095"/>
            <p>Within its particular field this study is unique, and it is a valuable and significant study in its
                    larger implications as well. The critics of Turner's interpretation have not produced a
                    critique having such solid foundations. It is interesting to note that a midwestern university
                    furnished graduate student assistants and a grant to further the research.</p>

            <p>This is the third in a series of elaborate pictorial history books to be published by the American
                    Heritage Publishing Company, and is, in the reviewer's mind, the most interesting of the
                    three. (American Heritage Book of Great Historic Places was published in 1957 and <hi rend="i">American Heritage Book of the Revolution</hi> in 1958.)</p>
            <p>The "Pioneer Spirit" is broadly construed; it includes much more than the conquest
                    of the continent by means of the rifle, axe, and plow. The book contains sections on
                    "Foot-holds of the Forest," "Adventures in Independence,"
                    "Manifest Destiny," "A Tinkering People" (inventions), and
                    "The Strenuous Life," as well as ten others. There are subsections on clipper
                    ships, utopian schemes, buffaloes, cowboys, reformers, dime novels, the factory system, and many
                    other subjects. The introduction and chapter prologues are written by Allan Nevins, and the text
                    which accompanies the pictures has been written by a number of journalist-historians.</p>
            <p>From the early pages on "Breaking the Ocean Barrier" to the building of the Panama
                    Canal and the coming of the airplane the reader is confronted by almost 500 pictures, 160 of them in
                    full color and many of them double-page. In the early sections there are reproductions of rare maps;
                    the reader would have to visit numerous libraries to see these in the original. One naturally
                    expects reproductions of the paintings of such well-known artists as Bodmer, Bingham, Miller, and
                    Remington, but one is hardly prepared for the gallery of portraits. The reviewer, for instance,
                    confronted face to face for the first time historical acquaintances of fifty years standing; he had
                    never realized how handsome a man was General John Forbes nor how tremendous a piece of humanity was
                    Johan Printz. Distribution of pictures is good although the more spectacular Far West seems to be
                    somewhat favored over the less spectacular but no less important frontier development east of the <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The accompanying text is sprightly and in general historically accurate, though there are some
                    serious lapses. For example on the Constitution of 1787 the text states that a national government
                    was organized (p. 112); there is no mention whatever of the fact that a dual government was
                    established with a division of powers between the states and the general government. We also learn
                    that "the Continental Congress by a momentous clause [in the Northwest <pb n="86" id="VAA4025-056-1-096"/> Ordinance of 1787] forever debarred slavery from the
                    Northwest" (p. 107), and that "<placeName>

                    (p. 186).</p>
            <p>There is a special folio (sixteen pages) of quotations which illustrate the spirit of "The
                    Promised Land." These quotations extend in time from Plato to Carl Sandburg, and, though
                    each reader who is familiar with our history will probably think he could have selected some better

            <p>The publication of comprehensive editions of prominent Americans' papers during the past
                    thirty years has been a heartening historiographical development. Several projects of the
                    1950'8, including the <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>, <region type="county">Clay</region>
               </placeName>, and Calhoun papers, were inspired in part by
                    counsel and encouragement of the National Historical Publications Commission, directed by Dr. Philip
                    M. Hamer. Sundry groups and persons—advisory and publications committees, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName> Archives Commission, the South Caroliniana Society, libraries, and
                    historians—contributed to the Calhoun project, but the major responsibility for
                    originating the proposed fifteen volumes of the South Carolinian's papers must be credited
                    to Robert L. Meriwether. He planned the entire work to serve a twofold purpose: to reproduce in
                    printed form Calhoun's most significant speeches, reports, and letters; and to append to
                    each volume a calendar of unpublished papers as a supplementary guide to the great collection of
                    Calhoun holdings in the South Caroliniana Library. Unfortunately, Dr. Meriwether died when Volume I
                    reached galley proof, but a "primary achievement" had already been attained. He
                    had assembled and classified all of Calhoun's "known extant words,"
                    whether in manuscript, microfilm, or photostat, an accomplishment that will promote the publication
                    of succeeding volumes under other editorship.</p>
            <p>Editorial procedure emulates the high standard maintained by similar projects in recent years. Each
                    letter, report, and speech is followed by a not—often a page or two in length-that puts
                    it in perspective with events and persons associated with it. These scholarly discussions represent
                    painstaking research and collation of different <pb n="87" id="VAA4025-056-1-097"/> texts; and they
                    indicate how far editorial responsibilities have advanced since the early years of the century. Even
                    more than the editor's introduction, the notes provide an understanding of Calhoun and his
                    writings. Footnotes identify significant persons and items that appear in the text.</p>
            <p>No one can understand completely either the nationalism or the sectionalism of the nineteenth
                    century's first half without a clear conception of Calhoun's dynamic mind and
                    restless energy. His Olympian stature in Congress is revealed in his chairmanship of the Foreign
                    Relations and Uniform Currency committees, in his sponsorship of forward-looking measures and forces
                    that personified America, and in his successful forensic encounters with John Randolph and
                    northeastern Federalists. In the years covered by the first volume of his Papers, he was a bold and
                    resourceful representative of the spirit that made Americans of 1900 characterize the past hundred
                    years as the "wonderful century."</p>
            <p>The portrait of the South Carolinian that emerges from this volume resembles closely the nationalist
                    pictured in Charles M. Wiltse's monumental biography. The speeches, reports, and letters
                    from Calhoun's six years in the lower house-85 per cent of the pages-contain both
                    confirming and supplementary evidence that reveals the ardent nationalism of a war hawk who gave
                    loyal support to an administration in which he had little confidence, who staunchly advocated war
                    with <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> for endeavoring to destroy American trade through violation of neutral rights and
                    impressment, who favored an aggressive campaign against <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>, and who battled unceasingly for support in men and money. Calhoun's advocacy
                    of a national bank, a protective tariff, and internal improvements in postwar years is already well
                    known; the Papers provide tangible evidence of his commanding position in the House and his
                    enthusiastic confidence in the future of the nation under a Constitution that should be broadly
                    construed. His support of the tariff yielded such phraseology as "the liberty and the union
                    of this country were inseparably united" fifteen years before Daniel Webster combined the
                    three oft-quoted words against nullifiers of the early 1830's.</p>

            <p>This volume of the <hi rend="i">American Exploration and Travel Series</hi> is the third edited by
                    Professor Thomas Clark, of the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. With his earlier volumes, <hi rend="i">The Formative Years</hi>, 1527-1785, <pb n="88" id="VAA4025-056-1-098"/> and <hi rend="i">The Expanding South, 1750-1835</hi>, and the early
                    works of Dr. E. Merton Coulter, those interested in southern history now have available a critical
                    bibliography of southern travel accounts covering almost four centuries.</p>
            <p>Of these works the present volume is concerned with what may be the most important period of full
                    southern growth—both geographic and institutional. Certainly the 506 books reviewed in
                    this volume will interest students of southern and local history, by area, and students of Jackson
                    or the ante-bellum South, by period. When properly used, this reference tool may serve in more
                    specialized fields such as immigration or commercial history or in specific topics of social
                    history. In many respects the same volume will be a gold mine for scholars patient enough to be
                    interested in arguments evaluating and criticizing slavery.</p>
            <p>This volume's organization is similar to that of the two earlier volumes edited by Professor
                    Clark and has many of the same conveniences and disadvantages. The book encompasses bibliographies
                    for four periods: "Cotton South, 1826-1835," by James W. Patton; "Decade
                    of Nationalism, 1836-1845," by Charles Sydnor; "Slavery South at Noontide,
                    1846-1852," by Robert G. Lunde; and "South in Sectional Crisis,
                    1852-1860," by F. Garvin Davenport. The first three sections are uniform in presentation.
                    Authors and titles are listed alphabetically in their respective chronological classifications, and
                    each volume is accompanied by a description of its format, publication dates, later editions, and
                    copy location. This information is followed by critical abstracts which vary in length according to
                    the value of the book and its relevance to travel within the South. The authors are generous to
                    include titles of no value as a warning for researchers. The fourth section has organization similar
                    to that of the first three, but Professor Davenport makes greater use of comparison in his
                    presentation. Each of his reviews ends with the sometimes repetitious listing of titles covering the
                    same period or area as the work reviewed and, in addition, titles giving contrasting views are
                    included. This sort of listing has been employed since the period is cluttered by the slavery issue
                    and consequently by less rewarding and less objective travel accounts than are available for other
                    periods.</p>
            <p>As in the first volumes the authors warn users of the bibliographies about the obvious facts that not
                    all titles are included, about the limited contact of some travelers within the South, or about
                    their preconceived prejudices. As before, the English compose the largest number of foreign
                    travelers who left accounts, but in this period the German works are generally praised as the most
                    accurate and objective narratives. The frequency of references to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName> may surprise some students of southern history, particularly those holding the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> as their regional western boundary.</p>
            <p>Readers should realize that index citations are for title entries, not pages, and that the index is
                    absolute in neither accuracy nor completeness. For best use of this valuable reference tool, and for
                    some enjoyable impressions of the Old South, the entire bibliography should be scanned. One should
                    not overlook valuable evaluations or citations connected with obscure authors or those not indicated
                    by titles.</p>

            <p>On the morning of June 9, 1863, the Union cavalry corps under Brigadier General Alfred Pleasonton
                    crossed the <geogName>Rappahannock River</geogName> on a reconnaissance in force and surprised the
                    Confederate cavalry under Major General J. E. B. Stuart at Brandy Station, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>. The fighting that resulted was the zenith of American cavalry action.</p>
            <p>In <hi rend="i">Clash of Cavalry</hi>, Fairfax Downey ranges from the topic of the feelings of a
                    northern trooper before the battle to a vivid description of the attacks of the Union divisions.
                    Clearly described are the countermoves of the Confederates, the failure of Colonel Duffie's
                    Union division to reach Brandy Station, and finally the confused and bitter fighting for
                        <geogName>Fleetwood Hill</geogName>—the key spot of the battle.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Clash of Cavalry</hi> is more than an account of the strategy and tactics of a cavalry
                    engagement. The book includes a study of the training and equipment of the cavalryman and discusses
                    the use of cavalry forces in the Civil War. There is also a comparison of Confederate and Union
                    cavalry that explains the superiority of the southern cavalry during the first years of the war.
                    Pictures of some of the important cavalry leaders, short evaluations of their training and
                    abilities, plus side lights about the manual on the saber, and poems and songs of the cavalry troops
                    give background to the battle.</p>
            <p>Some criticisms can be noted. The battle maps are good, but clearer reproductions would be more
                    helpful. A more detailed explanation of Colonel Duffie's failure to press home his attack
                    along the Stevensburg road would have been valuable. <hi rend="i">Clash of Cavalry</hi> should be
                    interesting, however, for both the student and general reader. It is an exciting and vividly told
                    story of an important Civil War cavalry battle.</p>
            <p>Another vividly told story of the Civil War appears in <hi rend="i">Gardner's Photographic
                        Sketch Book.</hi> Alexander Gardner (1821-1882) was a Scotsman whom Mathew Brady, the famous
                    Civil War photographer, brought to America in 1856. By 1858 Gardner was head of Brady's <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> "gallery," and there he made his famous studies of Lincoln and other
                    contemporary leaders. When the Civil War broke out, Gardner followed the armies with a horse-drawn
                    darkroom and made many historic photographs of the conflict, and in 1863 he formed his own
                    photographic organization in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>In 1866, Gardner published <hi rend="i">Gardner's Photographic Sketch Book of the War.</hi>
                    This publication was in two volumes and contained one hundred photographs taken by Gardner and
                    members of his organization. A text, probably written by Gardner, accompanied each photograph. Few
                    copies of the 1866 edition were sold, and in recent years this collection of Civil War photographs
                    has become a collector's item.</p>
            <pb n="90" id="VAA4025-056-1-100"/>
            <p>The present volume is a repoduction of the original two volumes in their entirety, and was made
                    possible by the cooperation of the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> Library, which loaned its copy of the original edition for reproduction. Reproduced on
                    quality paper and in the same size as in the original, the photographs show unusual crispness and
                    clarity of detail. Though partisan and including some editorial comments that would be questioned by
                    Civil War students of today, the text contributes to the understanding of each photograph. An index
                    to both the text and photographs plus an introduction by E. F. Bleiler that provides the reader with
                    general background on the collection and an explanation of the photographic processes at the time of
                    the Civil War, are useful additions to the present volume. <hi rend="i">Gardner's
                        Photographic Sketch Book of the Civil War should be an interesting and delightful addition to

            <p>The "Southern Question" has plagued the American public and the American politician
                    for over a century. Before 1860 it revolved around the "sinfulness" of the
                    slavocracy; during Reconstruction it included the controversies relating to the Negro, the Civil
                    War, and military occupation of the South; after 1880, it involved treatment of the Negro, the
                    one-party system, and the possible economic exploitation of the South. The latter three problems are
                    with the country today.</p>
            <p>In <hi rend="i">Republicans Face the Southern Question</hi> Dr. Vincent De Santis, of Notre Dame
                    University, neglects the broad implications of his title and examines only the attempts of the
                    Republicans to regain their position in the South after 187'7. Primarily, the volume is
                    even narrower in scope; it is the story of the efforts of four Republican presidents, Hayes,
                    Garfield, Arthur, and Harrison, to garner votes for their party in the former Confederate states. De
                    Santis believes that the Republican party has consistently worked to break up the Democratic
                    South" and states that "Republican lack of success in the South has not been from
                    a lack of effort" (p. 12). But as his volume itself indicates, few Republicans outside the
                    White House ever gave much attention to the South; fewer still spent campaign money there. And the
                    presidents, a cynic might charge, were interested in the area only because of its votes in the
                    nominating conventions.</p>
            <p>But whatever their reasons, various presidents did try to rebuild the Republican party in the South.
                    Hayes, after carrying only three southern states, and those probably because fellow Republicans were
                    counting the ballots, tried conciliation. He attempted to build a "conservative"
                    party by awarding patronage to former Whigs, then uneasy Bourbon Democrats, abandoning the policy of
                    military occupation, and, <pb n="91" id="VAA4025-056-1-101"/> to the disgust of many of the party
                    faithful, leaving the Negro in the lurch. In return he got nothing, for Southern Democrats could see
                    no good reason to come over to his side.</p>
            <p>Garfield and Arthur almost completely dropped Hayes's strategy. They decided to build the
                    party around the various independent movements springing up in the South, movements led by
                    dissatisfied politicians who for diverse reasons were anxious to bring Bourbon domination to an end.
                    By recognizing and giving the patronage to these leaders and ordering the Southern Republicans to
                    cooperate with them, Garfield and Arthur hoped to add Republican votes in Congress and, possibly, in
                    the electoral college. In the end the Garfield-Arthur program with the Independents collapsed,
                    leaving a residual taste of bitterness in the mouths of many forgotten southern Negro Republicans.</p>
            <p>From 1888 to 1892 Republican efforts to redeem the South centered around a quasi-return to
                    Reconstruction. Harrison's program called for strong backing for Senator Henry C.
                    Lodge's "Force Bill," which would allow federal supervision of local
                    elections. Harrison felt that if only the Republicans could get a fair count in the South they could
                    win some Congressional seats. But despite administrative pressure, many Republican senators were
                    uninterested and the bill died in the Senate. By 1896, in despair, the Republicans had returned to
                    the Garfield-Arthur policy of fusion with Independents, this time the Populists. Nothing came of
                    their efforts-the two parties could never agree on a common policy.</p>
            <p>Dr. De Santis recounts the story of these various Republican attempts to win the South with great
                    skill. Although there is little here that is new, it is the first time this information has been put
                    together into a coherent whole, The book is attractive (although the proofreading is poor) and is a
                    credit to the Johns Hopkins Press.</p>

            <p>There have been, if sweeping generalizations are permitted, two periods when the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> has been preoccupied with foreign relations. During its earliest years the new country
                    successfully wrested its course away from the European balance of power in order to promote its own
                    best interests. During its latest history it has voluntarily reentered a somewhat different balance
                    of power for the same reason. It was the ill fortune of the American people and their president,
                    1914-1917, to have to make a decision as to their role with regard to a world conflagration before
                    thinking about the country's new position had crystallized. Therefore, they did not have a
                    clearly defined standard with which to assess the relation of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> to the war.</p>
            <pb n="92" id="VAA4025-056-1-102"/>
            <p>Consequently, interpretations of the American decision for belligerency have varied. Initial judgment
                    tended to stress ideological motives. Beginning in the late twenties, cynicism attributed the
                    decision to propaganda and selfish economic interests. A second World War brought a further
                    reassessment that emphasized the pursuit of national interest by way of the Atlantic System and
                    balance of power alignments. What, then, the question naturally arises, can Dr. May's study
                    add to our understanding of this ebullient period?</p>
            <p>For one thing, May has utilized the perspective of 1959 to present a thoughtful synthesis of the
                    topic. He has given much more than usual attention to policy conflicts in the British and German
                    capitals that impinged upon American neutrality. His careful recounting of the formulation of German
                    policy and of Bethmann Hollweg's unheeded warning to his German colleagues constitutes
                    perhaps the most valuable contribution of his study.</p>
            <p>With respect to the American side of the Atlantic, the author traces carefully the evolution of
                    Wilson's attitude toward the war. The resulting judgment is favorable to the President.
                    Close analysis "cannot find the point at which he might have turned back or taken another
                    road" (p. vii). Moreover, according to May, public opinion approved all the major steps
                    along that road.</p>

                    Bibliographic notes, index. $12.50 per set.)</head>
            <p>In these two volumes the author concludes his comprehensive history of American economic thought from
                    the colonial beginnings to the year 1933. Unlike the earlier volumes, these treat a shorter period
                    of time, but one of much significance during which the nation reconverted to a peacetime economy
                    after World War I, experienced the giddy sensations of the booming twenties, and plunged downward
                    into the suffering and despair of the worst depression in its history. Professor Dorfman performs
                    the task with his customary thoroughness and with such success that the reader will regret that he
                    has decided not to go beyond 1933 for fear of losing historical perspective.</p>
            <p>Although there is quite naturally a strong emphasis upon that class of persons known as
                    "professional economists," the scope of the study is broad enough to include the
                    economic ideas and attitudes of politicians, social reformers, business and labor leaders,
                    journalists, and, where possible, the common man. Consequently, the volumes will interest many
                    people outside the economists' ranks, certainly historians, who, by the way, receive some
                    attention in connection with the interdisciplinary currents of the years from 1918 to 1933. In order
                    to accomplish his large objective, the author has necessarily consulted a great variety of
                    sources—manuscript collections, archives, public documents, newspapers, and periodicals.
                    Out of these materials are written <pb n="93" id="VAA4025-056-1-103"/> chapters on schools of
                    thought, individual theorists, and the major problems of the era. Frank W. Taussig, John R. Commons,
                    Richard T. Ely, together with rising lights like Rexford Tugwell and Paul Douglas, are a few of the
                    many figures who come forward. An inherent organizational difficulty in the volumes is the
                    compartmentation of contents, which too often resemble a biographical dictionary and make for slow
                    reading by the non-specialist.</p>
            <p>During the twenties, says Professor Dorfman, economists shared the prevailing optimism that the
                    prosperity and growth of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> would continue indefinitely. Giving little attention to the uninviting subject of
                    business cycles, they searched for measures to accelerate the rate of expansion or to distribute
                    more equitably its fruits. Very few "experts" anticipated an imminent depression,
                    or at least one of such magnitude as befell the land. Indeed, after the stock market crash of
                    October, 1929, the belief was widespread that there would not be any detrimental general effects of
                    the sudden halt to wild speculation in securities. Nevertheless, the decade witnessed substantial
                    progress by scholars toward increased economic knowledge and improved techniques of research which
                    were later useful in combating the depression. In fact, major ideas adopted by both the Hoover and
                    Roosevelt administrations had taken shape by 1929: industrial codes of fair practice, minimal labor
                    standards, agricultural crop restriction, and reforms of money, credit, and banking. All these
                    measures owed much to pioneering work in such new fields as labor relations, industrial management,
                    agricultural economics, international trade, governmental policy, and sociological-psychological
                    forces. Older classical economics, propounding universal laws, gave way to new approaches of a
                    pragmatic, behavior-istic, and institutional character. The goal was now not to define an inflexible
                    theory of value but to recognize the infinite number of variables operating within realistic
                    conditions.</p>
            <p>Both in its depth and its breadth this work is most satisfactory. It will be received with the
                    enthusiastic approval that it deserves, and it will remain for a long time an excellent reference in
                    the fields of economics and history.</p>

            <p>Anniversary histories, especially those of commercial ventures, are frequently either monotonous
                    chronicles or biased laudations. As one would expect of him, Professor Buley has avoided both of
                    these errors in the One Hundredth Anniversary History of the Equitable. To say that his narrative is
                    interesting is not to condemn it with faint praise.</p>
            <p>It is doubtless easier to write an interesting story if the characters are interesting people. In
                    this respect the author has full cooperation from the cast he has selected. Certainly the men who
                    founded and <pb n="94" id="VAA4025-056-1-104"/> guided the destinies of Equitable have been
                    independent and vigorous specimens of the human race.</p>
            <p>Professor Buley writes in a clear, forceful style, using anecdote and quotation to advantage. Far
                    from being an account of a "soulless" corporation, this book is an intensely human
                    document tracing the evolution of the Equitable Life Assurance Society from its origin one hundred
                    years ago. Only in the final portion, which deals with the contemporary period, does the personal
                    become somewhat subordinate to a description of the magnitude of corporate operations. Perhaps this
                    change in emphasis from the personal to the impersonal is inevitable in dealing with such a vast
                    enterprise.</p>
            <p>In addition to furnishing an account of the Equitable Society, this work throws much light upon life
                    insurance as a social institution. The author deals objectively with such subjects as inter-company
                    competition, relations between the company and investment and commercial banking interests, foreign
                    operations, the insurance "investigations," and government regulations.</p>
            <p>The men who have led the Equitable Society have not been infallible, nor does the author represent
                    them as such. On occasion they have disagreed among themselves and with their competitors. Professor
                    Buley does suggest that they have consistently sought to conduct a business which meets a special
                    need in the social order and that they have done this well. His treatment is convincing, and the
                    thesis is supported by the facts presented.</p>
            <p>The reader cannot escape being impressed by the enormity of the growth of Equitable and the life
                    insurance business as a whole. In the opinion of this reviewer, one of the most significant
                    contributions the author has made is in describing the evolution of the form and content of life
                    insurance contracts. The changing patterns of the sales organization and sales policies are also
                    effectively presented.</p>
            <p>The style of writing is such that this book may be read with equal interest by the insurance
                    fraternity and the general reader. The reviewer assumes that reference notes were omitted because
                    the book is general in character. Historians may regret this omission. In 1926, William Alexander,
                    the secretary of the society, upon the occasion of his retirement after fifty-seven years of service
                    with the organization, stated, "I should like to be here on the Equitable's One
                    Hundredth Birthday when presumably the history of the Equitable's First Century will be
                    written by some competent historian having accurate knowledge of all the facts. Such a story will be
                    as interesting as the history of a great nation, and the record of the achievements of its
                    presidents and others who have aided in its building, will be as interesting as the achievements of
                    the rulers of a nation" (pp. 261-262). If Alexander were here today he would not be
                    disappointed.</p>
            <p>The format of the book is attractive, dignified, and in keeping with the character of Equitable. The
                    text, the typography, and the illustrations, especially the reproductions of cartoons and
                    advertisements, combine to create a distinctive volume.</p>

                    </placeName> Press, 1959. Pp. xi, 232. References, index. $4.50.)</head>
            <p>Professor Charles S. Hyneman, of Indiana University, proposes in this volume to diagnose the present
                    state of American political science and to illumine some of the major issues facing members of the
                    profession. He divides his essay into three parts. He first outlines the problems that most trouble
                    political scientists, e.g.: Do they spend too much time in public affairs and too little at
                    scholarship? Do they try to cover far more ground in their studies than can effectively be embraced
                    by one discipline? Is their work adequately related to the efforts of other disciplines that study
                    social relationships? Second, Hyneman describes the scholarly undertakings of political scientists.
                    These entail description of legal governments, examination of political ideas, development of a
                    scientific literature, and presentation of normative doctrine and proposals for social action.
                    Finally he indentifies the major issues of intellectual conflict among American political
                    scientists, e.g.: Are workers in the field scientific enough in method and purpose? What is the
                    proper place of values in political science? Does study of the "classics" serve
                    any useful purpose for contemporary students?</p>
            <p>It is of course not possible for so brief a survey of so many and and such fundamental problems to do
                    more than indicate the fields of battle and the probable lines of attack and defense. In attaining
                    this goal Professor Hyneman's lucid if at times repetitive book succeeds admirably. It is
                    intended for graduate students, but it is an outline of problems confronting American political
                    science today which can be used profitably by teachers as well.</p>
            <p>Particularly helpful is Professor Hyneman's suggesting in which areas of study American
                    political science has been strong and in which it has been weak. Political scientists, for instance,
                    have done a good job in analyzing voting in public elections, but contributions to an understanding
                    of ideas essential to democracy are meager, indeed. An evaluation of the significance of
                    Christianity for politics, to give one example, has been left almost entirely to the theologians,
                    men like Barth, Maritain, and Niebuhr.</p>
            <p>Although American political scientists have devoted a substantial share of their energies to the
                    national government of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, Hyneman cites shortcomings in this field as well as in studies of state and local
                    government. As a political science teacher just completing his first year as a member of Congress,
                    the reviewer notes with particular interest the author's contention that "very
                    little" of what men and women in the American national government do and how they do it
                    "has as yet been described."</p>
            <p>Apparently, few political scientists have made much effort to make their way through the jungle that
                    is the House of Representatives of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. The task of analyzing the crosscurrents of party, personality, section, economic
                    interest, pressure groups, and constituency, which together play upon the constellation of
                    committees which constitutes the House, is a formidable one which the reviewer now appreciates <pb n="96" id="VAA4025-056-1-106"/> more readily than he did while teaching American government.
                    That the task is of great importance and that few persons are working very hard at it seems also to
                    be true. It is however encouraging to see that political scientists are beginning to tiptoe toward
                    the political reality of Congress, to mention only one branch of the federal government, through
                    various participant-observation projects.</p>
            <p>One major explanation of such gaps in our knowledge may simply be lack of imagination on the part of
                    political scientists. Last year, for example, the House battled long weeks through what veteran
                    congressmen described as the most savage legislative struggle in Congress in over ten years, the
                    issue of labor-management reform. It required no great political sophistication to know in January
                    of 1959 that this issue would be coming to a head during the first session of the Eighty-sixth
                    Congress. Some group of political scientists might well have conducted a series of confidential
                    interviews with party leaders in the House and Senate, members of the House Education and Labor
                    Committee, lobbyists of concerned organizations, and knowledgeable newspapermen—the
                    difficulties in making such arrangements notwithstanding.</p>
            <p>It is true that waiting for the smoke of battle to clear away may bring greater objectivity to an
                    investigation. It is also true that battlefield accounts may provide evidence not easily recoverable
                    at a later date or, to point to another hazard, evidence not so readily subject to what the <hi rend="i">Congressional Record</hi> knows as "extension and revision of
                    remarks."</p>
            <p>Perhaps Professor Hyneman's thoughtful book will stimulate the coming crop of American
                    political scientists to a more imaginative and fruitful use of their talents.</p>

            <p>Disregarding the usual historical or legalistic method of writing about the president's
                    cabinet, Professor Fenno declares that the cabinet is a distinct, discreet and describable political
                    institution" (p. 3). Many, although by no means all, of the precedents that Washington
                    initiated in dealing with his cabinet have remained to the present. Naturally new cabinet offices
                    have kept pace with our increasingly complex technological society as well as with our evolving
                    social conscience. Nearly all of the added cabinet departments began ae insignificant administrative
                    agencies.</p>
            <p>Although the president is supreme in relation to the cabinet, the author contends, and logically so,
                    that this group is always being "transformed by other influences in the American political
                    system" (p. 60). For example, in making cabinet appointments the chief executive recognizes
                        <pb n="97" id="VAA4025-056-1-107"/> such criteria as party, geography, personality,
                    social-economic status, etc. Very definitely, the cabinet represents the pluralism of American
                    culture.</p>
            <p>Presidents have usually had extreme difficulty in establishing and maintaining group coherence among
                    the members of the cabinet. This is understandable when one knows how deeply these advisors of the
                    president are involved in legislative activities, in bureaucracy, in the intricate machinery of
                    political parties, and in the tactics of numerous pressure groups. The author shows how chief
                    executives from Wilson to Eisenhower have sought cabinet coherence and notes that their failures
                    have far outnumbered their success.</p>
            <p>Eisenhower has many more business executives in his cabinet than did Wilson or Franklin D. Roosevelt.
                    A master politician like Roosevelt appointed a cabinet which reflected numerous political group
                    opinions within his own party and at times contained recruits from the opposition. Contrary to
                    popular belief, most presidents have difficulty in finding persons of national reputation to fill
                    cabinet berths. By and large, cabinets have been composed of obscure personnel.</p>
            <p>Until recently the cabinet was a group totally responsible to the president and could not exert any
                    influence on the national scene. Fenno believes that no one has done more to make the cabinet an
                    American political institution than Eisenhower, who named a cabinet secretary and invested him with
                    the power to set up the agenda for each meeting. Poor cooperation from members who do not want their
                    departmental matters discussed by others has marred, however, the results the President hoped to
                    attain. Nevertheless, he has taken a significant step in the right direction.</p>
            <p>With <hi rend="i">The President's Cabinet</hi>, the author has made a scholarly, scientific,
                    and valuable contribution to American political literature.</p>

                    Council. This subcommittee, in its review of research and instruction on Russia in this country,
                    also stimulated the work which led to a companion volume, <hi rend="i">The Study of Russia in
                        American Education</hi>, edited by Professor Cyril E. Black, of <placeName>

                    </placeName> University, and Professor John M. Thompson, of Indiana University, published early in
                    1960 by the Indiana University Press. These two volumes together describe what is known and what <pb n="98" id="VAA4025-056-1-108"/> is being taught—or, alas, not known and not
                    taught—about Russia, and also make a number of pointed suggestions concerning what should
                    be done in the years ahead.</p>
            <p>The essays in <hi rend="i">American Research on Russia</hi> are not bibliographical articles, but
                    critical reviews of American scholarship in particular disciplines—history, economics,
                    political science, philosophy and religion, social relations, science, geography, literature,
                    linguistics, music, and architecture and minor arts—with emphasis on the quality of the
                    published work and, above all, on the kinds of subjects neglected thus far. The essays naturally
                    vary in quality, and one receives the impression that they often follow the tradition of American
                    book reviews in being too cautious and tender in comments upon the books and articles that have been
                    published.</p>
            <p>For this reviewer, among the most interesting and stimulating essays were Philip Mosely's
                    fine survey of "The Growth of Russian Studies" in this country since 1900 and the
                    essays on some of the disciplines in which little effective research has yet been done, especially
                    the one on social relations by Arthur S. Barron, that on science by John Turkevich, and that on
                    music by Robert M. Slusser. These latter essays are particularly clear in suggesting guidelines for
                    future research.</p>
            <p>If American scholars and administrators read this volume with care, the funds which will certainly be
                    invested in research on Russia will be wisely spent. The disciplines in which little research has
                    been done will remain weak unless those with most responsibility in our training programs direct
                    more funds and energy into these neglected fields. Errors in the next few years will lead to an
                    unfortunate lack of balance in Russian studies, a weakness which is already apparent and which will
                    become of especial significance as more and more attention is devoted to Russia at all levels of our
                    educational system.</p>

                    material for the past two decades added by Glenn S. Dumke. The new version is published as a single
                    volume with the title indicated at the heading of this review. Dr. Dumke was a student and ardent
                    admirer of the late Dr. Cleland, and the present volume shows evidence of skill and devoted care in
                    retouching the master's original work. Dumke states that except for occasional passages,
                    the first two chapters, the concluding chapter, and the bibliography the writing is that of Dr.
                    Cleland. The editor's major job has been, therefore, to reduce the two original volumes to
                    one.</p>
            <pb n="99" id="VAA4025-056-1-109"/>
            <p>Without disparagement of the new product, one wonders why this boiled-down version was considered
                    necessary. Certainly the original two-volume work is not lacking in either solid, worthwhile content
                    or stylistic charm. Actually, the word reduction is not so great as one might at first suspect. The
                    445-page new edition is set in smaller, more compact type than are the 692 pages contained in the
                    original two-volume work. Much of the condensation has taken the form of trimming Spanish regalia in
                    order to make room on the coach for such new riders as Richard M. Nixon, Earl Warren, William F.
                    Knowland, and Goodwin Knight.</p>
            <p>A distinguishing feature of the two-volume work was the author's frank appraisal of
                    personages and events in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>'s long and varied history. Fortunately this original flavor is retained in the
                    present version. The final chapter entitled "<placeName>

                    foregoing ones by its tender regard for Republican luminaries.</p>
            <p>The number of illustrations and maps have been reduced from a list of 34 items to 22. Only a couple
                    of contemporary scenes have been included in the new edition. As usual, the general make-up and
                    appearance of this Borzoi book meet the standard set by the publisher.</p>

            <p>It is not necessary to be a lumberman, an irrigation farmer, or a bird watcher to appreciate the
                    review of American forestry policy presented by Arthur H. Carhart. In fact, one already aware of the
                    role of the national forests in conserving timber, water, or wild life will find the consideration
                    given his special interest in The National Forests too cursory for satisfaction. In the same way,
                    the historian looking for intimate views of the makers of American forest policy will be
                    disappointed, for the glimpses one catches of James Wesley Powell, Gifford Pinchot, and Theodore
                    Roosevelt are too brief. This, in short, is not a book for the specialist unless he seeks to broaden
                    his vision—to see his particular interest in the general context of the forestry
                    movement.</p>
            <p>Qualified for his task by brief employment in the forest service and lifelong interest in and
                    contribution to the conservation movement, the author accepts the responsibility of acquainting the
                    American public with its increasingly valuable property, the national forests. He presents a broad,
                    well-balanced, and multi-dimensional picture of the forests and of the service which maintains them.
                    The primary, legally defined purposes of the national forests—preservation of timber
                    resources and protection of watersheds—receive emphasis. The inception and development of
                    national forestry policy is outlined; the sources of conflict between forestry policy and
                    profit-seeking interests are explained; the administrative organization which enables the United <pb n="100" id="VAA4025-056-1-110"/> States Forest Service to perform its diverse functions is
                    sketched. Of course, the outstanding floods and fires are considered along with modern methods of
                    preventing and combating them.</p>
            <p>The individual forests, however, are the principal subject of consideration. To Arthur Carhart each
                    forest has a distinct personality. Deriving its basic traits from geological and climatic
                    conditions, each has its typical plant and animal associations. The author successfully combines
                    description of the forests with description of the work of the service. His technique is to describe
                    a particular forest region and then to present a phase of the work of the service that is especially
                    important therein.</p>
            <p>Well-chosen pictures do much to help the reader visualize the distinctiveness of the individual
                    forests and the work of the forest service. The map of the regions, to which one is constantly
                    referred, would be more useful if it were larger and more detailed. Had it been a fold-out sheet or
                    an end paper it would have been much more readily accessible and immeasurably more useful.</p>
            <p>As the conservation movement receives increasing attention, this work should prove useful although it
                    is not a formal history of the movement and takes note of conservation's origins and
                    development only incidentally. It is a three-dimensional description of a national asset: nature,
                    the land and its products; the service which maintains and develops it; the time perspective through
                    which the land and its products have been developed by the men of the forest service.</p>

            <p>
               <hi rend="i">A Ticket to the Circus</hi>, by Charles Philip Fox, is a very interesting account of the
                    Great Ringling Circus' birth, reign, and decline. It is nonfiction, but if you are a circus
                    fan, circus enthusiast, or just a middle-aged person with the warm reminiscence of sawdust in your
                    veins, you will enjoy every word of the 184 pages. The author is director of the Circus Museum at
                    Bamboo, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>, so authentic newspapers are quoted and rare photographs are reproduced for the reader.</p>
            <p>The volume tells of the deveolpment of the Ringling Circus and of the era that was its heyday.
                    Outstanding sections include a Preface by Hester Ringling Sanford, a chapter by Alice Ringling
                    Coerper, and a chapter entitled "Circus Logistics," which was originally published
                    in <hi rend="i">Fortune magazine for July</hi>, 1947.</p>
            <p>This is the story of seven incredible brothers named Ringling, but it is also a story of the circus
                    itself. It is the story of a family born into poverty, but whose thoroughness of execution, honesty
                    of purpose, and devotion to an ideal resulted in the amassing of immense fortunes. Also, it is the
                    story of the one Ringling sister, Ida Ringling North. <pb n="101" id="VAA4025-056-1-111"/> Her sons,
                    John Ringling North and Henry Ringling North, have guided the Ringling Circus since 1937.</p>
            <p>The Ringling Circus has always been a fast-moving performance by the top stars and acts in the world.
                    To accomplish this feat and to give the audience a smooth-running show requires almost split-second
                    timing by the entire company. The book tells of the working menagerie, the ticket seller, the cook
                    house, the circus band, the "spec," the side show, the after show or concert, the
                    elephants and horses, the street parades, the winter quarters, and of all the departments working
                    together in the "back-yard" under the "Big Top." It ends with
                    the chapter, "The Tent is Folded." This chapter leaves the reader with the
                    question of whether the original Ringling Brothers would have favored a circus under the canvas or
                    whether they would have cut expenses to produce a circus under the sky.</p>

                    </placeName> Press, 1959. Pp. viii, 129. Index. $3.00.) This volume includes four
                    lectures given at the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> as part of the university's sesquicentennial observance of Lincoln's
                    birth. Professor Roy P. Basler deals principally with Lincoln as symbol and myth, as "An
                    Immortal Sign," the interpretation of which is varied, often ambiguous, and frequently more
                    a reflection of the popular image of America than of the real Lincoln. Basler indicates major
                    problems which arise from Lincoln myths and symbols that have developed. Professors T. Harry
                    Williams, David Donald, and Norman A. Graebner have much in common in what they say of Lincoln. To
                    Williams, Lincoln was a "Pragmatic Democrat"; to Donald, he was a "Whig
                    in the White House"; to Graebner, he was a "Conservative Statesman."
                    Basler is quite likely in basic agreement with much that these three lecturers say, but he and they
                    travel different paths in these lectures. Williams, Donald, and Graebner agree that Lincoln
                    distrusted doctrinaire minds such as possessed by abolitionists, that he had basic principles but
                    was not rigidly committed to any definite set of policies, that he was the Great Nationalist even
                    more than the Great Emancipator, and that he was essentially a conservative. These are thoughtful
                    essays in a broad historical context, interesting to scholars and general readers alike.</p>

                    volume records an unknown Frenchman's impressions of the American colonies as they were
                    when he made a tour of several months during 1777. The author stresses that he noted a spirit of
                    liberty and a tendency toward independence on the part of the American colonists, then in the midst
                    of the War for Independence. His observations indicate that he also perceived American distrust of
                    the French, and he expressed the view that Americans would never sincerely like the French (pp.
                    66-67). Professor Seeber appears to have done his editorial work with care. The account offers
                    observations which bear upon social and economic history as well as upon political and military
                    aspects of the American Revolution.</p>

                    interesting tale regarding Isaac Knight's captivity among the Indians of the Old Northwest.
                    According to the legend here recounted, the Knight family settled where <placeName>

                    The bulk of the story details his life among the redmen. This tale indicates the dreadful loss of
                    life among the Indians because of smallpox; it offers information about the fur trade and Indian
                    life generally; and it uses General Wayne's campaign of 1794 to illustrate the costly
                    conflict between the whites and Indians. One might easily question various details and aspects of
                    this story, but here is a legend of Indian captivity which should be of interest to junior high
                    school students of Indiana history. Experiences such as those McCutchan describes were a serious
