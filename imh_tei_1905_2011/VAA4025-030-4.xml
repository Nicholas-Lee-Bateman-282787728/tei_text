            <p>A canal is an artificial watercourse used as a transportation route. By locks it can be made, if desired or
          necessary, to step up or step down so as to cross ridges or water-sheds and other barriers between the sources
          of streams. Thus the <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Wabash</region>
               </placeName> and <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Erie</settlement>
               </placeName> Canal was planned as a highway of commerce to traverse the valleys of the Maumee and the <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Wabash</region>
               </placeName> and to cross the portage separating their drainage areas.</p>
            <p>It was promulgated and constructed under the provisions of an act passed by Congress on May 27, 1827. By this
          act Indiana was given every alternate section of land, with a few exceptions, five miles back on each side of
          the proposed line of the canal—practically 3200 acres for every mile of the route. The canal was
          planned at that time to extend from opposite the mouth of the <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
               </placeName> River to the falls of the Maumee River. To obtain this grant work had to commence by March 2,
          1832. Accordingly, on February 22, anniversary of the birth of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
               </placeName> who had many years previously suggested such a waterway, the ground was broken with appropriate
          ceremonies.</p>
            <p>When first proposed it was thought the entire line would lie within the boundaries of Indiana, but as the
          surveyors began laying out the route they ascertained that the Maumee River was not navigable, nor was it
          practicable to make it so. Therefore, the line of construction was planned so as to connect with Maumee Bay,
          an arm of Lake <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Erie</settlement>
               </placeName>. Then Congress authorized the state of Indiana to convey that part of the donated lands lying
          beyond her territorial limits to the state of <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>. This was done on February 1,1834, by a joint resolution of the branches of the Indiana
          Legislature.</p>

               </placeName> River to the forks of the <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Wabash</region>
               </placeName> River, was opened. In 1835 a bill passed the Indiana Legislature to extend the canal from the
          mouth of <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
               </placeName> River to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
               </placeName>, an estimated distance of fourteen miles and twenty-nine chains, and appropriated for that
          purpose $227,000.</p>
            <p>In 1836 the canal was built through <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Wabash County</region>
               </placeName> but no water was turned in until ten months later when the feeder at Lagro was tapped. During
          this long period of waiting the broad, level bottom of the canal was occasionally used as a driving course.
          According to the program for the opening of this section the freight boat <hi rend="i">Indiana</hi> was to
          make the initial trip to <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Wabash</region>
               </placeName> on July 4, 1837. Upon its arrival the large crowd that had assembled formed a parade and marched
          to Treaty Grounds where a feast was partaken of and speeches made. The day's celebration was closed
          by a dance up town in the evening.</p>
            <p>In the latter part of the year 1837, the section between <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Wabash</region>
               </placeName> and <placeName>
                  <country reg="pe">Peru</country>
               </placeName> was opened. The digging of the channel was completed to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
               </placeName> in the fall of 1838, too late to undertake a regular opening. The January freshet that followed
          created a wide breach at Bull Creek, the repair of which was not completed until about the beginning of April.
          Navigation was formally opened to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
               </placeName> on April 20, 1839.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In November, 1839, it was estimated that the eastern end of the canal would be completed to the state line by
          the first of June, and the western section to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
               </placeName> by the first of October (1840).<hi rend="sup">2</hi> This turned out to be correct, for in the
          fall of 1840 the channel was completed to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
               </placeName> and several trips were made by boats between <placeName>

            <p>During the season the bank at Birmingham Bluff for a distance of more than a mile, was protected by a layer

               </placeName> River until Carrollton was reached where it crossed to the east side. The towing horses were
          transported across the river on a ferry boat at first, but later on a towpath bridge, the construction of
          which was completed October 1, 1844.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> By means of a lock here the boats were lowered to
          the surface level of the river or lifted to the canal's elevation—according to the
          direction going. The crossing was possible because the stream was placid here, due to the backwater from the <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Delphi</settlement>
               </placeName> or <placeName>

          water eight feet in the pool of the river at the point of crossing, and to all appearances, during normal
          stages, there was no current. In crossing the river the boats were floated upon the quiet waters of the stream
          itself for a short distance and then entered the canal's channel, which, for two and one-half miles,
          was invisible—only the towpath showing. The channel, the west bank and the ground between it and
          the river proper were submerged by the backwater from the dam, making a single wide stream or body of
            water.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> About one and one-half miles above the dam there was a guard lock where the
          canal left the river and the low ground that paralleled it on the west, and proceeded on southward between its
          two banks, both now visible.</p>

              above the crest of the water, afforded a footing for the towing horses to draw the boats which followed
              the unseen channel. The dam was blown out with dynamite in 1882.</p>

            <p>The boating season opened about March 1, and closed about November 1, annually. The speed of the boats was
          from three to six miles per hour, some of the packets making even as much as eight miles. The freight boats
          never did better than three miles. The boats were drawn by from two to six horses or mules, hitched tandem. In

            <p>The Hoagland Mill stood on the west bank of the canal, like the other industries, but farther down, at the
          foot of Green Street. Its power was generated by a sixteen-foot wheel. In 1865 it was purchased by John Ewry.
          Within a short time Edward Robeson, whose father operated a woolen mill near Monitor, became a partner. At
          this time (1867) the firm consisted of John Ewry, Edward Robeson and Jacob Ewry. By 1871 the firm was known as
          J. Ewry and Co., Robeson having withdrawn. It was operated by the Ewrys until about 1875 or 1876 when it was
          destroyed by fire during the burning of the Eagle Distillery which stood less than two blocks southeast of it.</p>
            <p>The main approach to all these industries on the canal in the southern part of the city was, by crossing the
          canal on a bridge at South Street and proceeding south on the towpath. There was another bridge at Green
          Street, opposite the Hoagland Mill, but it was a crude affair compared to the well built, firm structures at
          South, Main and <placeName>

            <p>About 1875, when the canal ceased to be operated as a transportation unit, the power consumers of each

          crippled the canal that navigation was never resumed. For many years following this flood, there could be seen
          here and there along the course of the canal, stranded boats rotting in the mud where the receding waters had
          deposited them, like unto the animal carcases which strewed the routes across the great arid plains of the far
          West in an earlier day. By court order, the canal line was sold on February 12, 1876. The section in <placeName>

               </placeName> Valley. Along its course there sprang up as if by magic, trading and industrial centers which
          were supported by the oncoming hordes of colonists that kept penetrating deeper and deeper into the wilderness
          country that stretched away to the east and to the west of its line of passage. But even in its most
          prosperous times the great venture was not a financial success, the upkeep being a tremendous drain. The
          average yearly cost for repairs was $262 per mile, or a total yearly cost of about
            $120,000.<hi rend="sup">35</hi> Covering the whole period of its operation, from the time of its
          beginning to the time of its abandonment, the tolls did not equal the cost of repairs. Of the lands donated by
          the government, more than 2,000,000 acres, sufficient were sold to realize $1,500,000, providing a
          fairly steady income for several years. When the sales slackened the financial condition became acute.<hi rend="sup">36</hi> All this government land was practically squandered on a failing enterprise. The

            <p>Dr. Billings was a man who, from humble beginnings, attained a position of eminence and great honor, and who
          for fifty years devoted his life to the good of mankind. He was born April 12, 1838, near Allensville, <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Switzerland County</region>
               </placeName>, Indiana. His father was James Billings of Saratoga, <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
               </placeName>. His mother was Abby (Shaw) Billings of Raynham, <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
               </placeName>. The parents were married July 21, 1835.</p>
            <p>The elder Billings was possessed of the wanderlust. When John was but two or three years old, the family
          moved back east, living successively in <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>, <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
               </placeName> and <placeName>
                  <country reg="riu">Rhode Island</country>
               </placeName>. They completed the circuit in six years, returning to Allensville, Indiana, when John was about
          ten. Dr. Billings told an astounding tale of his doings while away from Indiana. He declared that before he
          was eight years old, he had read the <hi rend="i">Bible</hi> through verse by verse, in addition to the
          following books: <hi rend="i">Robinson Crusoe, Pilgrims Progress, The Deer Slayer, The Pathfinder, Harry and
            Lucy, Marco Paul in the Forests of <placeName>
                     <region type="state" reg="meu">Maine</region>
                  </placeName>, Jock O'the Mill</hi>, and <hi rend="i">Plutarchs Lives</hi>. He certainly was a
          precocious lad.</p>
            <p>Dr. Philander Sage who lived nearby, told me many things about Dr. Billings. I remember this one. He was
          invited by other boys of the neighborhood to go with them to pilfer some melons and other fruit from the
          gardens of their neighbors; he declined to be one of the party. Misjudging him, the boys called him
          "Lazy John."</p>
            <p>He did not seek, or seem to care for the companionship of other boys. He loved books, and his pleasure and
          recreation consisted in reading them. With the help of a clergyman in the village he learned Latin. Now it was
          that he developed a desire to go to college. He proposed to surrender his share in the estate, if his father
          would help him through college. He procured the necessary books, and studied one year. At the age of fourteen,
          he entered the sub-freshman class of Miami University at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Oxford</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, in 1852. Five years later,
          he received the degree of B.A. ranking second in his class. Before he graduated his parents moved to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Oxford</settlement>
               </placeName> and John gave up "bachelors' hall" to live with them. It was said of
          John's mother that "she was a persistent reader of all kinds of literature, <pb n="326" id="VAA4025-030-4-018"/> that she had a <hi rend="i">compelling</hi> eye, that she knew what she
          wanted—and got it." Many of her traits were reflected in her son.</p>
            <p>John planned to study medicine, but had to wait a year until he had earned money enough for the medical
          school. He spent the summer of 1857 travelling with an itinerant showman, who had a collection of lantern
          slides, and needed someone to give the lectures. John did this satisfactorily. By this means and by tutoring,
          he earned money enough to enter the Medical College of <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName> at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
               </placeName> in the fall of 1858. Then followed two of the most exacting and exhausting years of his life.
          With dire poverty facing him, he had to practice the severest economy. During one winter he lived on
          seventy-five cents a week, subsisting chiefly on milk and eggs. The hospital was his home, and he cared for
          the college dissecting room. In 1860 he took his degree. The subject of his graduation thesis was
          "The Surgical Treatment of Epilepsy." He had a great deal of trouble collecting the data
          needed for this work. Because of the poor arrangement of the books in most of the libraries he visited, he
          spent six months in getting the desired information. When the college term opened in the fall of 1860 he was
          appointed demonstrator of anatomy and served throughout the term. When the Civil War came on, he determined to
          join the medical corps, and went to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
               </placeName> in September, 1861. Pending the result of his examination, he became a contract-surgeon, and was
          detailed to go to the Union Hotel Hospital in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Georgetown</settlement>
               </placeName>, D. C. He was commissioned first lieutenant and assistant surgeon on April 16, 1862. It was while
          stationed at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Georgetown</settlement>
               </placeName> that he met Miss Katharine Mary Stevens. They were married on September 3,1862. The young surgeon
          was ordered to report for duty in the West <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
               </placeName> Hospital in August of 1862. All hospitals in the east were crowded with wounded men, due to the
          heavy fighting of the spring and summer months of 1862. The duties at this station lasted to April 1, 1863,
          when Dr. Billings was ordered to report to the Medical Director of the Army of the Potomac. For nearly all of
          the rest of the year, he was on active field duty. Chancellorsville was fought during the first week of May,
          and here he had his first experience of field surgery when he operated under fire just back of the lines.</p>

          hospital of the Second Division of the Fifth Army Corps. He worked all night, and early the next morning moved
          the hospital about one mile to the rear, where he operated all day. When the Division moved on July 5, he was
          left in charge of the hospital. The next day he wrote to Mrs. Billings: <quote rend="blockquote">I am utterly
            exhausted, mentally and physically. I have been operating night and day, and am still hard at work. I have
            been left in charge of 700 wounded, and have got my hands full. Our division lost terribly, over 30 per cent
            were killed and wounded. I had my left ear just touched with a ball, and Dick's mane was cut in two

            <p>After spending several weeks at home in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Georgetown</settlement>

                  <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
               </placeName>, and was then again ordered to the Army of the Potomac. It was in the latter part of March, 1864,
          that he went on active field duty once more. During the next four months he lived through the battles of the
          Wilderness, Cold Harbor, and <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Petersburg</settlement>
               </placeName>. By July a partial paralysis of his left leg made further field service impossible, and he was
          granted sick leave on July 26. He went to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
               </placeName>, secured an extension of his leave, and on August 22 was relieved from field duty and detailed to

               </placeName> with the Medical Director of the Army of the Potomac. On December 27, 1864, he was transferred to
          the Office of the Surgeon General, where he remained until his retirement thirty-one years later.</p>
            <p>It was the great difficulty which he had himself experienced in collecting data for his graduation thesis,
          that caused him to establish for American physicians a medical library, and, together with this, prepare a
          comprehensive catalogue and index. His opportunity came when he was in charge of the Surgeon
          General's Library and he devoted much time to its development. A sum of $80,000 was made
          available, and using <pb n="328" id="VAA4025-030-4-020"/> this to the best advantage, he increased the library
          from 600 entries in 1865 to more than 50,000 by 1873. In 1880 Congress provided for printing his monumental
          work, the <hi rend="i">Index Catalogue</hi>, in which he was assisted by Dr. Robert Fletcher. In 1879,
          Billings and Fletcher published the <hi rend="i">Index Medicus</hi>, a monthly guide to current medical
          literature. Dr. William H. Welch says that "the Index Catalogue is probably the most important
          contribution yet made to American medicine." Another writer says that the "three great
          things in the life of Dr. Billings, after the war were the development of the Surgeon General's
          Library and its catalogue, the planning of the Johns Hopkins Hospital and the Directorship of the <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
               </placeName> Public Library."</p>
            <p>Still another great thing should go to the credit of Dr. Billings—<hi rend="i">sanitation</hi>.
          Not only is this true in connection with the construction of hospitals, but in relation to general sanitation
          as well. He contributed more to the literature of sanitation, than to any other subject. His motto was, <hi rend="i">"prevent</hi> sickness, rather than <hi rend="i">cure</hi> disease." In March
          1875, with four other distinguished physicians he was selected by the trustees of the Johns Hopkins Hospital
          to submit designs for the hospital they were planning to erect, from funds left them by the <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
               </placeName> merchant who died December 24,1873. Dr. Billings' suggestions were deemed best, and for
          the next thirteen years he served as adviser to the trustees. He made a trip to Europe in their behalf,
          inspecting hospitals in <placeName>
                  <country reg="enk">England</country>
               </placeName> and on the Continent, in quest of the newest ideas in hospital construction. The physical
          arrangements of the new hospital were due almost entirely to him. At the Billings' Memorial Meeting
          held at the hospital on May 26, 1913, Dr. Henry M. Hurd said that "these plans influenced hospitals
          in a way unparalleled in the history of hospital construction, and gave a tremendous impetus to better
          hospitals by directing the attention of medical men, sanitarians, and others to the absolute necessity of
          certain great essentials, viz. more perfect ventilation and heating, and the prevention of
          contagion." In 1886, I attended a medical meeting in Ford's Theater Building. Leading the
          discussion of a disease then prevalent in <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
               </placeName> was Dr. Billings, so let's have a look at the man. He was large, had a fine intellectual
          face, and a booming voice. His manner in speaking was animated and intensely earnest. He drove every word deep
          into <pb n="329" id="VAA4025-030-4-021"/> the minds of his listeners. I was so impressed with his speech that
          now, after the lapse of forty-eight years, I still remember the subject under discussion—<hi rend="i">Anthrax</hi>.</p>
            <p>Dr. Billings was under my observation from 1890 until his retirement from the Army in 1895. I never saw as
          busy a man as he. When he was not classifying books in the Surgeon General's Library, he was
          lecturing at Johns Hopkins University, or writing articles for medical journals. Time was more precious to him
          than gold. While he won high praise for the part he took in the construction of the Johns Hopkins Hospital,
          equal praise is due him for helping create the staff of medical professors for the University, composed as it
          was of such men as Osler, Welch, and other brilliant teachers. For fifty years its high standard has been
          maintained, and today no medical school in the country ranks higher. Before the close of his army life, many
          honors were bestowed on Dr. Billings. In August 1881 he was invited to give an address before the
          International Medical Congress to be held in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
               </placeName>. He was the first American physician to be so honored, and his address on Our Medical Literature
          was received with great enthusiasm. The <hi rend="i">Lancet</hi> described him as "tall and largely
          built," a man of "commanding presence, with a flow of wholesome English, ready wit and
          humor." In 1884 he went abroad to receive the degree of LL.D. at the celebration of the 300th
          anniversary of the University of Edinburgh. He sailed again in June 1889 to receive the degree of D.C.L. at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Oxford</settlement>
               </placeName>. In 1892 he was called to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Dublin</settlement>
               </placeName> to receive the honorary degree of M.D. at the <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Dublin</settlement>
               </placeName> University tercentenary celebration, and to be made honorary fellow of the Royal College of
          Surgeons of <placeName>
                  <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>
               </placeName>.</p>
            <p>When he gave up his work at the National Adademy of Science in 1895, he received from physicians of Great
          Britain and America, at a dinner given in his honor, a silver box containing a check for $10,000 as
          a material expression of gratitude for the labor-saving value of his catalogue. A good many things happened to
          Dr. Billings in the year 1895. He was retired from the Army on October 1, with the rank of Lieut. Colonel and
          Deputy Surgeon General. He moved to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
               </placeName> in October, 1895, where he had been lecturing in the Medical University for several years. In
          December 1895 he was called to <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
               </placeName> to assume the directorship of the New <pb n="330" id="VAA4025-030-4-022"/> York Public Library,
          which had recently been created by the consolidation of the Astor, Lenox and Tilden libraries. The work to be
          done was immense including the erecting of a new building. Dr. Billings had the able assistance of Andrew
          Carnegie who gave $5,000,000 to be used in the construction of forty branch library buildings in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">New York City</settlement>
               </placeName>. After fifteen years of hard work, Dr. Billings had the satisfaction of knowing that he was the
          director of one of the largest and best arranged libraries in the world.</p>
            <p>In 1901-2, Dr. Billings was actively engaged with Dr. Daniel C. Gilman in the establishment and incorporation
          of the Carnegie Institution of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
               </placeName>, D. C. He became chairman of the board of trustees in 1903, a position he held until his death.
          Other trustees with whom he served were ex-presidents <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
               </placeName> and Harrison, and ex-Secretary of State Elihu Root. All will admit that Dr. Billings had
          distinguished associates.</p>
            <p>His great ability and worth were recognized by such master minds as Elihu Root and Andrew Carnegie. Many
          libraries were built with the latter's money on the advice of Dr. Billings. This was a God-send to
          many small and poor towns like <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
               </placeName>, Indiana. On the motto of Lea, publisher of medical books, <hi rend="i">"quae prosunt
            omnibus,"</hi> he "hewed to the line."</p>
            <p>Dr. John Shaw Billings passed to the greater life on March 11, 1913. The funeral services were held in St.
          John's Church, <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Georgetown</settlement>
               </placeName>, D. C., where he had been married fifty-one years before. He was buried with military honors at
          Arlington on the morning of Friday, March 14, 1913.</p>

            <p>A study of the routes of the old post roads as established by Congress through southern Indiana up to 1825
          will shed a considerable amount of light on the course taken by pioneer travel during the period when this
          part of the state was being colonized by immigrants from the South and the East.</p>
            <p>To the year 1805, only three post offices<hi rend="sup">1</hi> had been established in that part of the
          Indiana Territory which now corresponds to the state. However, during the next twenty years, Congress
          established fifty-seven different post routes which, served by post riders on horseback carrying the mail in
          saddlebags and by two and four-horse stages and wagons, furnished the transportation for the postal service
          until the coming of the railroads.</p>
            <p>The Eleventh Congress, on April 28, 1810, approved three routes for Indiana: one from <placeName>

          roads in southern Indiana, however, remained practically unchanged from 1825 until the mail was carried by
          railroads. The Report of the Postmaster General for 1825 informed the country that "half of the
          intelligence of the country is still carried in saddle bags." It is evident from this statement that
          a good many of these routes were served on horseback, although from this time on more and more of the mail was
          carried by two or four-horse stages which also carried passengers on their weekly or semi-weekly trips. As
          late as 1834, only one route, that from New <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
               </placeName> to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
               </placeName>, was served with daily mail. The primary avenue for mail, especially mail coming from the East,
          for all southern Indiana in the early days was, of course, the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>. Mail was
          brought to the many landings by the mail boats and thence inland over the post routes to the proper
          destinations, the small settlements of early Hoosier pioneers.</p>

            <p>The Negro Exodus from the South in 1879 was really an emigration movement. <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
               </placeName> was the "Canaan" for which most of the blacks were bound but some of them found
          their way to older states. The Negro emigrants came chiefly from <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>, <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>, <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>, and <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
               </placeName>. In time, however, the movement spread to the Atlantic states of the South affecting the colored
          people of <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
               </placeName>, the Carolinas, and <placeName>
                  <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
               </placeName>. The <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
               </placeName> migration was diverted into Indiana which gave rise to a charge that the Republican party was
          importing colored voters for the purpose of changing the political complexion of the state from Democratic to
          Republican.</p>
            <p>The <placeName>
                  <country reg="-us">United States</country>
               </placeName> Senate appointed a committee of investigation. The testimony of persons examined filled nearly
          1700 printed pages. All the members of the committee were Democrats save two. The majority report, supported
          by the Democratic members, held that Republicans had "colonized" Indiana for political
            purposes.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> The two Republican members drew up a minority report in which their party was
          absolved from all connection with the northward movement of southern Negroes. Three reasons were given for the
          migration: (1) A sense of personal insecurity attending the reversion of the South to Democratic rule, and
          political discontent among the blacks resulting from disfranchisement. (2) Economic discontent resulting from
          low prices for cotton and the extent of debt-servitude which grew out of the crop lien system. (3) Attractive
          propaganda consisting in part of circulars advertising the holdings of certain land-grant railroads and in
          part of excitement worked up by local leaders, who, in some cases at least, seem to have had selfish ends to
          serve.</p>

          who, in the spring of 1879, began to hold meetings in colored churches and elsewhere. In these meetings, the

          formerly been a political worker in Indiana, was a clerk in the Treasury Department. Mendenhall is reported to
          have said: "Gentlemen, there are a great many colored people going to <placeName>

          people to distinguish between what the circulars told them and what Perry actually said, but it is very likely
          that he indorsed the printed word. There is no lack of evidence that he did. It was generally understood that
          marvelous wages ranging from $1.50 to $2 a day, and $5 and $6
          during the harvest season, were being paid in Indiana. When labor was contracted for by the year the current
          rate was understood to be $15 or $20 per month, in addition to a dwelling house, garden,
          plenty of fire wood and a cow to milk. Some of the colored people believed that after they got to <placeName>

          receiving a letter from Mendenhall suggesting the political value of colored voters who might be brought to
          Indiana. He then said: "Every one who had any interest in the management of the party in the state
          advised against it."<hi rend="sup">41</hi> Mr. New declared, "We were opposed to it because
          we knew that, as a matter of fact, the hue and cry that would be raised against us, and the clamor that it
          would get us, would do us more injury as a party, tenfold, than any accession we could possible
          gain… by the influx of colored population."<hi rend="sup">42</hi> Mendenhall's
          testimony is corroborative. He declared that Dudley wrote "that if employment could be got for them
          he would be glad to see them come into the state, but the Republicans as a party could have nothing to do with
          it." When asked the question, "DO you know of any movement on the part of active Republicans
          to colonize these Negroes for political purposes," he replied: "No, sir, I never heard of
            any."<hi rend="sup">43</hi> According to Dudley, Mendenhall was the only person who ever applied to
          him for money for such a purpose,<hi rend="sup">44</hi> and the leaders of the Central Committee were
          unanimous in declaring that neither the Committee nor any of its members as individuals had any part in
          raising money for the purpose of bringing Negroes into the state.<hi rend="sup">45</hi> It need not
          necessarily be assumed that they spoke the truth, but the evidence proves no practical or effective connection

              $1000 to go in his stead but when I said I'd go, he decided he would not pay that
              much. "Well you don't have to. Just go yourself," I said.</p>

            <p>The veteran then related, with a chuckle, that the young soldier's father gave him $500
          and a fine watch to take the son's place. As the service was easy and required only twenty-eight
          days, O'Day felt that he had made a good bargain, especially since he was able, upon his return, to
          sell the watch back to the owner for $100. The young recruit tried to convince Tommy O'Day
          that he had been paid to serve for the five year period of enlistment. The contract was taken to the Mayor of
          the city and then to the Governor of the province who decided that the obligation had been met by the service
          already performed.</p>
            <p>O'Day recalled that a private was paid a shilling a day when he was in the service out of which he
          must provide for himself. This left him only eight cents for spending money. If a soldier lost a spur, a belt,
          or any other article he had to pay for it and his pay was accordingly cut two cents. Drinking was severely
          punished. First offense meant twenty-eight days in the guard house; the second, meant a regimental court
          martial; the third, twenty lashes with a "cat 0' nine tails" and two years
          imprisonment. "For all that," the Irish soldier added, "there was a lot of
          drinking, but they were ‘sly’ about getting caught."</p>

               </placeName>'s announcement, shortly before this incident occurred, that he intended to withdraw from
          the Senate had created a popular demand for his appearance in different sections of the country as a prelude
          to his nomination as the Whig candidate for the Presidency. Such a nomination his host of admirers considered
          a matter of justice to him, inasmuch as he had loyally supported William Henry Harrison in 1840 despite the
          defeat he had received in the Whig National Convention at the hands of the old hero of <placeName>

               </placeName> and force him to express himself on the slavery question. The method they devised was the

          sense of political animosity or by real convictions is a matter of conjecture with a mixture of motives
          undoubtedly explaining the lengthy list of signatures. The existence of such a document seems to have been

                  <region type="county">Clay</region>
               </placeName> to begin his remarks with the hope that "Mr. Mendenhall may be treated with the greatest
          forbearance and respect."<hi rend="sup">7</hi> He continued declaring that the petition had
          elicitated no disagreeable emotion on his part and that he was glad to have it presented at a time when such a
          vast assemblage could hear it. This assertion was contradicted by a later remark when he complained that he
          did not see why the petitioners should have picked this time when they could have presented their request at
          his home at Ashland any time within the past twenty-five or thirty years. That he considered it a breach of
          hospitality and etiquette as well as a personal affront was likewise intimated by his asking Mr. Mendenhall
          how he should like to reverse conditions and have <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Clay</region>
               </placeName> place him in such a position were he his guest in <placeName>

               </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Mr. Clay then attempted to justify his position by the laws of his state which permitted slavery, declaring
          that "Until the law is repealed, we must be excused for asserting the rights—aye, the
          property in slaves which it sanctions, authorizes and vindicates." He then tried to explain away the
          importance of the large numbers of petitioners, many of whom he spoke of as "worthy, amicable and
          humane persons, who by erroneous representations," had been "induced inconsiderately to
          affix their signatures to this petition," persons whom he knew would later "deeply regret
          it." Others were free blacks <list type="footnotes">

          while the large portion of them, he intimated, were merely his political opponents. That he should have
          entirely ignored those among the petitioners who were entirely sincere in their desire to know his stand on
          the vital issue of slavery was a grave omission.</p>
            <p>Turning to the foundation of the appeal, the Declaration of Independence, he justified his position by
          stating that among the delegates who adopted that document were many from states where slavery existed and
          they certainly were not calling for its abolition by signing the Declaration. Furthermore, he expressed the
          belief that "in no society that ever did exist, or ever shall be formed, was or can the equality
          asserted among the members of the human race, be practically enforced and carried out." To
          demonstrate this he called attention to the fact that there would always be minors, women, insane persons,
          culprits and transient sojourners who could not be accorded equal rights. He ended this portion of his reply
          with the bold assertion that "if the doctrines of ultra political abolitionists had been seriously
          promulgated at the epoch of our Revolution, our glorious Independence would never have been
          achieved—never, never."</p>
            <p>As to his personal attitude towards slavery, he considered it a great evil which he deeply regretted had been
          inheritod by the people of his day. He stated that it was his wish that every slave could be sent back to his
          native country. But the evils of slavery, were, in his estimation, "nothing in comparison with the
          far greater evils which would inevitable flow from a sudden, general, and indiscriminate
          emancipation" with its attendant intermarriage and the possible subjugation of the whites by the
          blacks.</p>
            <p>
               <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Clay</region>
               </placeName> then declared that his own slaves would suffer rather than benefit from emancipation inasmuch as
          some of them were incapacitated to earn their own living and were therefore a "heavy charge"
          upon their master; some were helpless infants "with or without improvident mothers," and
          still others "would not accept their freedom" if he were to offer it to them. Then the
          speaker's real feelings came to the surface and he spoke to the leader of the petitioning body,
          saying: "Excuse me, Mr. Mendenhall, for my saying that my slaves are as well fed and clad, look as
          sleek and hearty; and <pb n="358" id="VAA4025-030-4-050"/> are quite as civil and respectful in their
          demeanor, and as little disposed to wound the feelings of any one, as you are."</p>
            <p>This latter somewhat derogatory remark was linked with an obvious bid for the <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
               </placeName> vote of the community when <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Clay</region>
               </placeName> recommended that Mendenhall imitate the example of the Society of Friends<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
          which agreed with him in principle, but whose tactics consisted of peace and persuasion rather than blood,
          revolution and disunion. The strange coincidence in the matter was the fact that Mendenhall himself was a <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
               </placeName>. <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Clay</region>
               </placeName> was anxious to correct the impression which he felt must exist in the minds of some of his
          listeners that he had no dealings with abolitionists, a fact which he vehemently denied although his friends
          among that group were not "monomaniacs who surrendering themselves to a single idea, look altogether
          to the black side of human life," ignoring the evils to be corrected among the whites.</p>
            <p>The great Whig leader of the occasion then attempted to retaliate against the petitioners by making his
          demands practical. He therefore asked Mendenhall if he and his friends would be willing to reimburse him in
          case he did decide to free his slaves which he evaluated at a total of some $15,000. It was a
          clever move and his strategy did not pass unnoticed by interested listeners among the crowd. In conclusion, <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Clay</region>
               </placeName> gave some politically unwise advice to Mendenhall suggesting that he should attend to his own
          affairs, limiting his "benevolent exertions" to his own neighborhood where he would find
          "ample scope for the exercise of [his] charities."</p>
            <p>"The speech was received by the crowd as a masterpiece," according to <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Clay</region>
               </placeName>'s grandson.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> This opinion is born out by Schurz, who declares that
          "The assembled multitude was lost in admiration."<hi rend="sup">10</hi> But the sequel was

                  <region type="county">Clay</region>
               </placeName>. As Professor Paxson has pointed out, this meeting was an outstanding demonstration of the fact
          that "the settlers whom the North contributed to the Old Northwest were refusing to mix with those
          who derived their ideals from the South."<hi rend="sup">11</hi>

            <p>On December 11, 1815, the territorial Legislature of Indiana petitioned for admission into the Union. On
          December 11, 1816, the President approved the bill which made Indiana the nineteenth state. The most important
          step in the whole process was the holding of a Constitutional Convention at Corydon in June, 1816, and the
          framing of a state constitution. As the convention finished its work, it directed the making of official
          copies of the constitution in the following resolution: <quote rend="blockquote">
                  <p>Resolved, that there shall be two complete copies of the Constitution of Indiana, one of which shall be
              lodged with the president of the convention, to be kept by him until the meeting of the first general
              assembly, at which time the constitution shall be laid before them, and to be disposed of in such manner
              as they may direct.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </p>
               </quote>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the convention ordered two copies to be written out, one of which was to be given to the President of
          the Convention, Jonathan Jennings. At the first session of the General Assembly the President of the
          Convention, who, as it happened, became also the first governor, was to give the copy entrusted to him to the
          General Assembly. On November 11, 1816, the Governor delivered the copy of the Constitution in his possession
          to the State Senate, which copy was deposited with the Secretary of State.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Constitutional Convention did not provide for the disposal of the other copy, and the writer has found no
          direct reference to it except in the <hi rend="i">Journals</hi> of the House and Senate for the session of
            1826-27.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> In that session the Speaker laid before the House the following communication

              well by the future antiquarian, as by a grateful posterity. Viewing the subject in this light, I have, as
              a small tribute of respect for, and gratitude towards the people and government of my adopted state, used
              this means of preserving from injury and decay, the original evidences of the independence of our state,
              and they are respectfully presented to the view of each branch of the Legislature, under the impression
              that their preservation is interesting to all the representatives of the people, and especially to those
              who were members of the body who originated them.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

            <p>A reasonable inference from these letters of Secretary of State Wick is that both of the original official
          manuscripts had been brought from Corydon to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
               </placeName> in 1826, when the capital had been moved, that they were both in his possession in 1826, and that
          he had caused both of them to be "handsomely bound in morocco and gilt." He apparently
          showed one of them to the Senate and the other to the House.</p>
            <p>There is now in the office of the Secretary of State at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
               </placeName> only one manuscript copy of the Constitution of 1816. It presumably is the copy ordered by the
          Convention to be given to Jonathan Jennings and by him given to the Senate, and by the Senate in turn given to
          the Secretary of State. The history of the other copy, save for the pride of Mr. Wick in both copies recorded
          in the <hi rend="i">Journals</hi>, is wholly lost in darkness.</p>
            <p>However, the provision which the convention made for printing the Constitution leads one to wonder whether
          the second copy was not used for that purpose. It providently recommended "to the early attention of
          the first General Assembly of the State of Indiana, the necessity of making an appropriation to pay for the
          printing of the Journals of the Convention and the Constitution of the state.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> It further
          provided "that the committee appointed to contract for printing the <hi rend="i">Constitution</hi>
          and <hi rend="i">Journals</hi> of this convention, be authorized to have them, when printed stitched and
          forwarded to the several counties," specifying that eleven copies should be given to each member of
          the convention, and two copies to each of the secretaries.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> It also directed the president
          of the Convention to forward one printed copy of the Constitution to the President of the <placeName>

            <p>Three different printings of the Constitution dated 1816 are known: one printed in <placeName>

               </placeName>, by <placeName>

               </placeName>, D. C., by William A. Davis by order of the House of Representatives of the <placeName>
                  <country reg="-us">United States</country>
               </placeName>; and one printed by Elihu Stout at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
               </placeName>. All are excessively rare items today among book dealers. The first of the three is undoubtedly
          the one contracted for by the committee appointed by the Convention for that purpose, for the first General
          Assembly of the State appropriated two hundred dollars to pay Mann <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
               </placeName> for printing the <hi rend="i">Journals</hi> and the <hi rend="i">Constitution</hi>. The reprints
          of the Constitution in the volume entitled <hi rend="i">Acts of 1819</hi> and in the <hi rend="i">Revision</hi> of 1824, though differing in numerous minutiae from these 1816 editions, seem to belong to the
          same "family."</p>
            <p>As one of the official copies of the Constitution was given to Jennings, it seems likely that the other was
          used by the committee appointed to supervise the printing of it. Whether this was the case or not, both copies
          were in the possession of William W. Wick, Secretary of State, in 1826. One has been retained in the office of
          the Secretary of State ever since and the other disappeared at some time earlier than the memory of anyone
          known by the author. There is, to be sure, a tradition, but no direct evidence, that it was in the <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Harrison County</region>
               </placeName> Courthouse at Corydon, the old State House, about thirty or forty years ago. Since it was in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
               </placeName> in 1826, there seems to be little probability of its reappearance at Corydon later.</p>
            <p>This missing copy of the enrolled Constitution of 1816 turned up in 1932 in the hands of a dealer in
          historical manuscripts. It was eventually purchased by the Indiana Historical <list type="footnotes">

               <pb n="363" id="VAA4025-030-4-055"/> Society for the William Henry Smith Memorial Library, bequeathed to the
          Society by the late Delavan Smith. A comparison of it with the copy in the office of the Secretary of State
          left no doubt of its authenticity. Materials, general characteristics of the handwriting, binding, and
          signatures of the delegates and officers of the Convention are practically identical. Both documents contain
          the same material, including preliminary matter as well as the Constitution itself.</p>
            <p>The two manuscripts, however, show interesting variations. Capitalization agrees as consistently as could be
          expected. In manuscripts of that time and place it is often difficult and sometimes impossible, to tell
          whether a letter is capitalized or not. There appear to be differences in capitalization in a number of words,
          but the two manuscripts do not differ in this respect from each other more than each scribe differed in the
          capitalization of the same word in different places.</p>
            <p>Punctuation in Indiana in those days was a most inexact, not to say inexplicable art. Commas and dashes came
          so thick and fast that they actually interrupted the sense. It is only natural that punctuation marks and
          marks which look like punctuation marks, but may not have been, differ throughout the two manuscripts. Such
          differences, of course, must be ignored.</p>
            <p>The mistakes existing in the official copy of Indiana's first state constitution in the office of
          the Secretary of State are a reflection on the care in matters of detail exercised by the Constitutional
          Convention. On page one, in the Preamble, that copy reads "one thousand thousand seven hundred and
          eighty-seven," instead of "one thousand seven hundred and eighty-seven." Either the
          word "any" was erroneously later inserted in the Secretary of State's manuscript in
          Article III, Section 14 ("guilty of any disrespect") or it was erroneously omitted from the
          recovered copy. "In extraordinary occasions" in Article IV, section 13, in the former
          manuscript, is "on extraordinary occasions" in the latter; "the army of the <placeName>
                  <country reg="-us">United States</country>
               </placeName>" in Article VII, section I, reads "the armies of the <placeName>
                  <country reg="-us">United States</country>
               </placeName>"; "they arrive," in Article VII, section 9, reads "they shall
          arrive"; and "humanity, honesty, industry and morality," in Article IX in the
          Secretary of State's copy reads "humanity, industry and morality" in the recovered
          copy. On the whole, the copy recovered by the Historical Society seems <pb n="364" id="VAA4025-030-4-056"/> to
          have somewhat fewer mistakes than the copy of the Secretary of State, but the advantage is not very great.</p>
            <p>The supposition that the copy recently obtained by the Historical Society was the copy used by the committee
          appointed by the Convention to supervise the printing of the Constitution is supported by the fact that the
          early printed copies follow it more closely than they do the other copy; follow it, that is, in most cases in
          which it differs from the other copy. Careful editors of later reprints have followed, as they should, the
          copy now in the office of the Secretary of State.</p>
            <p>It is possible, of course, that this last mentioned copy is not the one which the Constitutional Convention
          entrusted to Jonathan Jennings, which he transmitted to the Senate, and the custody of which the Senate in
          turn gave to the Secretary of State. Jennings himself may have furnished the copy for the printers who turned
          out the first printed edition of the Constitution. What was done with the other copy before Secretary of State
          Wick had both duplicates bound and shown, one to one branch of the General Assembly and one to the other
          branch, does not appear in the record. It is only a surmise that it was used by the committee on printing. All
          that is known is that it also was in the possession of Secretary of State Wick, in 1826, and was bound by him,
          like the other copy, "in morocco and gilt."</p>
            <p>There is justification for the belief that the copy which at some later date was allowed to pass out of the
          office of the Secretary of State was the one used in making the first printed copies. It is not stated
          positively whether it was the copy governed by the explicit direction of the Convention, or the copy about
          which the Convention was silent. If the former, the writer supposes the manuscript copy of the Constitution of
          1816 now in the office of the Secretary of State, became the official, authoritative copy only from the time
          the other copy (now in the State Library) disappeared. If the latter, it was the official copy from the
          beginning.</p>

            <p>The latest publication of the Historical Society is <hi rend="i">Early Architects and Builders of
          Indiana</hi> by Lee Burns, Volume XI, Number 3 of the <hi rend="i">Publications</hi>. Mr. Burns'
          article gives short sketches of the most important of the early architects and builders of the state, such as
          Francis Costigan and William Tinsley. He has brought new light to a number of pieces of information, and many
          readers of the article will doubtless find in it corrections of the versions they have accepted about the
          construction of some of the buildings of the state. The publication is illustrated by views of a number of
          typical buildings while details of certain features of others are presented.</p>

            <head>History Teachers' Forum: THE TRODDEN PATH</head>
            <byline>By O<hi rend="sc">LD</hi>-T<hi rend="sc">IMER</hi>
            </byline>
            <p>Years ago there was a path through the woods-pasture that many people used as a short cut to the main road
          that led on to the village. It was a gently winding path. There was a crude stile that enabled one to get over
          the rail fence at the edge of the pasture, and, close to the fence where the path started, stood a large
          white-oak. A few rods ahead as one passed along, there was a large granite boulder on the left. It was not a
          "granite boulder" to those who went that way— it was just "the big
          rock." Farther on, the line of travel took one around to the right of a fine clump of wild
          rose-bushes. Close by there was a lower area that did not drain well. Most of the year, this shallow basin was
          partly filled with water. Whether hurrying through or sauntering leisurely along, it did not matter, the path
          safely skirted the marshy sod or the mud at the outer rim of the pond. Just beyond there was a big, decaying
          walnut stump where a few years earlier had stood a splendid tree. A hundred paces on and not far from the old
          highway laid out by pioneers, stood the only evergreen among the three score of trees scattered over the
          thirty-acre tract. Passing this, one came at last to the "bars" guarding the opening into
          the public road. One could climb over, or slip back and let down "bars" two and three from
          the bottom, stoop over and step through or creep through to the outside. Before taking to the broad highway,
          by the unrecorded rules, the opening in the fence must be closed. It was almost a crime to leave the
          "bars" down.</p>
            <p>To anyone who was accustomed to follow that well-marked path across the old woods-pasture, one way or the
          other, it became a friendly, helpful feature of life. Every curve, each gentle incline up or down and all the
          objects on either side turned into familiar guides that directed the footsteps aright. A good many people who,
          coming and going, passed that way years ago can still picture the beaten pathway across the enclosed tract
          from stile to "bars" or "bars" to stile, and would now find real pleasure
          going over it again.</p>
            <p>Having taught history to many classes through a long period of years, Old Timer feels that any course in
          history <pb n="368" id="VAA4025-030-4-060"/> should stand out to both teacher and learner somewhat as the old
          woods-pasture with a familiar pathway across it. There would be some curves of course, some hill slopes, and
          some things presenting more or less distracting or difficult problems, but the clear pathway with its familiar
          events, their relations to each other and their order along the line of advance should always be there. Only
          the teacher of history who can readily follow and who loves to follow the highway through the history of any
          country or period can reveal it to the students in his classes. When the end of the semester or the year
          comes, students who cannot feel at home as they look forward or backward through the events which they have
          examined, analyzed and related to each other have really failed.</p>
            <p>The teacher of history who cannot, at any point in the course, be it Roman, Medieval, Modern, English or
          American history, place himself on any part of the pathway and go forward or backward with sure steps is
          poorly prepared for his work. Even the college or university professor who rightly prides himself on his skill
          in historical criticism, dares not lose sight of the need to make plain the pathway through the period. After
          all, research and historical criticism are not ends in themselves, but means to be used in reaching an
          understanding of the events, the actors in, and the movements of history.</p>
            <p>Old Timer does not believe that any teacher of history Should—</p>
            <p>Allow the text-book to control his teaching too completely.</p>
            <p>Allow a long series of interesting class discussions of current problems to usurp most of the time that
          should be devoted to the teaching of history.</p>
            <p>Allow himself to become a purveyor of propaganda for any self-seeking element of the country.</p>
            <p>Allow himself to use his power and influence over his classes to indoctrinate them with all the beliefs that
          he has himself accepted.</p>
            <p>Allow himself to think that he is too busy to read newspapers and magazines that deal with the questions of
          the day.</p>
            <pb n="369" id="VAA4025-030-4-061"/>
            <p>Allow himself to think that he has no time to read anything in addition to the text in larger histories,
          biographies, and source books.</p>
            <p>Allow himself to remain ignorant of historical geography and still believe that he is teaching history.</p>
            <p>Allow himself to believe that sets of true-false examination questions prepared by some one else are the only
          questions that he needs to use on his classes.</p>
            <p>Allow himself to think that he knows how well or how poorly his students are doing their work without giving
          adequate tests and carefully grading the papers.</p>

            <p>The political career of Jesse David Bright, a powerful Democratic leader of Indiana in his day, is full of
          interest. He was elected to the Senate of the <placeName>
                  <country reg="-us">United States</country>
               </placeName> in 1845, and while a member of that body, this able politician of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
               </placeName>, became the boss of his party in Indiana. He loved his friends and served them generously. He
          hated his enemies with intensity and fought them vigorously. In regard to the slavery question he was a
          conservative. In the pre-convention contest of 1856, the Senator threw his support to Buchanan, and, through
          his power over the Indiana Democracy, did more to bring about the defeat of Douglas and the nomination of the
          Pennsylvanian, than any other leader in the party. In January, 1860, the Democrats of Indiana staged a
          successful revolt against Senator Bright in their State Convention. His expulsion from the Senate came in
          February 1862. The next year, though Democrats controlled the Indiana Legislature on joint-ballot, they
          refused to vindicate Bright by returning him to the senate. Instead, a younger man who had been one of the
          leaders in the revolt of 1860 was chosen—David Turpie. Soon after this, Jesse D. Bright took up his
          residence in <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>, where he served two terms in the state Legislature. He died in 1876.</p>
            <p>The recipient of the Bright letters printed below, was William H. English (1822-1896), who was born in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
               </placeName>, Scott County, Indiana, where he lived until 1863. He served as a member of the constitutional
          convention of 1850, and as a member of the Indiana Legislature. He was a Representative in the national House
          for four terms (1853-1861). During the Civil War he moved to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
               </placeName>, where he was one of the founders of the First National Bank. He served as president of the
          institution until 1877. He wrote a two-volume history, <hi rend="i">The Conquest of the Country Northwest of
            the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> and Life of George Rogers Clark</hi>. This work was published in 1896,
          the year of the author's death.</p>

                  arrangement with you as to his indebtedness. This I will do if you require it, when we meet, which I
                  hope will not be later than the last of this month. Meantime, write and let me Know. what you require</p>

                  and let in scores of claims, heretofore rejected by Edwards. I am afraid of it, but yours I believe a
                  just claim &amp; I shall seek an Early opertunity to bring the matter before Heath and ask a
                  favorable decission. My correspondence will occupy most of my time [from] now on until the Senatorial
                  Election is over. You say Jo Wright<hi rend="sup">9</hi> is a Candidate. This I have believed would be
                  the case ever since Gov. Crittenden<hi rend="sup">10</hi> was invited to our
                  State—notwithstanding Joseph has been saying all the time, up to my coming away, that he
                  was not, &amp; would not be. He has acted unfairly and shows in several matters that will disclose
                  themselves, that He is a Trickster. An open and manly competitor I respect &amp; esteem, but one
                  of these subterannean operators, "God deliver me from." I want you English to confer
                  freely with my Partner Jo. Chapman &amp; have Elisha G<hi rend="sup">11</hi> do the same. He
                  (Chapman) will put you and your Father in possession of some facts I have collected here, and I should

                  if this is done, I shall try very hard to bring on this Election. Many of our friends here think this
                  cannot be done. The Abolition[ists] swear it never shall be unless they get one of the Senators

                        <p>Yours of the 5th Inst is recd. I am much obliged to you for your attentions in the way of interesting
                  letters. You recollect the old saying, that it is always "darker just before day, than at any
                  period of the 24 Hours." I see nothing to discourage. Coruption cannot long go unpunished,
                  when the "People" are jurors. The set of Creatures you mention, are on the surface
                  now, only because, they have not been properly attended to. Time with the aid of a few such open
                  gallant honest determined Democrats as you and some others I might name, have proved yourselves to be,
                  will remedy, what you now appear to regard as permanent evils. Although I am not in the same District
                  with your Father, I am not so far away, that I shall ever forget his friendship for me, or refuse to
                  come up, with zeal, to any work he may call for me in his behalf. I would rather have had Scott<hi rend="sup">23</hi> with us, but on the <list type="footnotes">

                  Judging the future, by the past, there is nothing you undertake, that you will not do. Hence, I
                  consider your election a "fixed fact," and such a result will do no man, more good,

                  but whether I can, depends upon the time I get home and the state of my health. I am far from being
                  well, and could not now, undergo, the fatigue of an extended canvass. I am in the daily receipt of
                  letters, inviting me to speak at different points, in and out of our state, most of which, thus far, I
                  have had to decline. I intend to return home by the White Sulphur Springs, and may, if I find that I
                  derive any benefit, from the use of water, remain there ten or twelve days, in which event, I would
                  not reach home before the 20th of September. I am very anxious to be there, in time to take part, in
                  the Presidential and Congressional canvasses. Though I must be permitted to say, that I believe Pierce
                  and King, will distance the track, without much grooming. I have, and shall continue, to send you,
                  such documents as I think will benefit you in the canvass. Bear in mind, the old
                  maxim—"Continual Dropping will wear a stone." Adopting this motto, and
                  working up to it, I believe you can be elected by one thousand majority. With my kind regards to your

                        <p>Yours of the 16th Inst is received. I am greatly disappointed at the defeat of our mutual friend Doct
                  Fitch, and if one half the men for him, had done there duty, half as well as you &amp; I, the
                  result would have been different. I am disappointed nay mortified, but not the least discouraged.
                  Honesty will prevail of [over] dishonesty in poloticks as in every other relation of life. The late
                  result is but a partial &amp; temporary triumph. I have not time this morning (with over 300
                  letters before me for answers) to enter into details, but I will before long try and take time to go
                  into matters more fully. As to you having impaired yourself for the
                  future—Nonsens—You have made friends, as every man does, by advocating the right
                  &amp; denouncing the wrong.</p>
                        <p>As matters have turned out, I dismiss the Cabinet from my mind. Nothing could now tempt me to resign
                  my place in the Senate, this would be suicidal to both myself (&amp; <hi rend="i">friends</hi>.</p>
                        <p>I have <hi rend="i">marked down</hi> the names you gave me, &amp; with pour aid &amp; a list
                  of others I have in my eye, that I recognize as <hi rend="i">true friends</hi>, we will prepare for
                  the future &amp; prove to the world "that we met them [at] Phillipi." I am
                  distinctly against any negotiations with Bill <placeName>

                        <p>I know you have a right to complain of my inattention to your letter of the 29th ultimo, but as God
                  is my judge, I have not had time since you left here to <hi rend="i">read</hi> my letters, much less
                  to <hi rend="i">answer</hi> them. I have been going to and fro—here &amp;
                  there—for friends who are either here in person, or have been here, and those who would
                  write me; but I will not enter upon what I have done, or am doing, for that would fill a Book. Leave
                  all this until we meet, and then if it is not refered to, there will be nothing lost. Office, Office,
                  Office, Office Seekers, Office Seekers, Office Seekers, how these words ring in my ears, You &amp;
                  Fitch have escaped that kind of wrath and persecution described in divine revelation by going home,
                  however, I am not discussing the points I set down to notice.</p>
                        <p>I wish I could make a trip West with the Major &amp; yourself, but I cannot get off before the
                  1st or 10 of June and of course you must start sooner if you intend to attend the <placeName>

                        <p>I hope and suppose there is no doubt but that I will get home before you come, and if so, will of
                  course see you. Your information as to my having urged any particular man for a Cabinet appointment
                  from Indiana, <hi rend="i">After</hi> Mr Buchanan reached <placeName>
                              <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                           </placeName> is an entire mistake. I was asked to do so and declined for reasons entirely satisfactory
                  to myself. Perhaps I ought to say that I presume I could have formed a part of Mr Buchanans Cabinet
                  any time before his inaugeration but this I told you on one occasion was a matter that I did not want
                  to talk about. It has annoyed me beyond measure, and I will repeat to you, that there is no
                  respectable office in the U S. that I would not rather take than a Cabinet place, and I think the men
                  who now have them reason somewhat as I do.</p>

                        <p>Yours of yesterday is received. I: am very much obliged to you for your pressing invitation to make
                  you a visit, but my dear friend there is no rest for me, I have been sick for the last 5 weeks (until
                  within the last 10 days), and in this way have fallen so far behind with my business and
                  correspondence that I have almost despaired of ever catching up, but still I must try. I shall go Home
                  to morrow, and hope to see you sometime soon—indeed I intend to try this fall to spend a
                  day at <placeName>

                        <p>Everything looks well for our Party in this State. A few Traitors have been trying to raise some
                  excitement but their efforts have proven a <hi rend="i">dead failure</hi>. In short, the Wright
                  &amp; Co concern have failed, and in the absence of their cowardly leader, the other partners have
                  gone into <pb n="383" id="VAA4025-030-4-075"/> liquidation. But more on this head when we meet. I <hi rend="i">know</hi> now who turned Sam English out, the very man I believed done it on my first
                  hearing it. H——[?] Cobb<hi rend="sup">36</hi> I presume wrote you fully and
                  freely on the subject. <hi rend="i">He told me he would</hi>.</p>
                        <p>I am for encouraging your Uncle to expose the hypocrisy &amp; double dealing of one man toward

                        <p>I was sorry you could not find time to write me before I left my farm. You discover, that the threats
                  of the assassins of character in the West, who have been pursuing me in their licentious sheets
                  because I will not adopt there opinions, and allow them to control my action, did not prevent me from
                  exercising all the rights of a citizen &amp; Senator. I am here, with a stout heart &amp; pure
                  conscience and yet dare do what I think right. There is not power on earth to make an Abolitionist out
                  of me. The Presidents Message<hi rend="sup">42</hi> is a more conservative paper than was generally
                  expected from him. The radicals are not at all pleased with its tone, while the more conservative
                  practical minded men here think it means the cold shoulder to the Fire &amp; Sword branch of the
                  Republican party.</p>
                        <p>I confess I do not know what it looks to, as yet I see no green spot in the distant future.</p>
                        <p>There is some talk I understand of their expelling me on account of my known disloyalty. Let is come,
                  I have got so that I believe nothing I read and am not surprised at anything that takes place.</p>
                        <p>However I did not intend writing about politicks but rather about business, and what I say in this
                  respect is <hi rend="i">confidential</hi>. My brother M G B is hard up for some funds and I suppose
                  (as usual) I have got!o help him.<hi rend="sup">43</hi> I want you to tell me candidly what you think
                  I may rely upon this Winter and Spring from the Dunham fund, this is all, I do not want to borrow, but
                  to collect all possible. See how much you can get for my little Farm in the terms you and the Major
                  are selling your bonds at, and write me. I am very anxious to sell, and want you to find a purchaser
                  for me, when it does not interfere with your sales.</p>
                        <p>Please see that my Taxes are paid &amp; collect enough rent to do it with.</p>

                        <p>I send by this mail a letter intended for Dunhams eye. Send it to him if you choose.</p>
                        <p>I ought to have answered yours of the 2nd of June earlier, but I was in hopes I should have had time
                  to have run up to your House when West, last month. I intended to have no more transactions of any
                  name or nature with Mr Dunham, let matters rest where they are as far as Securities are concerned.
                  Have you been able to get the $575.00 due from H Westphal. The reason I ask is that I was
                  going to ask you to put it to my credit in the <placeName>

                  Writ of "Habeas Corpus" is ignored by a Military Mob.</p>
                        <p>I wish to God you would come on and spend a few days or week while we are in Session. I have got a
                  good spare Room in my House, would treat you as well as I know how, and be more than happy to have
                  you.</p>

                  with painful threats of Rheumatism, but have escaped the real old fashioned attack, and now feel
                  pretty confident, I shall be able to keep about, which is a matter of some moment to me, at <hi rend="i">this time</hi>.</p>
                        <p>Whatever you do with creditors to the Dunham fund will be right. I consider that I am very fortunate
                  in having an honest and as cunning a friend as <hi rend="i">I know</hi> you to be, to attend to my
                  business instead of myself.</p>
                        <p>I send you by to days Mail 3 copies of the Mechanical part of the Pat. Rept. for 1861. Anything I can
                  do for you here let me know, it will be done with all my heart?</p>
                        <p>I am glad that my Abolition enemies have opened there Battery in the form of a proposition to expel
                  me, you shall say before it [is] over that they have come out in this, as in all there past assaults

                  politicks, because I do not care a damn as between Abolitionists &amp; Douglasites I shall never

                        <p>Yours of the 28 Inst is received. Exercise your own judgment in reference to notes we hold on Porter,
                  indeed I make the remark general, whatever you do, I <hi rend="i">approve</hi>. You are on the ground,
                  know more of the conditions of parties that owe us. Whether produce is likely to command a market,

                        <p>I had a letter from A J Cam, Treasurer of Clark Co. telling me that my Taxes $145.50 must
                  be paid without delay. I have written to Mr. Sparks to collect the last Installment of rent due me if
                  possible and pay the same—if he does not do it, I am going to draw on you for that amount
                  to be repaid when I come out, or before if you need it</p>

                     <hi rend="sup">47</hi> On January 6. 1862, when the Senate was giving consideration to the eligibility of
              a certain new member to a seat in the Senate, Charles Sumner included the following in some brief remarks:
              "The Senate is at this moment engaged in considering the loyalty of certain members of this body,
              and it seems to me it would poorly do its duty if it admitted among its members one with regard to whom,
              as he came forward to take his oath, there was a reasonable suspicion." The person whose case was
              before the Senate was an appointee of the Governor of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>
                     </placeName>, but Bright felt that Sumner had aimed a shaft in his direction as well, which was true. In
              answer to the gentleman from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                     </placeName>, Bright made the brief speech mentioned in his letter to English:</p>
                  <p> "The Senator from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                     </placeName> remarked that the Senate were now engaged in examining into the loyalty of certain members of
              this body. I suppose he alluded to me. I am in that category, and the examination is based on three lines
              that it is alleged I wrote in a letter for a friend of mine, dated as far back as the first day of March
              last [Before the beginning of the War]. The objectionable feature is that I addressed Jefferson Davis as
              president of the confederate States. In that I was but following the example of Senators upon this floor
              who, day after day, spoke and addressed him by that title at that time: yet no exception was taken to
              that. However I do not propose arguing my case now: it would be out of time and place: but I want it to go
              out to the world with the statement of the Senator from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                     </placeName>, that, as far as I am concerned, I hope the Senate are examining into my case, and I am very
              sorry that they have progressed so slowly. I am impatient for the investigation and anxious for the
              result, ready to meet it at any time it may come, and the sooner the better. I say this much for the
              information of the committee who have my case in charge, and for my friends at a distance, who appear to
              be borrowing some trouble on my account. I do not ask their sympathy. I have done nothing that I would not
              do over again under the same circumstances, and that I am not prepared to defend here as
              elsewhere." <hi rend="i">Cong. Globe</hi>. 87 Cong., 2 Sess., 184.</p>

              it for themselves:</p>

                        <p>I propose remaining here until Thursday 12 o'clock. I am very anxious to see you, and I will
                  in a few words state why. I want to sell out my interests in the Dunham debt because I need the money
                    <hi rend="i">now</hi>, and I want you to purchase it. 2nd There is a move or two, to be made on the
                  political boards, that it would require too much time to explain on paper, but if you will come down
                  tomorrow, or next day I will explain it all to you, in person. It is something that will interest you,
                  as much as me, and more you than me, in the end. I hope you will come, enquire for me at Sparks Store,
                  if not there at Major Jarvis Store in this City.</p>

            <head>Comment</head>
            <p>If David Lloyd George had died in 1919, he would have been regarded as a powerful party leader, almost
          irresistable in his appeal to the voters of the <placeName>
                  <country reg="-uk">United Kingdom</country>
               </placeName>. Since the coalition ministry formed in the later war period which he headed went out of office,
          he has found no party to lead or no party willing to follow him. The estimate placed on his capacity in that
          line will therefore be very different because he has lived through the period since the World War. Clemenceau
          had won no outstanding place in world history or even in French history prior to the World War, at the
          beginning of which, in 1914, he was seventy-three years of age. Still vigorous, physically and mentally, he
          was able to become one of the strongest men of the hour. Whether we praise or condemn what he did during the
          War and at the <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Versailles</settlement>
               </placeName> Conference, there is no question about the powerful influence which he exerted on his country and
          the world. If Woodrow Wilson had suffered collapse at the opening of the Peace Conference, as he did
          afterwards, what would the best of biographers say of his loss to the Conference?</p>
            <p>It has often been said that Lincoln was fortunate in that his labors ended with the close of the Civil War,
          and it does seem that there was a possibility that he could not have gone through the "Tragic
          Era" without loss of prestige. It is not always true, but often it is surely true, that no correct
          summary of a man's career can be made without due consideration of the age at which death came to
          him.</p>
            <p>The belief is common that Alexander the Great, Napoleon, Alexander <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
               </placeName>—men who died in middle life—had accomplished their work in the world before
          the summons came. In regard to Caesar, Cromwell, Theodore Roosevelt—there remains a question. In
          the case of Stephen A. Douglas, it seems very plain that it is impossible to pass a fair judgment on his
          career without remembering that his life ended when he was but forty-eight years of age. Most of the men born
          at about the same time as Douglas are known very largely by what they did and said and stood for in the years
          of the Civil War and Reconstruction.</p>
            <p>Douglas has had the misfortune to be studied and interpreted in connection with <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
               </placeName>. No other man of the time has been so universally contrasted with the emancipator. <pb n="394" id="VAA4025-030-4-086"/> Remembering that Douglas had no opportunity to play a part during the armed
          conflict between North and South, it is manifestly unfair that he should have been so often unfavorably
          compared with <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
               </placeName>. If the latter had died at the beginning of 1854 when he was forty-five years of age, he would be
          accorded very few lines in the pages of any history and no biography at all. When Douglas died he was only
          three years older than was <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
               </placeName> in 1854. It was not until the last mentioned year, that Lincoln found a cause and took a stand
          which gave him some claim to a place in history. Even hostile critics of Douglas usually declare that he rose
          to a high stature in 1858 when he fought against the admission of <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
               </placeName> under the Lecompton Constitution. In that year, he arrived at the age which <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
               </placeName> had attained in 1854.</p>
            <p>It is impossible to conjecture what manner of statesman Douglas would have become had he lived to the age of
          sixty or seventy, but it is entirely proper to give attention to his early death when passing judgment on his
          character and career. He should be judged by his statesmanship in the period through which he was permitted to
          live and by his understanding of what it was best to do to avoid serious dangers that were likely to come.</p>
            <p>Indiana is a wealthy state. It is a commonwealth in which there is much culture, where there is a belief in
          general education and even in the promotion of scholarship. Nevertheless, the patient researcher by whose work
          new knowledge is added to the world's store in one field or another, is one of the forgotten men of
          the state. There is no center in Indiana where either through state appropriations or private endowment,
          research can be carried on as it should be. It is very easy to economize where so few seem to be concerned.
          The fundamental truth is, however, that a multitude of people are involved. College education, high school
          training, elementary teaching, all will suffer in time, but the greatest tragedy resulting from the starvation
          of research work at a great university is what happens to the faculty. No university can remain a great
          institution and no faculty can keep above the water line very long unless a spirit of scholarship prevails,
          which spirit can only live where reasonable facilities for research are provided.</p>

            <p>In the last year of his life, Daniel Webster was asked to speak before the <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
               </placeName> Historical Society, which invitation he accepted. Certain passages from the address of the old
          statesman are well worth quoting: <quote rend="blockquote">
                  <p>But History, while it illustrates and adorns, confines itself to facts, and to the true narrative of
              actual events. It is not far from the truth to say, that well written History is the Epic of real life. It
              places the actions of men in an attractive and interesting light; rejecting what is improper and
              superfluous, it fills its picture with real, just and well drawn images.</p>
                  <p>And the dignity of History consists in relating events with truth and accuracy, and in presenting human
              agents and their actions in a clear and impartial light. The first element in History, therefore, is
              truthfulness; and this truthfulness must be presented in concrete form.</p>

            <p>An effort is now being made to interest the high school teacher of history in Indiana in the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi>. During the year now closing a new department, "History
          Teachers' Forum," has been added. Matter suitable to this department is desired, and brief
          articles from teachers of history in high schools and colleges will be welcomed by the <hi rend="i">Editor</hi>.</p>
            <p>A hope is indulged by those interested in the preservation and study of Indiana history that many, indeed
          very many, of the high schools of the state will become members of the Indiana Historical Society. Very few
          high schools have a file of the <hi rend="i">Publications</hi> and <hi rend="i">Bulletins</hi> issued by the
          Society or of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> published by Indiana University. All of these
          will come regularly each year to every high school becoming a member of the Society. The annual dues are
          $3.00 for any institution. The time will come when files of the publications available now through
          the outlay of this small sum will be much desired by high schools. They will prove valuable as they are
          periodically received, but they will become worth more with the passage of years. Students and teachers who
          work in the high schools of the future will praise those who act wisely in the present, but will have good
          reason to look back with disfavor on those who do not.</p>

            <p>Full sets of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> can rarely be supplied to libraries or individuals who may desire

          1906-1913, when they can be supplied at all, will be sold at one and a half dollars per number.</p>
