                    <head type="subtitle">A BOY AND HIS DOG</head>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="b">P</hi>ENROD sat morosely upon the back fence and gazed with
                        envy at Duke, his wistful dog.</p>
                    <p>A bitter soul dominated the various curved and angular surfaces known by a
                        careless world as the face of Penrod Schofield. Except in solitude, that
                        face was almost always cryptic and emotionless; for Penrod had come into his
                        twelfth year wearing an expression carefully trained to be inscrutable.
                        Since the world was sure to misunderstand everything, mere defensive
                        instinct prompted him to give <pb id="VAA2383-012" n="4"/> it as little as
                        possible to lay hold upon. Nothing is more impenetrable than the face of a
                        boy who has learned this, and Penrod&apos;s was habitually as
                        fathom-less as the depth of his hatred this morning for the literary
                        activities of Mrs. Lora Rewbushan almost universally respected fellow
                        citizen, a lady of charitable and poetic inclinations, and one of his own
                        mother&apos;s most intimate friends.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Lora Rewbush had written something which she called &quot;The
                        Children&apos;s Pageant of the Table Round,&quot; and it was to be
                        performed in public that very afternoon at the Women&apos;s Arts and
                        Guild Hall for the benefit of the Coloured Infants&apos; Betterment
                        Society. And if any flavour of sweetness remained in the nature of Penrod
                        Schofield after the dismal trials of the school-week just past, that
                        problematic, infinitesimal remnant was made pungent acid by the imminence of
                        his destiny to form a prominent feature of the spectacle, and to declaim the
                        loathsome sentiments of a character named upon the programme the Child Sir
                        Lancelot.</p>
                    <p>After each rehearsal he had plotted escape, and only ten days earlier there
                        had been a glimmer of light: Mrs. Lora Rewbush caught a very bad cold, and
                        it was hoped it might develop into pneumonia; <pb id="VAA2383-013" n="5"/>
                        but she recovered so quickly that not even a rehearsal of the
                        Children&apos;s Pageant was postponed. Darkness closed in. Penrod had
                        rather vaguely debated plans for a self-mutilation such as would make his
                        appearance as the Child Sir Lancelot inexpedient on public grounds; it was a
                        heroic and attractive thought, but the results of some extremely sketchy
                        preliminary experiments caused him to abandon it.</p>
                    <p>There was no escape; and at last his hour was hard upon him. Therefore he
                        brooded on the fence and gazed with envy at his wistful Duke.</p>
                    <p>The dog&apos;s name was undescriptive of his person, which was obviously
                        the result of a singular series of msalliances. He wore a grizzled moustache
                        and indefinite whiskers; he was small and shabby, and looked like an old
                        postman. Penrod envied Duke because he was sure Duke would never be
                        compelled to be a Child Sir Lancelot. He thought a dog free and unshackled
                        to go or come as the wind listeth. Penrod forgot the life he led Duke.</p>
                    <p>There was a long soliloquy upon the fence, a plaintive monologue without
                        words: the boy&apos;s thoughts were adjectives, but they were expressed
                        by a running film of pictures in his mind&apos;s eye, morbidly prophetic
                        of the hideosities before him. Finally he <pb id="VAA2383-014" n="6"/> spoke
                        aloud, with such spleen that Duke rose from his haunches and lifted one ear
                        in keen anxiety.</p>
                    <lg>
                        <l n="1">&quot;&apos;I hight Sir Lancelot du Lake, the Child,</l>
                        <l n="2">Gentul-hearted, meek, and mild.</l>
                        <l n="3">What though I&apos;m <hi rend="i">but</hi> a littul child,</l>
                        <l n="4">Gentul-hearted, meek, and&apos; <hi rend="i"
                            >Oof!&quot;</hi>
                        </l>
                    </lg>
                    <p>All of this except &quot;oof&quot; was a quotation from the Child Sir
                        Lancelot, as conceived by Mrs. Lora Rew-bush. Choking upon it, Penrod slid
                        down from the fence, and with slow and thoughtful steps entered a
                        one-storied wing of the stable, consisting of a single apartment, floored
                        with cement and used as a storeroom for broken bric--brac, old
                        paint-buckets, decayed garden-hose, worn-out carpets, dead furniture, and
                        other condemned odds and ends not yet considered hopeless enough to be given
                        away.</p>
                    <p>In one corner stood a large box, a part of the building itself: it was eight
                        feet high and open at the top, and it had been constructed as a sawdust
                        magazine from which was drawn material for the horse&apos;s bed in a
                        stall on the other side of the partition. The big box, so high and
                        towerlike, so commodious, so suggestive, had ceased to fulfil its legitimate
                        function; though, providentially, it had been at least <pb id="VAA2383-015"
                            n="7"/> half full of sawdust when the horse died. Two years had gone by
                        since that passing; an interregnum in transportation during which
                        Penrod&apos;s father was &quot;thinking&quot; (he explained
                        sometimes) of an automobile. Meanwhile, the gifted and generous sawdust-box
                        had served brilliantly in war and peace: it was Penrod&apos;s
                        stronghold.</p>
                    <p>There was a partially defaced sign upon the front wall of the box; the
                        donjon-keep had known mercantile impulses:</p>
                    <q direct="unspecified">
                        <p rend="center">The O. K. RaBiT Co.<lb/> PENROD ScHoFiELD AND CO.<lb/>
                            iNQuiRE FOR PRicEs</p>
                    </q>
                    <p>This was a venture of the preceding vacation, and had netted, at one time, an
                        accrued and owed profit of $1.38. Prospects had been brightest on the very
                        eve of cataclysm. The storeroom was locked and guarded, but twenty-seven
                        rabbits and Belgian hares, old and young, had perished here on a single
                        nightthrough no human agency, but in a foray of cats, the besiegers
                        treacherously tunnelling up through the sawdust from the small aperture
                        which opened into the stall beyond the partition. Commerce has its martyrs.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-016" n="8"/>
                    <p>Penrod climbed upon a barrel, stood on tiptoe, grasped the rim of the box;
                        then, using a knot-hole as a stirrup, threw one leg over the top, drew
                        himself up, and dropped within. Standing upon the packed sawdust, he was
                        just tall enough to see over the top.</p>
                    <p>Duke had not followed him into the storeroom, but remained near the open
                        doorway in a concave and pessimistic attitude. Penrod felt in a dark corner
                        of the box and laid hands upon a simple apparatus consisting of an old
                        bushel-basket with a few yards of clothes-line tied to each of its handles.
                        He passed the ends of the lines over a big spool, which revolved upon an
                        axle of wire suspended from a beam overhead, and, with the aid of this
                        improvised pulley, lowered the empty basket until it came to rest in an
                        upright position upon the floor of the storeroom at the foot of the
                        sawdust-box.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Eleva-ter!&quot; shouted Penrod. &quot;Ting-ting!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Duke, old and intelligently apprehensive, approached slowly, in a
                        semicircular manner, deprecatingly, but with courtesy. He pawed the basket
                        delicately; then, as if that were all his master had expected of him,
                        uttered one bright bark, sat down, and looked up triumphantly. His hypocrisy
                        was <pb id="VAA2383-017" n="9"/> shallow: many a horrible quarter of an hour
                        had taught him his duty in this matter.</p>
                    <p>&quot;El-e-<hi rend="i">vay</hi>-ter!&quot; shouted Penrod sternly.
                        &quot;You want me to come down there <hi rend="i">to</hi> you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Duke looked suddenly haggard. He pawed the basket feebly again and, upon
                        another outburst from on high, prostrated himself flat. Again threatened, he
                        gave a superb impersonation of a worm.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You get in that el-e-VAY-ter!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Reckless with despair, Duke jumped into the basket, landing in a dishevelled
                        posture, which he did not alter until he had been drawn up and poured out
                        upon the floor of sawdust with the box. There, shuddering, he lay in
                        doughnut shape and presently slumbered.</p>
                    <p>It was dark in the box, a condition that might have been remedied by sliding
                        back a small wooden panel on runners, which would have let in ample light
                        from the alley; but Penrod Schofield had more interesting means of
                        illumination. He knelt, and from a former soap-box, in a corner, took a
                        lantern without a chimney, and a large oil-can, the leak in the latter being
                        so nearly imperceptible that its banishment from household use had seemed to
                        Pen-rod as inexplicable as it was providential.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-018" n="10"/>
                    <p>He shook the lantern near his ear: nothing splashed; there was no sound but a
                        dry clinking. But there was plenty of kerosene in the can; and he filled the
                        lantern, striking a match to illumine the operation. Then he lit the lantern
                        and hung it upon a nail against the wall. The sawdust floor was slightly
                        impregnated with oil, and the open flame quivered in suggestive proximity to
                        the side of the box; however, some rather deep charrings of the plank
                        against which the lantern hung offered evidence that the arrangement was by
                        no means a new one, and indicated at least a possibility of no fatality
                        occurring this time.</p>
                    <p>Next, Penrod turned up the surface of the saw-dust in another corner of the
                        floor, and drew forth a cigar-box in which were half a dozen cigarettes,
                        made of hayseed and thick brown wrapping paper, a lead-pencil, an eraser,
                        and a small note-book, the cover of which was labelled in his own
                        handwriting:</p>

                    <p>The first page of this book was purely academic; but the study of English

                        knees to support the note-book, turned to a blank page, and wrote, slowly

                    <p>He took a knife from his pocket, and, broodingly, his eyes upon the inward
                        embryos of vision, sharpened his pencil. After that, he extended a foot and
                            <pb id="VAA2383-021" n="13"/> meditatively rubbed Duke&apos;s back
                        with the side of his shoe. Creation, with Penrod, did not leap, full-armed,
                        from the brain; but finally he began to produce. He wrote very slowly at
                        first, and then with increasing rapidity; faster and faster, gathering
                        momentum and growing more and more fevered as he sped, till at last the true

                            bonds off</p>
                        <p>Soon Mr Wilson came back to tant him with his helpless condition flowed
                            by his gang of detectives and they said Oh look at Ramorez sneering at
                            his plight and tanted him with his helpless condition because Ramorez
                            had put the bonds back sos he would <pb id="VAA2383-022" n="14"/> look
                            the same but could throw them off him when he wanted <unclear/> Just
                            look at him now sneered they. To hear him talk you would thought he was
                            hot stuff and they said Look at him now, him that was going to do so
                            much, Oh I would not like to be in his fix</p>
                        <p>Soon Harold got mad at this and jumped up with blasing eyes throwin off
                            his bonds like they were air Ha Ha sneered he I guess you better not
                            talk so much next time. Soon there flowed another awful struggle and
                            siezin his ottomatick back from Mr Wilson he shot two of the detectives
                            through the heart Bing Bing went the ottomatick and two more went to
                            meet their Maker only two detectives left now and so he stabbed one and
                            the scondrel went to meet his Maker for now our hero was fighting for
                            his very life. It was dark in there now for night had falen and a
                            terrible view met the eye Blood was just all over everything and the
                            rats were eatin the dead men.</p>
                        <p>Soon our hero manged to get his back to the wall for he was fighting for
                            his very life now and shot Mr Wilson through the abodmen Oh said Mr
                            Wilson you(<hi rend="i">The dashes are Penrod&apos;s.</hi>)</p>
                        <p>Mr Wilson stagerd back vile oaths soilin his lips for he was in pain Why
                            youyou sneered he I will get you yetyou Harold Ramorez</p>
                        <p>The remainin scondrel had an ax which he came near our heros head with
                            but missed him and ramand stuck in the wall Our heros amunition was
                            exhaused what was he to do, the remanin scondrel would soon get his ax
                            lose so our hero sprung forward and bit him till his teeth met in the
                            flech for now our hero was fighting for his very life. At this the
                            remanin scondrel also cursed and swore vile oaths. Oh sneered heyou
                            Harold Ramorez what did you bite me for Yes sneered Mr Wilson also and

                        <p>Soon they were both cursin and reviln him together Why yousneered they
                            what did you want to injure us foryou Harold Ramorez you have not got

                        <p>Soon our hero could stand this no longer. If you could learn to act like
                            gentlmen said he I would not do any more to you now and your low vile
                            exppresions have not got any effect on me only to injure your own self
                            when you go to meet your Maker Oh I guess you have had enogh for one day

                            Harold Ramorez again so with a tantig laugh he cooly lit a cigarrete and
                            takin the keys of the cell from Mr Wilson poket went on out</p>
                        <p>Soon Mr Wilson and the wonded detective manged to bind up their wonds and
                            got up off the floorit I will have that dasstads life now sneered they

                        <hi rend="i">&quot;Penrod!&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>It was his mother&apos;s voice, calling from the back porch.</p>
                    <p>Simultaneously, the noon whistles began to blow, far and near; and the
                        romancer in the sawdust-box, summoned prosaically from steep mountain passes
                        above the clouds, paused with stubby pencil half-way from lip to knee. His
                        eyes were shining: there was a rapt sweetness in his gaze. As he wrote, his
                        burden had grown lighter; thoughts of Mrs. Lora Rewbush had almost left him;
                        and in particular as he recounted (even by the chaste dash) the annoyed
                        expressions of Mr. Wilson, the wounded detective, and the silken moustached
                        mule-driver, he had felt mysteriously relieved concerning the Child Sir
                        Lancelot. Altogether he looked a better and a brighter boy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Pen-<hi rend="i">rod!&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The rapt look faded slowly. He sighed, but moved not.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Penrod! We&apos;re having lunch early just on your account, so
                        you&apos;ll have plenty of time to be dressed for the pageant.
                        Hurry!&quot;</p>
                    <p>There was silence in Penrod&apos;s aerie.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">&quot;Pen</hi>-rod!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-025" n="17"/>
                    <p>Mrs. Schofield&apos;s voice sounded nearer, indicating a threatened
                        approach. Penrod bestirred himself: he blew out the lantern, and shouted
                        plaintively:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, ain&apos;t I coming fast&apos;s I can?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do hurry,&quot; returned the voice, withdrawing; and the
                        kitchen door could be heard to close.</p>
                    <p>Languidly, Penrod proceeded to set his house in order.</p>
                    <p>Replacing his manuscript and pencil in the cigar-box, he carefully buried the
                        box in the sawdust, put the lantern and oil-can back in the soap-box,
                        adjusted the elevator for the reception of Duke, and, in no uncertain tone,
                        invited the devoted animal to enter.</p>
                    <p>Duke stretched himself amiably, affecting not to hear; and when this pretence
                        became so obvious that even a dog could keep it up no longer, sat down in a
                        corner, facing it, his back to his master, and his head perpendicular, nose
                        upward, supported by the convergence of the two walls. This, from a dog, is
                        the last word, the <hi rend="i">comble</hi> of the immutable. Penrod
                        commanded, stormed, tried gentleness; persuaded with honeyed words and
                        pictured rewards. Duke&apos;s eyes looked backward; otherwise he moved
                        not. Time elapsed. Penrod stooped to flattery. <pb id="VAA2383-026" n="18"/>
                        finally to insincere caresses; then, losing patience, spouted sudden
                        threats. Duke remained immovable, frozen fast to his great gesture of
                        implacable despair.</p>
                    <p>A footstep sounded on the threshold of the store-room.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Penrod, come down from that box this instant!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ma&apos;am?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are you up in that sawdust-box again?&quot; As Mrs. Schofield
                        had just heard her son&apos;s voice issue from the box, and also, as she
                        knew he was there anyhow, her question must have been put for oratorical
                        purposes only. &quot;Because if you are,&quot; she continued
                        promptly, &quot;I&apos;m going to ask your papa not to let you play
                        there any&quot;</p>
                    <p>Penrod&apos;s forehead, his eyes, the tops of his ears, and most of his
                        hair, became visible to her at the top of the box. &quot;I
                        ain&apos;t &apos;playing!&apos;&quot; he said indignantly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, what <hi rend="i">are</hi> you doing?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just coming down,&quot; he replied, in a grieved but patient
                        tone.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then why don&apos;t you <hi rend="i">come?&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>&quot;I got Duke here. I got to get him <hi rend="i">down,</hi>
                        haven&apos;t I? You don&apos;t suppose I want to leave a poor dog in
                        here to starve, do you?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-027" n="19"/>
                    <p>&quot;Well, hand him down over the side to me. Let me&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll get him down all right,&quot; said Penrod.
                        &quot;I got him up here, and I guess I can get him down!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well then, <hi rend="i">do</hi> it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I will if you&apos;ll let me alone. If you&apos;ll go on
                        back to the house I promise to be there inside of two minutes.
                        Honest!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He put extreme urgency into this, and his mother turned toward the house.
                        &quot;If you&apos;re not there in two minutes&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I will be!&quot;</p>
                    <p>After her departure, Penrod expended some finalities of eloquence upon Duke,
                        then disgustedly gathered him up in his arms, dumped him into the basket
                        and, shouting sternly, &quot;All in for the ground floorstep back there,
                        madamall ready, Jim!&quot; lowered dog and basket to the floor of the
                        storeroom. Duke sprang out in tumultuous relief, and bestowed frantic
                        affection upon his master as the latter slid down from the box.</p>
                    <p>Penrod dusted himself sketchily, experiencing a sense of satisfaction, dulled
                        by the overhanging afternoon, perhaps, but perceptible: he had the feeling
                        of one who has been true to a cause. The operation <pb id="VAA2383-028"
                            n="20"/> of the elevator was unsinful and, save for the shock to
                        Duke&apos;s nervous system, it was harmless; but Penrod could not
                        possibly have brought himself to exhibit it in the presence of his mother or
                        any other grown person in the world. The reasons for secrecy were undefined;
                        at least, Penrod did not define them.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="b">A</hi>FTER lunch his mother and his sister Margaret, a pretty
                        girl of nineteen, dressed him for the sacrifice. They stood him near his
                        mother&apos;s bedroom window and did what they would to him.</p>
                    <p>During the earlier anguishes of the process he was mute, exceeding the pathos
                        of the stricken calf in the shambles; but a student of eyes might have
                        perceived in his soul the premonitory symptoms of a sinister uprising. At a
                        rel earsal (in citizens&apos; clothes) attended by mothers and grown-up
                        sisters, Mrs. Lora Rewbush had announced that she wished the costuming <pb
                            id="VAA2383-030" n="22"/> to be &quot;as medieval and artistic as
                        possible.&quot; Otherwise, and as to details, she said, she would leave
                        the costumes entirely to the good taste of the children&apos;s parents.
                        Mrs. Schofield and Margaret were no archologists, but they knew that their
                        taste was as good as that of other mothers and sisters concerned; so with
                        perfect confidence they had planned and executed a costume for Penrod; and
                        the only misgiving they felt was connected with the tractability of the
                        Child Sir Lancelot himself.</p>
                    <p>Stripped to his underwear, he had been made to wash himself vehemently; then
                        they began by shrouding his legs in a pair of silk stockings, once blue but
                        now mostly whitish. Upon Penrod they visibly surpassed mere ampleness; but
                        they were long, and it required only a rather loose imagination to assume
                        that they were tights.</p>
                    <p>The upper part of his body was next concealed from view by a garment so
                        peculiar that its description becomes difficult. In 1886, Mrs. Schofield,
                        then unmarried, had worn at her &quot;coming-out party&quot; a dress
                        of vivid salmon silk which had been remodelled after her marriage to accord
                        with various epochs of fashion until a final, unskilful campaign at a
                        dye-house had left it in a condition certain to <pb id="VAA2383-031" n="23"
                        /> attract much attention to the wearer. Mrs. Schofield had considered
                        giving it to Della, the cook; but had decided not to do so, because you
                        never could tell how Della was going to take things, and cooks were scarce.</p>
                    <p>It may have been the word &quot;medieval&quot; (in Mrs. Lora
                        Rewbush&apos;s rich phrase) which had inspired the idea for a last
                        conspicuous usefulness; at all events, the bodice of that once salmon dress,
                        somewhat modified and moderated, now took a position, for its farewell
                        appearance in society, upon the back, breast, and arms of the Child Sir
                        Lancelot.</p>
                    <p>The area thus costumed ceased at the waist, leaving a Jaeger-like and
                        unmedieval gap thence to the tops of the stockings. The inventive genius of
                        woman triumphantly bridged it, but in a manner which imposes upon history
                        almost insuperable delicacies of narrations. Penrod&apos;s father was an
                        old-fashioned man: the twentieth century had failed to shake his faith in
                        red flannel for cold weather; and it was while Mrs. Schofield was putting
                        away her husband&apos;s winter underwear that she perceived how
                        hopelessly one of the elder specimens had dwindled; and simultaneously she
                        received the inspiration which resulted in a pair of trunks for the Child
                        Sir <pb id="VAA2383-032" n="24"/> Lancelot, and added an earnest bit of
                        colour, as well as a genuine touch of the Middle Ages, to his costume.
                        Reversed, fore to aft, with the greater part of the legs cut off, and strips
                        of silver braid covering the seams, this garment, she felt, was not
                        traceable to its original source.</p>
                    <p>When it had been placed upon Penrod, the stockings were attached to it by a
                        system of safety-pins, not very perceptible at a distance. Next, after being
                        severely warned against stooping, Penrod got his feet into the slippers he
                        wore to dancing-school&quot;patent-leather pumps&quot; now decorated
                        with large pink rosettes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If I can&apos;t stoop,&quot; he began, smolderingly,
                        &quot;I&apos;d like to know how&apos;m I goin&apos; to kneel
                        in the pag&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You must <hi rend="i">manage!&quot;</hi> This, uttered through,
                        pins, was evidently thought to be sufficient.</p>
                    <p>They fastened some ruching about his slender neck, pinned ribbons at random
                        all over him, and then Margaret thickly powdered his hair.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, yes, that&apos;s all right,&quot; she said, replying to
                        a question put by her mother. &quot;They always powdered their hair in
                        Colonial times.&quot;</p>

                    <p>&quot;That doesn&apos;t matter,&quot; Margaret reassured her,
                        &quot;Nobody&apos;ll know the differenceMrs. Lora Rewbush least of
                        all. I don&apos;t think she knows a thing about it, though, of course,
                        she does write splendidly and the words of the pageant are just beautiful.
                        Stand still, Penrod!&quot; (The author of &quot;Harold
                        Ramorez&quot; had moved convulsively.) &quot;Besides, powdered
                        hair&apos;s always becoming. Look at him. You&apos;d hardly know it
                        was Penrod!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The pride and admiration with which she pronounced this undeniable truth
                        might have been thought tactless, but Penrod, not analytical, found his
                        spirits somewhat elevated. No mirror was in his range of vision and, though
                        he had submitted to cursory measurements of his person a week earlier, he
                        had no previous acquaintance with the costume. He began to form a not
                        unpleasing mental picture of his appearance, something somewhere between the
                        portraits of George Washington and a vivid memory of Miss Julia Marlowe at a
                        matine of &quot;Twelfth Night.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He was additionally cheered by a sword which had been borrowed from a
                        neighbour, who was a <pb id="VAA2383-035" n="27"/> Knight of Pythias.
                        Finally there was a mantle, an old golf cape of Margaret&apos;s. Fluffy
                        polka-dots of white cotton had been sewed to it generously; also it was
                        ornamented with a large cross of red flannel, suggested by the picture of a
                        Crusader in a newspaper advertisement. The mantle was fastened to
                        Penrod&apos;s shoulder (that is, to the shoulder of Mrs.
                        Schofield&apos;s ex-bodice) by means of large safety-pins, and arranged
                        to hang down behind him, touching his heels, but obscuring nowise the glory
                        of his faade. Then, at last, he was allowed to step before a mirror.</p>
                    <p>It was a full-length glass, and the worst immediately happened. It might have
                        been a little less violent, perhaps, if Penrod&apos;s expectations had
                        not been so richly and poetically idealized; but as things were, the revolt
                        was volcanic.</p>
                    <p>Victor Hugo&apos;s account of the fight with the devilfish, in
                        &quot;Toilers of the Sea,&quot; encourages a belief that, had Hugo
                        lived and increased in power, he might have been equal to a proper recital
                        of the half hour which followed Penrod&apos;s first sight of himself as
                        the Child Sir Lancelot. But Mr. Wilson himself, dastard but eloquent foe of
                        Harold Ramorez, could not have expressed, with all the vile <pb
                            id="VAA2383-036" n="28"/> dashes at his command, the sentiments which
                        animated Penrod&apos;s bosom when the instantaneous and unalterable
                        conviction descended upon him that he was intended by his loved ones to make
                        a public spectacle of himself in his sister&apos;s stockings and part of
                        an old dress of his mother&apos;s.</p>
                    <p>To him these familiar things were not disguised at all; there seemed no
                        possibility that the whole world would not know them at a glance. The
                        stockings were worse than the bodice. He had been assured that these could
                        not be recognized, but, seeing them in the mirror, he was sure that no human
                        eye could fail at first glance to detect the difference between himself and
                        the former purposes of these stockings. Fold, wrinkle, and void shrieked
                        their history with a hundred tongues, invoking earthquake, eclipse, and blue
                        ruin. The frantic youth&apos;s final submission was obtained only after
                        a painful telephonic conversation between himself and his father, the latter
                        having been called up and upon, by the exhausted Mrs. Schofield, to
                        subjugate his offspring by wire.</p>
                    <p>The two ladies made all possible haste, after this, to deliver Penrod into
                        the hands of Mrs. Lora Rewbush; nevertheless, they found opportunity to
                        exchange <pb id="VAA2383-037" n="29"/> earnest congratulations upon his not
                        having recognized the humble but serviceable paternal garment now brilliant
                        about the Lancelotish middle. Altogether, they felt that the costume was a
                        success. Penrod looked like nothing ever remotely imagined by Sir Thomas
                        Malory or Alfred Tennyson;for that matter, he looked like nothing ever
                        before seen on earth; but as Mrs. Schofield and Margaret took their places
                        in the audience at the Women&apos;s Arts and Guild Hall, the anxiety
                        they felt concerning Penrod&apos;s elocutionary and gesticular powers,
                        so soon to be put to public test, was pleasantly tempered by their
                        satisfaction that, owing to their efforts, his outward appearance would be a
                        credit to the family.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="b">T</hi>HE Child Sir Lancelot found himself in a large anteroom
                        behind the stagea room crowded with excited children, all about equally
                        medieval and artistic. Penrod was less conspicuous than he thought himself,
                        but he was so preoccupied with his own shame, steeling his nerves to meet
                        the first inevitable taunting reference to his sister&apos;s stockings,
                        that he failed to perceive there were others present in much of his own
                        unmanned condition. Retiring to a corner, immediately upon his entrance, he
                        managed to unfasten the mantle <pb id="VAA2383-039" n="31"/> at the
                        shoulders, and, drawing it round him, pinned it again at his throat so that
                        it concealed the rest of his costume. This permitted a temporary relief, but
                        increased his horror of the moment when, in pursuance of the action of the
                        &quot;pageant,&quot; the sheltering garment must be cast aside.</p>
                    <p>Some of the other child knights were also keeping their mantles close about
                        them. A few of the envied opulent swung brilliant fabrics from their
                        shoulders airily, showing off hired splendours from a professional
                        costumer&apos;s stock, while one or two were insulting examples of
                        parental indulgence, particularly little Maurice Levy, the Child Sir
                        Galahad. This shrinking person went clamorously about, making it known
                        everywhere that the best tailor in town had been dazzled by a great sum into
                        constructing his costume. It consisted of blue velvet knickerbockers, a
                        white satin waistcoat, and a beautifully cut little swallow-tailed coat with
                        pearl buttons. The medieval and artistic triumph was completed by a mantle
                        of yellow velvet, and little white boots, sporting gold tassels.</p>
                    <p>All this radiance paused in a brilliant career and addressed the Child Sir
                        Lancelot, gathering an immediately formed semicircular audience of little
                        girls. Woman was ever the trailer of magnificence.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-040" n="32"/>
                    <p>&quot;What <hi rend="i">you</hi> got on?&quot; inquired Mr. Levy,
                        after dispensing information. &quot;What you got on under that ole golf
                        cape?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Penrod looked upon him coldly. At other times his questioner would have
                        approached him with deference, even with apprehension. But to-day the Child
                        Sir Galahad was somewhat intoxicated with the power of his own beauty.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What <hi rend="i">you</hi> got on?&quot; he repeated.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, nothin&apos;,&quot; said Penrod, with an indifference
                        assumed at great cost to his nervous system.</p>
                    <p>The elate Maurice was inspired to set up as a wit. &quot;Then
                        you&apos;re nakid!&quot; he shouted exultantly. &quot;Penrod
                        Schofield says he hasn&apos;t got nothin&apos; on under that ole
                        golf cape! He&apos;s nakid! He&apos;s nakid.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The indelicate little girls giggled delightedly, and a javelin pierced the
                        inwards of Penrod when he saw that the Child Elaine, amber-curled and
                        beautiful Marjorie Jones, lifted golden laughter to the horrid jest.</p>
                    <p>Other boys and girls came flocking to the uproar. &quot;He&apos;s
                        nakid, he&apos;s nakid!&quot; shrieked the Child Sir Galahad.
                        &quot;Penrod Schofield&apos;s nakid! He&apos;s <hi rend="i"
                            >na-a-a-kid!&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>&quot;Hush, hush!&quot; said Mrs. Lora Rewbush, pushing <pb
                            id="VAA2383-041" n="33"/> her way into the group. &quot;Remember, we
                        are all little knights and ladies to-day. Little knights and ladies of the
                        Table Round would not make so much noise. Now children, we must begin to
                        take our places on the stage. Is everybody here?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Penrod made his escape under cover of this diversion: he slid behind Mrs.
                        Lora Rewbush, and being near a, door, opened it unnoticed and went out
                        quickly, closing it behind him. He found himself in a narrow and vacant
                        hallway which led to a door marked &quot;Janitor&apos;s
                        Room.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Burning with outrage, heart-sick at the sweet, cold-blooded laughter of
                        Marjorie Jones, Penrod rested his elbows upon a window-sill and speculated
                        upon the effects of a leap from the second story One of the reasons he gave
                        it up was his desire to live on Maurice Levy&apos;s account: already he
                        was forming educational plans for the Child Sir Galahad.</p>
                    <p>A stout man in blue overalls passed through the hallway muttering to himself
                        petulantly. &quot;I reckon they&apos;ll find that hall hot enough
                            <hi rend="i">now!&quot;</hi> he said, conveying to Penrod an
                        impression that some too feminine women had sent him upon an unreasonable
                        errand to the furnace. He went into the Janitor&apos;s Room and,
                        emerging a moment later, minus the <pb id="VAA2383-042" n="34"/> overalls,
                        passed Penrod again with a bass rumble&quot;Dern &apos;em!&quot;
                        it seemed he saidand made a gloomy exit by the door at the upper end of the
                        hallway.</p>
                    <p>The conglomerate and delicate rustle of a large, mannerly audience was heard
                        as the janitor opened and closed the door; and stage-fright seized the boy.
                        The orchestra began an overture, and, at that, Penrod, trembling violently,
                        tiptoed down the hall into the Janitor&apos;s Room. It was a cul-de-sac:
                        There was no outlet save by the way he had come.</p>
                    <p>Despairingly he doffed his mantle and looked down upon himself for a last
                        sickening assurance that the stockings were as obviously and disgracefully
                        Margaret&apos;s as they had seemed in the mirror at home. For a moment
                        he was encouraged: perhaps he was no worse than some of the other boys. Then
                        he noticed that a safety-pin had opened; one of those connecting the
                        stockings with his trunks. He sat down to fasten it and his eye fell for the
                        first time with particular attention upon the trunks. Until this instant he
                        had been preoccupied with the stockings.</p>
                    <p>Slowly recognition dawned in his eyes.</p>
                    <p>The Schofields&apos; house stood on a corner at the intersection of two
                        main-travelled streets; the fence was low, and the publicity obtained by the
                        washable <pb id="VAA2383-043" n="35"/> portion of the family apparel, on
                        Mondays, had often been painful to Penrod; for boys have a peculiar
                        sensitiveness in these matters. A plain, matter-of-fact washerwoman,
                        employed by Mrs. Schofield, never left anything to the imagination of the
                        passerby; and of all her calm display the scarlet flaunting of his
                        father&apos;s winter wear had most abashed Penrod. One day Marjorie
                        Jones, all gold and starch, had passed when the dreadful things were on the
                        line: Penrod had hidden himself, shuddering. The whole town, he was
                        convinced, knew these garments intimately and derisively.</p>
                    <p>And now, as he sat in the janitor&apos;s chair, the horrible and
                        paralyzing recognition came. He had not an instant&apos;s doubt that
                        every fellow actor, as well as every soul in the audience, would recognize
                        what his mother and sister had put upon him. For as the awful truth became
                        plain to himself it seemed blazoned to the world; and far, far louder than
                        the stockings, the trunks did fairly bellow the grisly secret: <hi rend="i"
                            >whose</hi> they were and WHAT they were!</p>
                    <p>Most people have suffered in a dream the experience of finding themselves
                        very inadequately clad in the midst of a crowd of well-dressed people, and
                        such dreamers&apos; sensations are comparable to Penrod&apos;s, <pb
                            id="VAA2383-044" n="36"/> though faintly, because Penrod was awake and
                        in much too full possession of the most active capacities for anguish.</p>
                    <p>A human male whose dress has been damaged, or reveals some vital lack,
                        suffers from a hideous and shameful loneliness which makes every second
                        absolutely unbearable until he is again as others of his sex and species;
                        and there is no act or sin whatever too desperate for him in his struggle to
                        attain that condition. Also, there is absolutely no embarrassment possible
                        to a woman which is comparable to that of a man under corresponding
                        circumstances; and in this a boy is a man. Gazing upon the ghastly trunks,
                        the stricken Penrod felt that he was a degree worse then nude; and a great
                        horror of himself filled his soul.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Penrod Schofield!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The door into the hallway opened, and a voice demanded him. He could not be
                        seen from the hallway, but the hue and the cry was up; and he knew he must
                        be taken. It was only a question of seconds. He huddled in his chair.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Penrod Schofield!&quot; cried Mrs. Lora Rewbush angrily.</p>
                    <p>The distracted boy rose and, as he did so, a long <pb id="VAA2383-045" n="37"
                        /> pin sank deep into his back. He extracted it frenziedly, which brought to
                        his ears a protracted and sonorous ripping, too easily located by a final
                        gesture of horror.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Penrod Schofield!&quot; Mrs. Lora Rewbush had come out into the
                        hallway.</p>
                    <p>And now, in this extremity, when all seemed lost indeed, particularly
                        including honour, the dilating eye of the outlaw fell upon the blue overalls
                        which the janitor had left hanging upon a peg.</p>
                    <p>Inspiration and action were almost simultaneous.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="b">P</hi>ENROD!&quot; Mrs. Lora Rewbush stood in the doorway,
                        indignantly gazing upon a Child Sir Lancelot mantled to the heels.
                        &quot;Do you know that you have kept an audience of five hundred people
                        waiting for ten minutes?&quot; She, also, detained the five hundred
                        while she spake further.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Penrod contentedly, as he followed her toward
                        the buzzing stage, &quot;I was just sitting there thinking.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Two minutes later the curtain rose on a medieval castle hall richly done in
                        the new stage-craft made <pb id="VAA2383-047" n="39"/> in Germany and
                        consisting of pink and blue cheese-cloth. The Child King Arthur and the
                        Child Queen Guinevere were disclosed upon thrones, with the Child Elaine and
                        many other celebrities in attendance; while about fifteen Child Knights were
                        seated at a dining-room table round, which was covered with a large Oriental
                        rug, and displayed (for the knights&apos; refreshment) a banquet service
                        of silver loving-cups and trophies, borrowed from the Country Club and some
                        local automobile manufacturers.</p>
                    <p>In addition to this splendour, potted plants and palms have seldom been more
                        lavishly used in any castle on the stage or off. The footlights were aided
                        by a &quot;spot-light&quot; from the rear of the hall; and the
                        children were revealed in a blaze of glory.</p>
                    <p>A hushed, multitudinous &quot;O-<hi rend="i">oh&quot;</hi> of
                        admiration from the decorous and delighted audience. Then the children sang
                        feebly:</p>
                    <lg>
                        <l n="1">&quot;Chuldrun of the Tabul Round,</l>

                    </lg>
                    <p>The Child King Arthur rose, extended his sceptre <pb id="VAA2383-048" n="40"
                        /> with the decisive gesture of a semaphore, and spake:</p>
                    <lg>
                        <l n="1">&quot;Each littul knight and lady born</l>
                        <l n="2">Has noble deeds <hi rend="i">to</hi> perform</l>

                        <l n="4">No matter how small his share may be.</l>
                        <l n="5">Let each advance and tell in turn</l>
                        <l n="6">What claim has each to knighthood earn.&quot;</l>
                    </lg>
                    <p>The Child Sir Mordred, the villain of this piece, rose in his place at the
                        table round, and piped the only lines ever written by Mrs. Lora Rewbush
                        which Penrod Schofield could have pronounced without loathing. Georgie
                        Bassett, a really angelic boy, had been selected for the rle of Mordred. His
                        perfect conduct had earned for him the sardonic sobriquet, &quot;The
                        Little Gentleman,&quot; among his boy acquaintances. (Naturally he had
                        no friends.) Hence the other boys supposed that he had been selected for the
                        wicked Mordred as a reward of virtue. He declaimed serenely:</p>
                    <lg>
                        <l n="1">&quot;I hight Sir Mordred the Child, and I teach</l>
                        <l n="2">Lessons of selfishest evil, and reach</l>
                        <l n="3">Out into darkness. Thoughtless, unkind,</l>
                        <l n="4">And ruthless is Mordred, and unrefined.&quot;</l>
                    </lg>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-049" n="41"/>
                    <p>The Child Mordred was properly rebuked and denied the accolade, though, like
                        the others, he seemed to have assumed the title already. He made a
                        plotter&apos;s exit. Whereupon Maurice Levy rose, bowed, announced that
                        he highted the Child Sir Galahad, and continued with perfect <hi rend="i"
                            >sang-frcid:</hi>
                    </p>
                    <lg>
                        <l n="1" rend="ti-1">&quot;I am the purest of the pure.</l>
                        <l n="2">I have but kindest thoughts each day.</l>
                        <l n="3" rend="ti-1">I give my riches to the poor,</l>
                        <l n="4">And follow in the Master&apos;s way.&quot;</l>
                    </lg>
                    <p>This elicited tokens of approval from the Child King Arthur, and he bade
                        Maurice &quot;stand forth&quot; and come near the throne, a command
                        obeyed with the easy grace of conscious merit.</p>
                    <p>It was Penrod&apos;s turn. He stepped back from his chair, the table
                        between him and the audience, and began in a high, breathless monotone:</p>
                    <lg>
                        <l n="1">&quot;I hight Sir Lancelot du Lake, the Child,</l>
                        <l n="2">Gentul-hearted, meek, and mild.</l>
                        <l n="3">What though I&apos;m <hi rend="i">but a</hi> littul child,</l>
                        <l n="4">Gentul-heartud, meek, and mild,</l>
                        <l n="5">I do my share though butthough but&quot;</l>
                    </lg>
                    <p>Penrod paused and gulped. The voice of Mrs. <pb id="VAA2383-050" n="42"/>
                        Lora Rewbush was heard from the wings, prompting irritably, and the Child
                        Sir Lancelot repeated:</p>
                    <lg>
                        <l n="1">&quot;I do my share though butthough but a tot,</l>
                        <l n="2">I pray you knight Sir Lancelot!&quot;</l>
                    </lg>
                    <p>This also met the royal favour, and Penrod was bidden to join Sir Galahad at
                        the throne. As he crossed the stage, Mrs. Schofield whispered to Margaret:</p>
                    <p>&quot;That boy! He&apos;s unpinned his mantle and fixed it to cover
                        his whole costume. After we worked so hard to make it becoming!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Never mind; he&apos;ll have to take the cape off in a
                        minute,&quot; returned Margaret. She leaned forward suddenly, narrowing
                        her eyes to see better. &quot;What <hi rend="i">is</hi> that thing
                        hanging about his left ankle?&quot; she whispered uneasily.
                        &quot;How queer! He must have got tangled in something.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where?&quot; asked Mrs. Schofield, in alarm.</p>
                    <p>&quot;His left foot. It makes him stumble. Don&apos;t you see? It
                        looksit looks like an elephant&apos;s foot!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The Child Sir Lancelot and the Child Sir Galahad clasped hands before their
                        Child King. Penrod was conscious of a great uplift; in a moment he would,
                            <pb id="VAA2383-051" n="43"/> have to throw aside his mantle, but even
                        so he was protected and sheltered in the human garment of a man. His
                        stage-fright had passed, for the audience was but an indistinguishable blur
                        of darkness beyond the dazzling lights. His most repulsive speech (that in
                        which he proclaimed himself a &quot;tot&quot;) was over and done
                        with; and now at last the small, moist hand of the Child Sir Galahad lay
                        within his own. Craftily his brown fingers stole from Maurice&apos;s
                        palm to the wrist. The two boys declaimed in concert:</p>
                    <lg>
                        <l n="1">&quot;We are two chuldrun of the Tabul Round</l>
                        <l n="2" rend="ti-1">Strewing kindness all a-round.</l>
                        <l n="3">With love and good deeds striving ever for the best,</l>
                        <l n="4" rend="ti-1">May our littul efforts e&apos;er be blest.</l>
                        <l n="5">Two littul hearts we offer. See</l>
                        <l n="6">United in love, faith, hope, and char<hi rend="i"
                            >Ow!&quot;</hi>
                        </l>
                    </lg>
                    <p>The conclusion of the duet was marred. The Child Sir Galahad suddenly
                        stiffened, and, uttering an irrepressible shriek of anguish, gave a brief
                        exhibition of the contortionist&apos;s art. (<hi rend="i"
                            >&quot;He&apos;s twistin&apos; my wrist! Dern you,
                            leggo!&quot;</hi>)</p>
                    <p>The voice of Mrs. Lora Rewbush was again heard from the wings; it sounded
                        bloodthirsty. Penrod released his victim; and the Child King Arthur, <pb
                            id="VAA2383-052" n="44"/> somewhat disconcerted, extended his sceptre
                        and, with the assistance of the enraged prompter, said:</p>
                    <lg>
                        <l n="1">&quot;Sweet child-friends of the Tabul Round,</l>
                        <l n="2">In brotherly love and kindness abound,</l>
                        <l n="3" rend="ti-1">Sir Lancelot, you have spoken well,</l>
                        <l n="4" rend="ti-1">Sir Galahad, too, as clear as bell.</l>
                        <l n="5">So now pray doff your mantles gay.</l>
                        <l n="6">You shall be knighted this very day.&quot;</l>
                    </lg>
                    <p>And Penrod doffed his mantle.</p>
                    <p>Simultaneously, a thick and vasty gasp came from the audience, as from five
                        hundred bathers in a wholly unexpected surf. This gasp was punctuated
                        irregularly, over the auditorium, by imperfectly subdued screams both of
                        dismay and incredulous joy, and by two dismal shrieks. Altogether it was an
                        extraordinary sound, a sound never to be forgotten by any one who heard it.
                        It was almost as unforgettable as the sight which caused it; the word
                        &quot;sight&quot; being here used in its vernacular sense, for
                        Penrod, standing unmantled and revealed in all the medieval and artistic
                        glory of the janitor&apos;s blue overalls, falls within its meaning.</p>
                    <p>The janitor was a heavy man, and his overalls, upon Penrod, were merely
                        oceanic. The boy was at once swaddled and lost within their blue gulfs and,
                            <pb id="VAA2383-053" n="45"/> vast saggings; and the left leg, too
                        hastily rolled up, had descended with a distinctively elephantine effect, as
                        Margaret had observed. Certainly, the Child Sir Lancelot was at least a
                        sight.</p>
                    <p>It is probable that a great many in that hall must have had, even then, a
                        consciousness that they were looking on at History in the Making. A supreme
                        act is recognizable at sight: it bears the birthmark of immortality. But
                        Penrod, that marvellous boy, had begun to declaim, even with the gesture of
                        flinging off his mantle for the accolade:</p>
                    <lg>

                    </lg>
                    <p>He finished his speech unheard. The audience had recovered breath, but had
                        lost self-control, and there ensued something later described by a
                        participant as a sort of cultured riot.</p>
                    <p>The actors in the &quot;pageant&quot; were not so dumfounded by
                        Penrod&apos;s costume as might have been expected. A few precocious
                        geniuses perceived that the overalls were the Child Lancelot&apos;s own
                        comment on maternal intentions; and these were profoundly <pb
                            id="VAA2383-054" n="46"/> impressed: they regarded him with the grisly
                        admiration of young and ambitious criminals for a jail-mate about to be
                        distinguished by hanging. But most of the children simply took it to be the
                        case (a little strange, but not startling) that Penrod&apos;s mother had
                        dressed him like thatwhich is pathetic. They tried to go on with the
                        &quot;pageant.&quot;</p>
                    <p>They made a brief, manful effort. But the irrepressible outbursts from the
                        audience bewildered them; every time Sir Lancelot du Lake the Child opened
                        his mouth, the great, shadowy house fell into an uproar, and the children
                        into confusion. Strong women and brave girls in the audience went out into
                        the lobby, shrieking and clinging to one another. Others remained, rocking
                        in their seats, helpless and spent. The neighbourhood of Mrs. Schofield and
                        Margaret became, tactfully, a desert. Friends of the author went behind the
                        scenes and encountered a hitherto unknown phase of Mrs. Lora Rewbush; they
                        said, afterward, that she hardly seemed to know what she was doing. She
                        begged to be left alone somewhere with Penrod Schofield, for just a little
                        while.</p>
                    <p>They led her away.</p>

                        <hi rend="b">T</hi>HE sun was setting behind the back fence (though at a
                        considerable distance) as Penrod Schofield approached that fence and looked
                        thoughtfully up at the top of it, apparently having in mind some purpose to
                        climb up and sit there. Debating this, he passed his fingers gently up and
                        down the backs of his legs; and then something seemed to decide him not to
                        sit anywhere. He leaned against the fence, sighed profoundly, and gazed at
                        Duke, his wistful dog.</p>
                    <p>The sigh was reminiscent: episodes of simple <pb id="VAA2383-056" n="48"/>
                        pathos were passing before his inward eye. About the most painful was the
                        vision of lovely Marjorie Jones, weeping with rage as the Child Sir Lancelot
                        was dragged, insatiate, from the prostrate and howling Child Sir Galahad,
                        after an onslaught delivered the precise instant the curtain began to fall
                        upon the demoralized &quot;pageant.&quot; And thenoh, pangs! oh,
                        woman!she slapped at the ruffian&apos;s cheek, as he was led past her by
                        a resentful janitor; and turning, flung her arms round the Child Sir
                        Galahad&apos;s neck.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">&quot;Penrod Schofield, don&apos;t you dare ever speak
                            to me again as long as you live!&quot;</hi> Maurice&apos;s
                        little white boots and gold tassels had done their work.</p>
                    <p>At home the late Child Sir Lancelot was consigned to a locked clothes-closet
                        pending the arrival of his father. Mr. Schofield came and, shortly after,
                        there was put into practice an old patriarchal custom. It is a custom of
                        inconceivable antiquity: probably primordial, certainly prehistoric, but
                        still in vogue in some remaining citadels of the ancient simplicities of the
                        Republic.</p>
                    <p>And now, therefore, in the dusk, Penrod leaned against the fence and sighed.</p>
                    <p>His case is comparable to that of an adult who <pb id="VAA2383-057" n="49"/>
                        could have survived a similar experience. Looking back to the sawdust-box,
                        fancy pictures this comparable adult a serious and inventive writer engaged
                        in congenial literary activities in a private retreat. We see this period
                        marked by the creation of some of the most virile passages of a Work dealing
                        exclusively in red corpuscles and huge primal impulses. We see this
                        thoughtful man dragged from his calm seclusion to a horrifying publicity;
                        forced to adopt the stage and, himself a writer, compelled to exploit the
                        repulsive sentiments of an author not only personally distasteful to him but
                        whose whole method and school in <hi rend="i">belles lettres</hi> he
                        despises.</p>
                    <p>We see him reduced by desperation and modesty to stealing a pair of overalls.
                        We conceive him to have ruined, then, his own reputation, and to have
                        utterly disgraced his family; next, to have engaged in the <hi rend="i"
                            >duello</hi> and to have been spurned by his lady-love, thus lost to him
                        (according to her own declaration) forever. Finally, we must behold:
                        imprisonment by the authorities; the third degreeand flagellation.</p>
                    <p>We conceive our man deciding that his career had been perhaps too eventful.
                        Yet Penrod had condensed all of it into eight hours.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-058" n="50"/>
                    <p>It appears that he had at least some shadowy perception of a recent fulness
                        of life, for, as he leaned against the fence, gazing upon his wistful Duke,
                        he sighed again and murmured aloud:</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">&quot;Well, hasn&apos;t this been a day!&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>But in a little while a star came out, freshly lighted, from the highest part
                        of the sky, and Penrod, looking up, noticed it casually and a little
                        drowsily. He yawned. Then he sighed once more, but not reminiscently:
                        evening had come; the day was over.</p>
                    <p>It was a sigh of pure <hi rend="i">ennui.</hi>

                    <head type="subtitle">EVILS OF DRINK</head>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="b">N</hi>EXT day, Penrod acquired a dime by a simple and antique
                        process which was without doubt sometimes practised by the boys of Babylon.
                        When the teacher of his class in Sunday-school requested the weekly
                        contribution, Penrod, fumbling honestly (at first) in the wrong pockets,
                        managed to look so embarrassed that the gentle lady told him not to mind,
                        and said she was often forgetful herself. She was so sweet about it that,
                        looking into the future; Penrod began to feel confident of a small but
                        regular income.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-060" n="52"/>
                    <p>At the close of the afternoon services he did not go home, but proceeded to
                        squander the funds just with held from China upon an orgy of the most
                        pungently forbidden description. In a Drug Emporium, near the church, he
                        purchased a five-cent sack of candy consisting for the most part of the
                        heavily flavoured hoofs of horned cattle, but undeniably substantial and so
                        generously capable of resisting solution that the purchaser must needs be
                        avaricious beyond reason who did not realize his money&apos;s worth.</p>
                    <p>Equipped with this collation, Penrod contributed his remaining nickel to a
                        picture show, countenanced upon the seventh day by the legal but not the
                        moral authorities. Here, in cozy darkness, he placidly insulted his liver
                        with jaw-breaker upon jaw-breaker from the paper sack, and in a surfeit of
                        content watched the silent actors on the screen.</p>
                    <p>One film made a lasting impression upon him. It depicted with relentless
                        pathos the drunkard&apos;s progress; beginning with his conversion to
                        beer in the company of loose travelling men; pursuing him through an
                        inexplicable lapse into evening clothes and the society of some remarkably
                        painful ladies, next, exhibiting the effects of alcohol on the
                        victim&apos;s domestic disposition, the unfortunate man was seen <pb
                            id="VAA2383-061" n="53"/> in the act of striking his wife and,
                        subsequently, his pleading baby daughter with an abnormally heavy
                        walking-stick. Their flightthrough the snowto seek the protection of a
                        relative was shown, and finally, the drunkard&apos;s picturesque
                        behaviour at the portals of a madhouse.</p>
                    <p>So fascinated was Penrod that he postponed his departure until this film came
                        round again, by which time he had finished his unnatural repast and almost,
                        but not quite, decided against following the profession of a drunkard when
                        he grew up.</p>
                    <p>Emerging, satiated, from the theatre, a public timepiece before a
                        jeweller&apos;s shop confronted him with an unexpected dial and imminent
                        perplexities. How was he to explain at home these hours of dalliance? There
                        was a steadfast rule that he return direct from Sunday-school; and Sunday
                        rules were important, because on that day there was his father, always at
                        home and at hand, perilously ready for action. One of the hardest conditions
                        of boyhood is the almost continuous strain put upon the powers of invention
                        by the constant and harassing necessity for explanations of every natural
                        act.</p>
                    <p>Proceeding homeward through the deepening twilight as rapidly as possible, at
                        a gait half skip and <pb id="VAA2383-062" n="54"/> half canter, Penrod made
                        up his mind in what manner he would account for his long delay, and, as he
                        drew nearer, rehearsed in words the opening passage of his defence.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now see here,&quot; he determined to begin; &quot;I do not
                        wished to be blamed for things I couldn&apos;t help, nor any other boy.
                        I was going along the street by a cottage and a lady put her head out of the
                        window and said her husband was drunk and whipping her and her little girl,
                        and she asked me wouldn&apos;t I come in and help hold him. So I went in
                        and tried to get hold of this drunken lady&apos;s husband where he was
                        whipping their baby daughter, but he wouldn&apos;t pay any attention,
                        and I <hi rend="i">told</hi> her I ought to be getting home, but she
                        kep&apos; on askin&apos; me to stay&quot;</p>
                    <p>At this point he reached the corner of his own yard, where a coincidence not
                        only checked the rehearsal of his eloquence but happily obviated all
                        occasion for it. A cab from the station drew up in front of the gate, and
                        there descended a troubled lady in black and a fragile little girl about
                        three. Mrs. Schofield rushed from the house and enfolded both in hospitable
                        arms.</p>
                    <p>They were Penrod&apos;s Aunt Clara and cousin, also Clara, from Dayton,
                        Illinois, and in the flurry of <pb id="VAA2383-063" n="55"/> their arrival
                        everybody forgot to put Penrod to the question. It is doubtful, however, if
                        he felt any relief; there may have been even a slight, unconscious
                        disappointment not altogether dissimilar to that of an actor deprived of a
                        good part.</p>
                    <p>In the course of some really necessary preparations for dinner he stepped
                        from the bathroom into the pink-and-white bedchamber of his sister, and
                        addressed her rather thickly through a towel.</p>
                    <p>&quot;When&apos;d mamma find out Aunt Clara and Cousin Clara were
                        coming?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not till she saw them from the window. She just happened to look
                        out as they drove up. Aunt Clara telegraphed this morning, but it
                        wasn&apos;t delivered.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How long they goin&apos; to stay?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Penrod ceased to rub his shining face, and thoughtfully tossed the towel
                        through the bathroom door. &quot;Uncle John won&apos;t try to make
                        &apos;em come back home, I guess, will he?&quot; (Uncle John was
                        Aunt Clara&apos;s husband, a successful manufacturer of stoves, and his
                        lifelong regret was that he had not entered the Baptist ministry.)
                        &quot;He&apos;ll let &apos;em stay here quietly, won&apos;t
                        he?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-064" n="56"/>
                    <p>&quot;What <hi rend="i">are</hi> you talking about?&quot; demanded
                        Margaret, turning from her mirror. &quot;Uncle John sent them here. Why
                        shouldn&apos;t he let them stay?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Penrod looked crestfallen. &quot;Then he hasn&apos;t taken to
                        drink?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Certainly not!&quot; She emphasized the denial with a pretty
                        peal of soprano laughter.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then why,&quot; asked her brother gloomily, &quot;why did
                        Aunt Clara look so worried when she got here?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good gracious! Don&apos;t people worry about anything except
                        somebody&apos;s drinking? Where did you get such an idea?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; he persisted, &quot;you don&apos;t <hi
                            rend="i">know</hi> it ain&apos;t that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She laughed again, whole-heartedly. &quot;Poor Uncle John! He
                        won&apos;t even allow grape juice or ginger ale in his house. They came
                        because they were afraid little Clara might catch the measles.
                        She&apos;s very delicate, and there&apos;s such an epidemic of
                        measles among the children over in Dayton the schools had to be closed.
                        Uncle John got so worried that last night he dreamed about it; and this
                        morning he couldn&apos;t stand it any longer and packed them off over
                        here, though he thinks it&apos;s wicked to travel on Sunday. And Aunt
                        Clara was worried when she got <pb id="VAA2383-065" n="57"/> here because
                        they&apos;d forgotten to check her trunk and it will have to be sent by
                        express. Now what in the name of the common sense put it into your head that
                        Uncle John had taken to&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, nothing.&quot; He turned lifelessly away and went
                        downstairs, a new-born hope dying in his bosom. Life seems so needlessly
                        dull sometimes.</p>

                        <hi rend="b">N</hi>EXT morning, when he had once more resumed the dreadful
                        burden of education, it seemed infinitely duller. And yet what pleasanter
                        sight is there than a schoolroom well filled with children of those
                        sprouting years just before the &apos;teens? The casual visitor, gazing
                        from the teacher&apos;s platform upon these busy little heads, needs
                        only a blunted memory to experience the most agreeable and exhilarating
                        sensations. Still, for the greater part, the children are unconscious of the
                        happiness of their condition; for nothing is more <pb id="VAA2383-067"
                            n="59"/> pathetically true than that we &quot;never know when we are
                        well off.&quot; The boys in a public school are less aware of their
                        happy state than are the girls; and of all the boys in his room, probably
                        Penrod himself had the least appreciation of his felicity.</p>
                    <p>He sat staring at an open page of a textbook, but not studying; not even
                        reading; not even thinking. Nor was he lost in a reverie: his
                        mind&apos;s eye was shut, as his physical eye might well have been, for
                        the optic nerve, flaccid with <hi rend="i">ennui,</hi> conveyed nothing
                        whatever of the printed page upon which the orb of vision was partially
                        focused. Penrod was doing something very unusual and rare, something almost
                        never accomplished except by coloured people or by a boy in school on a
                        spring day: he was doing really nothing at all. He was merely a state of
                        being.</p>
                    <p>From the street a sound stole in through the open window, and abhorring
                        Nature began to fill the vacuum called Penrod Schofield; for the sound was
                        the spring song of a mouth-organ, coming down the sidewalk. The windows were
                        intentionally above the level of the eyes of the seated pupils; but the
                        picture of the musician was plain to Penrod, painted for him by a quality in
                        the runs and trills, partaking of the oboe, of the calliope, and of cats in
                        anguish; <pb id="VAA2383-068" n="60"/> an excruciating sweetness obtained
                        only by wallowing, walloping yellow-pink palm of a hand whose back was Congo
                        black and shiny. The music came down the street and passed beneath the
                        window, accompanied by the care-free shuffling of a pair of old shoes
                        scuffing syncopations on the cement sidewalk. It passed into the distance;
                        became faint and blurred; was gone. Emotion stirred in Penrod a great and
                        poignant desire, but (perhaps fortunately) no fairy godmother made her
                        appearance. Otherwise Penrod would have gone down the street in a black
                        skin, playing the mouth-organ, and an unprepared coloured youth would have
                        found himself enjoying educational advantages for which he had no ambition
                        whatever.</p>
                    <p>Roused from perfect apathy, the boy cast about the schoolroom an eye wearied
                        to nausea by the perpetual vision of the neat teacher upon the platform, the
                        backs of the heads of the pupils in front of him, and the monotonous
                        stretches of blackboard threat-eningly defaced by arithmetical formul and
                        other insignia of torture. Above the blackboard, the walls of the high room
                        were of white plasterwhite with the qualified whiteness of old snow in a
                        soft coal town. This dismal expanse was broken by four <pb id="VAA2383-069"
                            n="61"/> lithographic portraits, votive offerings of a thoughtful
                        publisher. The portraits were of good and great men, kind men; men who loved
                        children. Their faces were noble and benevolent. But the lithographs offered
                        the only rest for the eyes of children fatigued by the everlasting sameness
                        of the school-room. Long day after long day, interminable week in and
                        interminable week out, vast month on vast month, the pupils sat with those
                        four portraits beaming kindness down upon them. The faces became permanent
                        in the consciousness of the children; they became an obsessionin and out of
                        school the children were never free of them. The four faces haunted the
                        minds of children falling asleep; they hung upon the minds of children
                        waking at night; they rose forebodingly in the minds of children waking in
                        the morning; they became monstrously alive in the minds of children lying
                        sick of fever. Never, while the children of that schoolroom lived, would
                        they be able to forget one detail of the four lithographs: the hand of
                        Longfellow was fixed, for them, forever, in his beard. And by a simple and
                        unconscious association of ideas, Penrod Schofield was accumulating an
                        antipathy for the gentle Longfellow and for James Russell Lowell and for
                        Oliver <pb id="VAA2383-070" n="62"/> Wendell Holmes and for John Greenleaf
                        Whittier, which would never permit him to peruse a wors of one of those
                        great New Englanders without a feeling of personal resentment.</p>
                    <p>His eyes fell slowly and inimically from the brow of Whittier to the braid of
                        reddish hair belonging to Victorine Riordan, the little octoroon girl who
                        sat directly in front of him. Victorine&apos;s back was as familiar to
                        Penrod as the necktie of Oliver Wendell Holmes. So was her gayly coloured
                        plaid waist. He hated the waist as he hated Victorine herself, without
                        knowing why. Enforced companionship in large quantities and on an equal
                        basis between the sexes appears to sterilize the affections, and schoolroom
                        romances are few.</p>
                    <p>Victorine&apos;s hair was thick, and the brickish glints in it were
                        beautiful, but Penrod was very tired of it. A tiny knot of green ribbon
                        finished off the braid and kept it from unravelling; and beneath the ribbon
                        there was a final wisp of hair which was just long enough to repose upon
                        Penrod&apos;s desk when Victorine leaned back in her seat. It was there
                        now. Thoughtfully, he took the braid between thumb and forefinger, and,
                        without disturbing Victorine, dipped the end of it and the green ribbon into
                        the ink-well <pb id="VAA2383-071" n="63"/> of his desk. He brought hair and
                        ribbon forth dripping purple ink, and partially dried them on a blotter,
                        though, a moment later when Victorine leaned forward, they were still able
                        to add a few picturesque touches to the plaid waist.</p>
                    <p>Rudolph Krauss, across the aisle from Penrod, watched the operation with
                        protuberant eyes, fascinated. Inspired to imitation, he took a piece of
                        chalk from his pocket and wrote &quot;RATS&quot; across the
                        shoulder-blades of the boy in front of him, then looked across appealingly
                        to Penrod for tokens of <unclear>-ongratulation.</unclear> Penrod yawned. It
                        may not be denied that at times he appeared to be a very self-centred
                    boy.</p>

                        <hi rend="b">H</hi>ALF the members of the class passed out to a
                        recitation-room, the empurpled Victorine among them, and Miss Spence started
                        the remaining half through the ordeal of trial by mathematics. Several boys
                        and girls were sent to the blackboard, and Penrod, spared for the moment,
                        followed their operations a little while with his eyes, but not with his
                        mind; then, sinking deeper in his seat, limply abandoned the effort. His
                        eyes remained open, but saw nothing; the routine of the arithmetic lesson
                        reached his ears in familiar, meaningless <pb id="VAA2383-073" n="65"/>
                        sounds, but he heard nothing; and yet, this time, he was profoundly
                        occupied. He had drifted away from the painful land of facts, and floated
                        now in a new sea of fancy which he had just discovered.</p>
                    <p>Maturity forgets the marvellous realness of a boy&apos;s day-dreams, how
                        colourful they glow, rosy and living, and how opaque the curtain closing
                        down between the dreamer and the actual world. That curtain is almost
                        sound-proof, too, and causes more throat-trouble among parents than is
                        suspected.</p>
                    <p>The nervous monotony of the schoolroom inspires a sometimes unbearable
                        longing for something astonishing to happen, and as every boy&apos;s
                        fundamental desire is to do something astonishing himself, so as to be the
                        centre of all human interest and awe, it was natural that Penrod should
                        discover in fancy the delightful secret of self-levitation. He found, in
                        this curious series of imaginings, during the lesson in arithmetic, that the
                        atmosphere may be navigated as by a swimmer under water, but with infinitely
                        greater ease and with perfect comfort in breathing. In his mind he extended
                        his arms gracefully, at a level with his shoulders, and delicately paddled
                        the air with his hands, which at once caused him to be drawn up out of his
                        seat and elevated gently <pb id="VAA2383-074" n="66"/> to a position about
                        midway between the floor and the ceiling, where he came to an equilibrium
                        and floated; a sensation not the less exquisite because of the screams of
                        his fellow pupils, appalled by the miracle. Miss Spence herself was amazed
                        and frightened, but he only smiled down carelessly upon her when she
                        commanded him to return to earth; and then, when she climbed upon a desk to
                        pull him down, he quietly paddled himself a little higher, leaving his toes
                        just out of her reach. Next, he swam through a few slow somersaults to show
                        his mastery of the new art, and, with the shouting of the dumfounded
                        scholars ringing in his ears, turned on his side and floated swiftly out of
                        the window, immediately rising above the housetops, while people in the
                        street below him shrieked, and a trolley car stopped dead in wonder.</p>
                    <p>With almost no exertion he paddled himself, many yards at a stroke, to the
                        girls&apos; private school where Marjorie Jones was a pupilMarjorie
                        Jones of the amber curls and the golden voice! Long before the
                        &quot;Pageant of the Table Round,&quot; she had offered Penrod a
                        hundred proofs that she considered him wholly undesirable and ineligible. At
                        the Friday Afternoon Dancing Class she consistently incited and <pb
                            id="VAA2383-075" n="67"/> led the laughter at him whenever Professor
                        Bartet singled him out for admonition in matters of feet and decorum. And
                        but yesterday she had chid him for his slavish lack of memory in daring to
                        offer her a greeting on the way to Sunday-school. &quot;Well! I expect
                        you must forgot I told you never to speak to me again! If I was a boy,
                        I&apos;d be too proud to come hanging around people that don&apos;t
                        speak to me, even if I <hi rend="i">was</hi> the Worst Boy in
                        Town!&quot; So she flouted him. But now, as he floated in through the
                        window of her classroom and swam gently along the ceiling like an escaped
                        toy balloon, she fell upon her knees beside her little desk, and, lifting up
                        her arms toward him, cried with love and admiration:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, <hi rend="i">Pen</hi>rod!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He negligently kicked a globe from the high chandelier, and, smiling coldly,
                        floated out through the hall to the front steps of the school, while
                        Marjorie followed, imploring him to grant her one kind look.</p>
                    <p>In the street an enormous crowd had gathered, headed by Miss Spence and a
                        brass band; and a cheer from a hundred thousand throats shook the very
                        ground as Penrod swam overhead. Marjorie knelt upon the steps and watched
                        adoringly while Penrod took the drum-major&apos;s baton and, performing
                        sinuous <pb id="VAA2383-076" n="68"/> evolutions above the crowd, led the
                        band. Then he threw the baton so high that it disappeared from sight; but he
                        went swiftly after it, a double delight, for he had not only the delicious
                        sensation of rocketing safely up and up into the blue sky, but also that of
                        standing in the crowd below, watching and admiring himself as he dwindled to
                        a speck, disappeared and then, emerging from a cloud, came speeding down,
                        with the baton in his hand, to the level of the treetops, where he beat time
                        for the band and the vast throng and Marjorie Jones, who all united in the
                        &quot;Star-spangled Banner&quot; in honour of his aerial
                        achievements. It was a great moment.</p>
                    <p>It was a great moment, but something seemed to threaten it. The face of Miss
                        Spence looking up from the crowd grew too vividunpleasantly vivid. She was
                        beckoning him and shouting, &quot;Come down, Penrod Schofield! Penrod
                        Schofield, come down here!&quot; He could hear her above the band and
                        the singing of the multitude; she seemed intent on spoiling everything.
                        Marjorie Jones was weeping to show how sorry she was that she had formerly
                        slighted him, and throwing kisses to prove that she loved him; but Miss
                        Spence kept jumping between him and Marjorie, incessantly calling his name.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-077" n="69"/>
                    <p>He grew more and more irritated with her; he was the most important person in
                        the world and was engaged in proving it to Marjorie Jones and the whole
                        city, and yet Miss Spence seemed to feel she still had the right to order
                        him about as she did in the old days when he was an ordinary schoolboy. He
                        was furious; he was sure she wanted him to do something disagreeable. It
                        seemed to him that she had screamed &quot;Penrod Schofield!&quot;
                        thousands of times.</p>
                    <p>From the beginning of his aerial experiments in his own schoolroom, he had
                        not opened his lips, knowing somehow that one of the requirements for air
                        floating is perfect silence on the part of the floater; but, finally,
                        irritated beyond measure by Miss Spence&apos;s clamorous insistence, he
                        was unable to restrain an indignant rebukeand immediately came to earth with
                        a frightful bump.</p>
                    <p>Miss Spencein the fleshhad directed toward the physical body of the absent
                        Penrod an inquiry as to the fractional consequences of dividing seventeen
                        apples, fairly, among three boys, and she was surprised and displeased to
                        receive no answer although to the best of her knowledge and belief, he was
                        looking fixedly at her. She repeated her question crisply, without visible
                        effect; then summoned him by name <pb id="VAA2383-078" n="70"/> with
                        increasing asperity. Twice she called him, while all his fellow pupils
                        turned to stare at the gazing boy. She advanced a step from the platform.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Penrod Schofield!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, my goodness!&quot; he shouted suddenly.
                        &quot;Can&apos;t you keep still a <hi rend="i"
                        >minute?&quot;</hi>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="b">M</hi>ISS SPENCE gasped. So did the pupils. The whole room
                        filled with a swelling conglomerate <hi rend="i"
                            >&quot;O-o-o-o-h!&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>As for Penrod himself, the walls reeled with the shock. He sat with his mouth
                        open, a mere lump of stupefaction. For the appalling words that he had
                        hurled at the teacher were as inexplicable to him as to any other who heard
                        them.</p>
                    <p>Nothing is more treacherous than the human mind; nothing else so loves to
                        play the Iscariot. Even when patiently bullied into a semblance of order and
                            <pb id="VAA2383-080" n="72"/> training, it may prove but a base and
                        shifty servant. And Penrod&apos;s mind was not his servant; it was a
                        master, with the April wind&apos;s whims; and it had just played him a
                        diabolical trick. The very jolt with which he came back to the schoolroom in
                        the midst of his fancied flight jarred his day-dream utterly out of him; and
                        he sat, open-mouthed in horror at what he had said.</p>
                    <p>The unanimous gasp of awe was protracted. Miss Spence, however, finally
                        recovered her breath, and, returning deliberately to the platform, faced the
                        school. &quot;And then, for a little while,&quot; as pathetic
                        stories sometimes recount, &quot;everything was very still.&quot; It
                        was so still, in fact, that Penrod&apos;s newborn notoriety could almost
                        be heard growing. This grisly silence was at last broken by the teacher.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Penrod Schofield, stand up!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The miserable child obeyed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What did you mean by speaking to me in that way?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He hung his head, raked the floor with the side of his shoe, swayed,
                        swallowed, looked suddenly at his hands with the air of never having seen
                        them before, then clasped them behind him. The school shivered in ecstatic
                        horror, every fascinated eye upon <pb id="VAA2383-081" n="73"/> him; yet
                        there was not a soul in the room but was profoundly grateful to him for the
                        sensationincluding the offended teacher herself. Unhappily, all this
                        gratitude was unconscious and altogether different from the kind which
                        results in testimonials and loving-cups. On the contrary!</p>
                    <p>&quot;Penrod Schofield!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He gulped.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Answer me at once! Why did you speak to me like that?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I was&quot; He choked, unable to continue.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Speak out!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I was justthinking,&quot; he managed to stammer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That will not do,&quot; she returned sharply. &quot;I wish
                        to know immediately why you spoke as you did.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The stricken Penrod answered helplessly: &quot;Because I was just
                        thinking.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Upon the very rack he could have offered no ampler truthful explanation. It
                        was all he knew about it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thinking what?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just thinking.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Miss Spence&apos;s expression gave evidence that her power of
                        self-restraint was undergoing a remarkable test. However, after taking
                        counsel with herself, she commanded:</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-082" n="74"/>
                    <p>&quot;Come here!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He shuffled forward, and she placed a chair upon the platform near her own.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sit there!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Then (but not at all as if nothing had happened, she continued the lesson in
                        arithmetic. Spiritually the children may have learned a lesson in very small
                        fractions indeed as they gazed at the fragment of sin before them on the
                        stool of penitence. They all stared at him attentively with hard and
                        passionately interested eyes, in which there was never one trace of pity. It
                        cannot be said with precision that he writhed; his movement was more a slow,
                        continuous squirm, effected with a ghastly assumption of languid
                        indifference; while his gaze, in the effort to escape the marble-hearted
                        glare of his schoolmates, affixed itself with apparent permanence to the
                        waist-coat button of James Russell Lowell just above the
                        &quot;U&quot; in &quot;Russell.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Classes came and classes went, grilling him with eyes. Newcomers received the
                        story of the crime in darkling whispers; and the outcast sat and sat and
                        sat, and squirmed and squirmed and squirmed. (He did one or two things with
                        his spine which a professional contortionist would have observed <pb
                            id="VAA2383-083" n="[75]"/>

                        <pb id="VAA2383-084" n="76"/> with real interest.) And all this while of
                        freezing suspense was but the criminal&apos;s detention awaiting trial.
                        A known punishment may be anticipated with some measure of equanimity; at
                        least, the prisoner may prepare himself to undergo it; but the unknown looms
                        more monstrous for every attempt to guess it. Penrod&apos;s crime was
                        unique; there were no rules to aid him in estimating the vengeance to fall
                        upon him for it. What seemed most probable was that he would be expelled
                        from the schools in the presence of his family, the mayor, and council, and
                        afterward whipped by his father upon the State House steps, with the entire
                        city as audience by invitation of the authorities.</p>
                    <p>Noon came. The rows of children filed out, every head turning for a last
                        unpleasingly speculative look at the outlaw. Then Miss Spence closed the
                        door into the cloakroom and that into the big hall, and came and sat at her
                        desk, near Penrod. The tramping of feet outside, the shrill calls and
                        shouting and the changing voices of the older boys ceased to be heardand
                        there was silence. Penrod, still affecting to be occupied with Lowell, was
                        conscious that Miss Spence looked at him intently.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Penrod,&quot; she said gravely, &quot;what excuse have <pb
                            id="VAA2383-085" n="77"/> you to offer before I report your case to the
                        principal?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The word &quot;principal&quot; struck him to the vitals. Grand
                        Inquisitor, Grand Khan, Sultan, Emperor, Tsar, Csar Augustusthese are
                        comparable. He stopped squirming instantly, and sat rigid.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I want an answer. Why did you shout those words at me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; he murmured, &quot;I was
                        justthinking.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thinking what?&quot; she asked sharply.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That won&apos;t do!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He took his left ankle in his right hand and regarded it helplessly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That won&apos;t do, Penrod Schofield,&quot; she repeated
                        severely. &quot;If that is all the excuse you have to offer I shall
                        report your case this instant!&quot;</p>
                    <p>And she rose with fatal intent.</p>
                    <p>But Penrod was one of those whom the precipice inspires. &quot;Well, I
                            <hi rend="i">have</hi> got an excuse.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well&quot;she paused impatiently&quot;what is it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He had not an idea, but he felt one coming, and replied automatically, in a
                        plaintive tone: &quot;I guess anybody that had been through what <hi
                            rend="i">I</hi>
                        <pb id="VAA2383-086" n="78"/> had to go through, last night, would think
                        they had an excuse.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Miss Spence resumed her seat, though with the air of being ready to leap from
                        it instantly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What has last night to do with your insolence to me this
                        morning?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I guess you&apos;d see,&quot; he returned,
                        emphasizing the plaintive note, &quot;if you knew what <hi rend="i"
                        >I</hi> know.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, Penrod,&quot; she said, in a kinder voice, &quot;I
                        have a high regard for your mother and father, and it would hurt me to
                        distress them, but you must either tell me what was the matter with you or
                        I&apos;ll have to take you to Mrs. Houston.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, ain&apos;t I going to?&quot; he cried, spurred by the
                        dread name. &quot;It&apos;s because I didn&apos;t sleep last
                        night.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Were you ill?&quot; The question was put with some dryness.</p>
                    <p>He felt the dryness. &quot;No&apos;m; <hi rend="i">I</hi>
                        wasn&apos;t.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then if someone in your family was so ill that even you were kept
                        up all night, how does it happen they let you come to school this
                        morning?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It wasn&apos;t illness,&quot; he returned, shaking his head
                        mournfully. &quot;It was lots worse&apos;n anybody&apos;s being
                        sick. It wasit waswell, it was jest awful.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-087" n="79"/>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">What</hi> was?&quot; He remarked with anxiety the
                        incredulity in her tone.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It was about Aunt Clara,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Your Aunt Clara!&quot; she repeated. &quot;Do you mean your
                        mother&apos;s sister who married Mr. Farry of Dayton,
                        Illinois?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;YesUncle John,&quot; returned Penrod sorrowfully. &quot;The
                        trouble was about him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Miss Spence frowned a frown which he rightly interpreted as one of continued
                        suspicion. &quot;She and I were in school together,&quot; she said.
                        &quot;I used to know her very well, and I&apos;ve always heard her
                        married life was entirely happy. I don&apos;t&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, it was,&quot; he interrupted,&quot; until last year
                        when Uncle John took to running with travelling men&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes&apos;m.&quot; He nodded solemnly. &quot;That was
                        what started it. At first he was a good, kind husband, but these travelling
                        men would coax him into a saloon on his way from work, and they got him to
                        drinking beer and then ales, wines, liquors, and cigars&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Penrod!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ma&apos;am?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m not inquiring into your Aunt Clara&apos;s private

                        have anything to say which would palliate&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s what I&apos;m tryin&apos; to <hi rend="i"
                            >tell</hi> you about, Miss Spence,&quot; he pleaded,&quot;if
                        you&apos;d jest only let me. When Aunt Clara and her little baby
                        daughter got to our house last night&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You say Mrs. Farry is visiting your mother?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes&apos;mnot just visitingyou see, she <hi rend="i">had</hi>
                        to come. Well of course, little baby Clara, she was so bruised up and
                        mauled, where he&apos;d been hittin&apos; her with his
                        cane&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You mean that your uncle had done such a thing as <hi rend="i"
                            >that!&quot;</hi> exclaimed Miss Spence, suddenly disarmed by this
                        scandal.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes&apos;m, and mamma and Margaret had to sit up all night

                            rend="i">her,</hi> and there wasn&apos;t anybody but me to do it, so
                        I&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But where was your father?&quot; she cried.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ma&apos;am?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where was your father while&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ohpapa?&quot; Penrod paused, reflected; then brightened.
                        &quot;Why, he was down at the train, waitin&apos; to see if Uncle
                        John would try to follow &apos;em and make &apos;em come home
                        so&apos;s he could persecute &apos;em <pb id="VAA2383-089" n="81"/>
                        some more. I wanted to do that, but they said if he did come I
                        mightn&apos;t be strong enough to hold him, and&quot; The brave lad
                        paused again, modestly. Miss Spence&apos;s expression was encouraging.
                        Her eyes were wide with astonishment, and there may have been in them, also,
                        the mingled beginnings of admiration and self-reproach. Penrod, warming to
                        his work, felt safer every moment.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And so,&quot; he continued, &quot;I had to sit up with Aunt
                        Clara. She had some pretty big bruises, too, and I had to&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But why didn&apos;t they send for a doctor?&quot; However,
                        this question was only a flicker of dying incredulity.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, they didn&apos;t want any <hi rend="i"
                        >doctor,</hi>&quot; exclaimed the inspired realist promptly.
                        &quot;They don&apos;t want anybody to <hi rend="i">hear</hi> about
                        it because Uncle John might reformand then where&apos;d he be if
                        everybody knew he&apos;d been a drunkard and whipped his wife and baby
                        daughter?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh!&quot; said Miss Spence.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You see, he used to be upright as anybody,&quot; he went on
                        explanatively. &quot;It all begun&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Began, Penrod.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes&apos;m. It all commenced from the first day he let those
                        travelling men coax him into the saloon.&quot; <pb id="VAA2383-090"
                            n="82"/> Penrod narrated the downfall of his Uncle John at length. In
                        detail he was nothing short of plethoric; and incident followed incident,
                        sketched with such vividness, such abundance of colour, and such
                        verisimilitude to a drunkard&apos;s life as a drunkard&apos;s life
                        should be, that had Miss Spence possessed the rather chilling attributes of
                        William J. Burns himself, the last trace of skepticism must have vanished
                        from her mind. Besides, there are two things that will be believed of any
                        man whatsoever, and one of them is that he has taken to drink. And in every
                        sense it was a moving picture which, with simple but eloquent words, the
                        virtuous Penrod set before his teacher.</p>
                    <p>His eloquence increased with what it fed on; and as with the eloquence so
                        with self-reproach in the gentle bosom of the teacher. She cleared her
                        throat with difficulty once or twice, during his description of his
                        ministering night with Aunt Clara. &quot;And I said to her,
                        &apos;Why, Aunt Clara, what&apos;s the use of takin&apos; on so
                        about it?&apos; And I said, &apos;Now, Aunt Clara, all the crying in
                        the world can&apos;t make things any better.&apos; And then
                        she&apos;d just keep catchin&apos; hold of me, and sob and kind of
                        holler, and I&apos;d say, <hi rend="i">&apos;Don&apos;t</hi>
                        cry, Aunt Clara<hi rend="i">please</hi> don&apos;t
                        cry.&apos;&quot;</p>
                    <p>Then, under the influence of some fragmentary <pb id="VAA2383-091" n="83"/>
                        survivals of the respectable portion of his Sunday adventures, his theme
                        became more exalted; and, only partially misquoting a phrase from a psalm,
                        he related how he had made it of comfort to Aunt Clara, and how he had
                        besought her to seek Higher guidance in her trouble.</p>
                    <p>The surprising thing about a structure such as Penrod was erecting is that
                        the taller it becomes the more ornamentation it will stand. Gifted boys have
                        this faculty of building magnificence upon cobwebsand Penrod was gifted.
                        Under the spell of his really great performance, Miss Spence gazed more and
                        more sweetly upon the prodigy of spiritual beauty and goodness before her,
                        until at last, when Penrod came to the explanation of his &quot;just
                        thinking,&quot; she was forced to turn her head away.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You mean, dear,&quot; she said gently, &quot;that you were
                        all worn out and hardly knew what you were saying?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes&apos;m.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And you were thinking about all those dreadful things so hard that
                        you forgot where you were?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I was thinking,&quot; he said simply, &quot;how to save
                        Uncle John.&quot;</p>
                    <p>And the end of it for this mighty boy was that the teacher kissed him!</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="b">T</hi>HE returning students, that afternoon, observed that
                        Penrod&apos;s desk was vacantand nothing could have been more impressive
                        than that sinister mere emptiness. The accepted theory was that Penrod had
                        been arrested. How breathtaking, then, the sensation when, at the beginning
                        of the second hour, he strolled in with inimitable carelessness and, rubbing
                        his eyes, somewhat noticeably in the manner of one who has snatched an hour
                        of much needed sleep, took his place as if nothing in particular had
                        happened. This, at first supposed <pb id="VAA2383-093" n="85"/> to be a
                        superhuman exhibition of sheer audacity, became but the more dumfounding
                        when Miss Spencelooking up from her deskgreeted him with a pleasant little
                        nod. Even after school, Penrod gave numerous maddened investigators no
                        relief. All he would consent to say was: &quot;Oh, I just <hi rend="i"
                            >talked</hi> to her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>A mystification not entirely unconnected with the one thus produced was
                        manifested at his own family dinner-table the following evening. Aunt Clara
                        had been out rather late, and came to the table after the rest were seated.
                        She wore a puzzled expression.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you ever see Mary Spence nowadays?&quot; she inquired, as
                        she unfolded her napkin, addressing Mrs. Schofield. Penrod abruptly set down
                        his soupspoon and gazed at his aunt with flattering attention.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes; sometimes,&quot; said Mrs. Schofield.
                        &quot;She&apos;s Penrod&apos;s teacher.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is she?&quot; said Mrs. Farry. &quot;Do you&quot; She
                        paused. &quot;Do people think her a littlequeer, these days?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, no,&quot; returned her sister. &quot;What makes you
                        say that?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She has acquired a very odd manner,&quot; said Mrs. Farry
                        decidedly. &quot;At least, she seemed odd to <hi rend="i">me.</hi>
                        <pb id="VAA2383-094" n="86"/> I met her at the corner just before I got to
                        the house, a few minutes ago, and after we&apos;d said howdy-do to each
                        other, she kept hold of my hand and looked as though she was going to cry.
                        She seemed to be trying to say something, and choking&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I don&apos;t think that&apos;s so very queer, Clara.
                        She knew you in school, didn&apos;t she?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, but&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And she hadn&apos;t seen you for so many years, I think
                        it&apos;s perfectly natural she&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wait! She stood there squeezing my hand, and struggling to get her
                        voiceand I got really embarrassedand then finally she said, in a kind of
                        tearful whisper, &apos;Be of good cheerthis trial will
                        pass!&apos;&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How queer!&quot; exclaimed Margaret.</p>
                    <p>Penrod sighed, and returned somewhat absently to his soup.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I don&apos;t know,&quot; said Mrs. Schofield thought
                        fully. &quot;Of course she&apos;s heard about the outbreak of
                        measles in Dayton, since they had to close the schools, and she knows you
                        live there&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But doesn&apos;t it seem a <hi rend="i">very</hi> exaggerated
                        way,&quot; suggested Margaret, &quot;to talk about
                        measles?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-095" n="87"/>
                    <p>&quot;Wait!&quot; begged Aunt Clara. &quot;After she said that,
                        she said something even queerer, and then put her handkerchief to her eyes
                        and hurried away.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Penrod laid down his spoon again and moved his chair slightly back from the
                        table. A spirit of prophecy was upon him: he knew that someone was going to
                        ask a question which he felt might better remain unspoken.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What <hi rend="i">was</hi> the other thing she said?&quot; Mr
                        Schofield inquired, thus immediately fulfilling his son&apos;s
                        premonition.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She said,&quot; returned Mrs. Farry slowly, looking about the
                        table, &quot;she said, &apos;I know that Penrod is a great, great
                        comfort to you!&apos;&quot;</p>
                    <p>There was a general exclamation of surprise. It was a singular thing, and in
                        no manner may it be considered complimentary to Penrod, that this speech of
                        Miss Spence&apos;s should have immediately confirmed Mrs.
                        Farry&apos;s doubts about her in the minds of all his family.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Schofield shook his head pityingly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m afraid she&apos;s a goner,&quot; he went so
                        far as to say.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of all the weird ideas!&quot; cried Margaret.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I never heard anything like it in my life!&quot; Mrs. Schofield
                        exclaimed. &quot;Was that <hi rend="i">all</hi> she said?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-096" n="88"/>
                    <p>&quot;Every word!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Penrod again resumed attention to his soup. His mother looked at him
                        curiously, and then, struck by a sudden thought, gathered the glances of the
                        adults of the table by a significant movement of the head, and, by another,
                        conveyed an admonition to drop the subject until later. Miss Spence was
                        Penrod&apos;s teacher: it was better, for many reasons, not to discuss
                        the subject of her queerness before him. This was Mrs. Schofield&apos;s
                        thought at the time. Later she had another, and it kept her awake.</p>
                    <p>The next afternoon, Mr. Schofield, returning at five o&apos;clock from
                        the cares of the day, found the house deserted, and sat down to read his
                        evening paper in what appeared to be an uninhabited apartment known to its
                        own world as the &quot;drawing-room.&quot; A sneeze, unexpected both
                        to him and the owner, informed him of the presence of another person.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where are you, Penrod?&quot; the parent asked, looking about.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Here,&quot; said Penrod meekly.</p>
                    <p>Stooping, Mr. Schofield discovered his son squatting under the piano, near an
                        open windowhis wistful Duke lying beside him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What are you doing there?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-097" n="89"/>
                    <p>&quot;Me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why under the piano?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; the boy returned, with grave sweetness, &quot;I
                        was just kind of sitting herethinking.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right&quot; Mr. Schofield, rather touched, returned to the
                        digestion of a murder, his back once more to the piano; and Penrod silently
                        drew from beneath his jacket (where he had slipped it simultaneously with
                        the sneeze) a paper-backed volume entitled: &quot;Slimsy, the Sioux City
                        Squealer, or, &apos;Not Guilty, Your Honor.&apos;&quot;</p>
                    <p>In this manner the reading-club continued in peace, absorbed, contented, the
                        world well forgotuntil a sudden, violently irritated slam-bang of the front
                        door startled the members; and Mrs. Schofield burst into the room and threw
                        herself into a chair. moaning.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s the matter, mamma?&quot; asked her husband
                        laying aside his paper.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Henry Passloe Schofield,&quot; returned the lady, &quot;I
                        don&apos;t know what <hi rend="i">is</hi> to be done with that boy; I do
                            <hi rend="i">not!&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>&quot;You mean Penrod?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who else could I mean?&quot; She sat up, exasperated, to stare
                        at him. &quot;Henry Passloe Schofield, <pb id="VAA2383-098" n="90"/>
                        you&apos;ve got to take this matter in your handsit&apos;s beyond
                        me!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, what has he&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Last night I got to thinking,&quot; she began rapidly,
                        &quot;about what Clara told usthank Heaven she and Margaret and little
                        Clara have gone to tea at Cousin Charlotte&apos;s!but they&apos;ll

                    <p>&quot;You mean about Penrod&apos;s being a comfort?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, and I kept thinking and thinking and thinking about it till I
                        couldn&apos;t stand it any&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;By <hi rend="i">George!&quot;</hi> shouted Mr. Schofield
                        startlingly, stooping to look under the piano. A statement that he had
                        suddenly remembered his son&apos;s presence would be lacking in
                        accuracy, for the highly sensitized Penrod was, in fact, no longer present.
                        No more was Duke, his faithful dog.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s the matter?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nothing,&quot; he returned, striding to the open window and
                        looking out. &quot;Go on.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; she moaned, &quot;it must be kept from Claraand
                        I&apos;ll never hold up my head again if John Farry ever hears of
                        it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hears of <hi rend="i">what?</hi>&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I just couldn&apos;t stand it, I got so curious; <pb
                            id="VAA2383-099" n="91"/> and I thought of course if Miss Spence <hi
                            rend="i">had</hi> become a little unbalanced it was my duty to know it,
                        as Penrod&apos;s mother and she his teacher; so I thought I would just
                        call on her at her apartment after school and have a chat and seeand I did
                        andoh&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve just come from there, and she told meshe told me! Oh,
                        I&apos;ve <hi rend="i">never</hi> known anything like this!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">What</hi> did she tell you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Schofield, making a great effort, managed to assume a temporary
                        appearance of calm. &quot;Henry,&quot; she said solemnly,
                        &quot;bear this in mind: whatever you do to Penrod, it must be done in
                        some place when Clara won&apos;t hear it. But the first thing to do is
                        to find him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Within view of the window from which Mr. Schofield was gazing was the closed
                        door of the storeroom in the stable, and just outside this door Duke was
                        performing a most engaging trick.</p>
                    <p>His young master had taught Duke to &quot;sit up and beg&quot; when
                        he wanted anything, and if that didn&apos;t get it, to
                        &quot;speak.&quot; Duke was facing the closed door and sitting up
                        and begging, and now he also spokein a loud, clear bark.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-100" n="92"/>
                    <p>There was an open transom over the door, and from this descendedhurled by an
                        unseen agencya can half filled with old paint.</p>
                    <p>It caught the small besieger of the door on his thoroughly surprised right
                        ear, encouraged him to some remarkable acrobatics, and turned large portions
                        of him a dull blue. Allowing only a moment to perplexity, and deciding,
                        after a single and evidently unappetizing experiment, not to cleanse himself
                        of paint, the loyal animal resumed his quaint, upright posture.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Schofield seated himself on the window-sill, whence he could keep in view
                        that pathetic picture of unrequited love.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Go on with your story, mamma,&quot; he said. &quot;I think
                        I can find Penrod when we want him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>And a few minutes later he added, &quot;And I think I know the place to
                        do it in.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Again the faithful voice of Duke was heard, pleading outside the bolted
                    door.</p>

                    <p>Round and round the ballroom went the seventeen struggling little couples of
                        the Friday Afternoon Dancing Class. Round and round went their reflections
                        with them, swimming rhythmically in the polished, dark floorwhite and blue
                        and pink for <pb id="VAA2383-102" n="94"/> the girls; black, with dabs of
                        white, for the white-collared, white-gloved boys; and sparks and slivers of
                        high light everywhere as the glistening pumps flickered along the surface
                        like a school of flying fish. Every small pink facewith one exceptionwas
                        painstaking and set for duty. It was a conscientious little merry-go-round.</p>

                        mannerss of good societies as to dance. You think you shall ever see a
                        gentleman in good societies to tickle his partner in the dance till she say
                        Ouch? Never! I assure you it is not done. Again! Now then! Piano, please!

                    <p>&quot;Pickin&apos; on me again!&quot; murmured the smouldering
                        Penrod to his small, unsympathetic partner. &quot;Can&apos;t let me

                    <p>&quot;Mister Georgie Bassett, please step to the centre,&quot; said
                        the professor.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Bassett complied with modest alacrity.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Teacher&apos;s pet!&quot; whispered Penrod hoarsely. He had
                        nothing but contempt for Georgie Bassett. The parents, guardians, aunts,
                        uncles, cousins, governesses, housemaids, cooks, chauffeurs and coachmen,
                        appertaining to the members of the dancing class, all dwelt in the same part
                        of town and shared certain communal theories; and among the most firmly
                        established was that which maintained Georgie Bassett to be the Best Boy in
                        Town. Contrariwise, the unfortunate Penrod, largely because of his recent
                        dazzling but disastrous attempts to control forces far beyond him, had been
                        given a clear title as the Worst Boy in Town. (Population, 135,000.) To
                        precisely what degree his reputation was the <pb id="VAA2383-104" n="96"/>
                        product of his own energies cannot be calculated. It was Marjorie Jones who
                        first applied the description, in its definite simplicity, the day after the
                        &quot;pageant,&quot; and, possibly, her frequent and effusive
                        repetitions of it, even upon wholly irrelevant occasions, had something to
                        do with its prompt and quite perfect acceptance by the community.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Miss Rennsdale will please do me the fafer to be Mr. Georgie
                        Bassett&apos;s partner for one moment,&quot; said Professor Bartet.
                        &quot;Mr. Penrod Schofield will please give his attention. Miss
                        Rennsdale and Mister Bassett, obliche me, if you please. Others please
                        watch. Piano, please! Now then!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Miss Rennsdale, aged eightthe youngest lady in the classand Mr. Georgie
                        Bassett one-two-three-glided with consummate technique for the better
                        education of Penrod Schofield. It is possible that amber-curled, beautiful
                        Marjorie felt that she, rather than Miss Rennsdale, might have been selected
                        as the example of perfectionor perhaps her remark was only woman.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Stopping everybody for that boy!&quot; said Marjorie.</p>
                    <p>Penrod, across the circle from her, heard distinctlynay, he was obviously
                        intended to hear; but over a scorched heart he preserved a stoic front.
                        Where-upon <pb id="VAA2383-105" n="97"/> Marjorie whispered derisively in
                        the ear of her partner, Maurice Levy, who wore a pearl pin in his tie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Again, please, everybodyladies and gentle-men!&quot; cried
                        Professor Bartet. &quot;Mister Penrod Schofield, if you please, pay
                        puttickly attention! Piano, please! Now then!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The lesson proceeded. At the close of the hour Professor Bartet stepped to
                        the centre of the room and clapped his hands for attention.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, if you please to seat yourselves
                        quietly,&quot; he said; &quot;I speak to you now about to-morrow. As
                        you all knowMister Penrod Schofield, I am not sticking up in a tree outside
                        that window! If you do me the fafer to examine I am here, insides of the
                        room. Now then! Piano, plno, I do not wish the piano! As you all know, this
                        is the last lesson of the season until next October. To-morrow is our
                        special afternoon; beginning three o&apos;clock, we dance the cotillon.
                        But this afternoon comes the test of mannerss. You must see if each know how
                        to make a little formal call like a grown-up people in good societies. You
                        have had good, perfect instruction; let us see if we know how to perform
                        like societies ladies and gentlemen twenty-six years of age.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-106" n="98"/>
                    <p>&quot;Now, when you&apos;re dismissed each lady will go to her home
                        and prepare to receive a call. The gentlemen will allow the ladies time to
                        reach their houses and to prepare to receive callers; then each gentleman
                        will call upon a lady and beg the pleasure to engage her for a partner in
                        the cotillon to-morrow. You all know the correct, proper form for these
                        calls, because didn&apos;t I work teaching you last lesson till I
                        thought I would drop dead? Yes! Now each gentleman, if he reach a
                        lady&apos;s house behind some-other gentleman, then he must go somewhere
                        else to a lady&apos;s house, and keep calling until he secures a
                        partner; so, as there are the same number of both, everybody shall have a
                        partner.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now please all remember that if in caseMister Penrod Schofield,
                        when you make your call on a lady I beg you to please remember that
                        gentlemen in good societies do not scratch the back in societies as you
                        appear to attempt; so please allow the hands to rest carelessly in the lap.
                        Now please all remember that if in caseMister Penrod Schofield, if you
                        please! Gentlemen in societies do not scratch the back by causing frictions
                        between it and the back of your chair, either! Nobody else is itching here!
                            <hi rend="i">I</hi> do not itch! I cannot talk if you must <pb
                            id="VAA2383-107" n="99"/> itch! In the name of Heaven, why must you
                        always itch? What was I saying? Whereah! the cotillonyes! For the cotillon
                        it is important nobody shall fail to be here to-morrow; but if any one
                        should be so very ill he cannot possible come he must write a very polite
                        note of regrets in the form of good societies to his engaged partner to
                        excuse himselfand he must give the reason.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I do not think anybody is going to be that sick to-morrowno; and I
                        will find out and report to parents if anybody would try it and not be. But
                        it is important for the cotillon that we have an even number of so many
                        couples, and if it should happen that someone comes and her partner has sent
                        her a polite note that he has genuine reasons why he cannot come, the note
                        must be handed at once to me, so that I arrange some other partner. Is all
                        understood? Yes. The gentlemen will remember now to allow the ladies plenty
                        of time to reach their houses and prepare to receive calls. Ladies and
                        gentlemen, I thank you for your polite attention.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It was nine blocks to the house of Marjorie Jones; but Penrod did it in less
                        than seven minutes from a flying startsuch was his haste to lay himself and
                        his hand for the cotillon at the feet of one who had <pb id="VAA2383-108"
                            n="100"/> so recently spoken unamiably of him in public. He had not yet
                        learned that the only safe male rebuke to a scornful female is to stay away
                        from herespecially if that is what she desires. However, he did not wish to
                        rebuke her; simply and ardently he wished to dance the cotillon with her.
                        Resentment was swallowed up in hope.</p>
                    <p>The fact that Miss Jones&apos; feeling for him bore a striking
                        resemblance to that of Simon Legree for Uncle Tom, deterred him not at all.
                        Naturally, he was not wholly unconscious that when he should lay his hand
                        for the cotillon at her feet it would be her inward desire to step on it;
                        but he believed that if he were first in the field Marjorie would have to
                        accept. These things are governed by law.</p>
                    <p>It was his fond intention to reach her house even in advance of herself, and
                        with grave misgiving he beheld a large automobile at rest before the sainted
                        gate. Forthwith, a sinking feeling became a portent inside him as little
                        Maurice Levy emerged from the front door of the house.</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;Lo, Penrod!&quot; said Maurice airily.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What you doin&apos; in there?&quot; inquired Penrod.</p>
                    <p>&quot;In where?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;In Marjorie&apos;s.&quot;</p>

                    <p>&quot;Well, what shouldn&apos;t I be doin&apos; in
                        Marjorie&apos;s?&quot; Mr. Levy returned indignantly. &quot;I
                        was inviting her for my partner in the cotillonwhat you
                        s&apos;pose?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You haven&apos;t got any right to!&quot; Penrod protested
                        hotly. &quot;You can&apos;t do it yet.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I did do it yet!&quot; said Maurice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You can&apos;t!&quot; insisted Penrod. &quot;You got to
                        allow them time first. He said the ladies had to be allowed time to
                        prepare.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, ain&apos;t she had time to prepare?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;When?&quot; Penrod demanded, stepping close to his rival
                        threateningly. &quot;I&apos;d like to know when&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;When?&quot; echoed the other with shrill triumph.
                        &quot;When? Why, in mamma&apos;s sixty-horse powder limousine
                        automobile, what Marjorie came home with me in! I guess that&apos;s
                        when!&quot;</p>
                    <p>An impulse in the direction of violence became visible upon the countenance
                        of Penrod.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I expect you need some wiping down,&quot; he began dangerously.
                        &quot;I&apos;ll give you sumpthing to remem&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, you will!&quot; Maurice cried with astonishing truculence,
                        contorting himself into what he may have considered a posture of defense.
                        &quot;Let&apos;s see you try it, youyou itcher!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-110" n="102"/>
                    <p>For the moment, defiance from such a source was dumfounding. Then, luckily,
                        Penrod recollected something and glanced at the automobile.</p>
                    <p>Perceiving therein not only the alert chauffeur but the magnificent outlines
                        of Mrs. Levy, his enemy&apos;s mother, he manuvred his lifted hand so
                        that it seemed he had but meant to scratch his ear.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I guess I better be goin&apos;,&quot; he said
                        casually. &quot;See you t&apos;-morrow!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Maurice mounted to the lap of luxury, and Penrod strolled away with an
                        assumption of careless ease which was put to a severe strain when, from the
                        rear window of the car, a sudden protuberance in the nature of a small,
                        dark, curly head shrieked scornfully: &quot;Go onyou big
                        stiff!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The cotillon loomed dismally before Penrod now; but it was his duty to secure
                        a partner and he set about it with a dreary heart. The delay occasioned by
                        his fruitless attempt on Marjorie and the altercation with his enemy at her
                        gate had allowed other ladies ample time to prepare for callersand to
                        receive them. Sadly he went from house to house, finding that he had been
                        preceded in one after the other. Altogether his hand for the cotillon was
                        declined eleven times that afternoon on the legitimate <pb id="VAA2383-111"
                            n="103"/> ground of previous engagement. This, with Marjorie, scored off
                        all except five of the seventeen possible partners; and four of the five
                        were also sealed away from him, as he learned in chance encounters with
                        other boys upon the street.</p>
                    <p>One lady alone remained; he bowed to the inevitable and entered this lorn
                        damsel&apos;s gate at twilight with an air of great discouragement. The
                        lorn damsel was Miss Rennsdale, aged eight.</p>
                    <p>We are apt to forget that there are actually times of life when too much
                        youth is a handicap. Miss Rennsdale was beautiful; she danced like a
                        premire; she had every charm but age. On that account alone had she been
                        allowed so much time to prepare to receive callers that it was only by the
                        most manful efforts she could keep her lip from trembling.</p>
                    <p>A decorous maid conducted the long-belated applicant to her where she sat
                        upon a sofa beside a nursery governess. The decorous maid announced him
                        composedly as he made his entrance.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mr. Penrod Schofield!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Miss Rennsdale suddenly burst into loud sobs.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh!&quot; she wailed. &quot;I just knew it would be
                        him!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The decorous maid&apos;s composure vanished at oncelikewise <pb
                            id="VAA2383-112" n="104"/> her decorum. She clapped her hand over her
                        mouth and fled, uttering sounds. The governess, however, set herself to
                        comfort her heartbroken charge, and presently succeeded in restoring Miss
                        Rennsdale to a semblance of that poise with which a lady receives callers
                        and accepts invitations to dance cotillons. But she continued to sob at
                        intervals.</p>
                    <p>Feeling himself at perhaps a disadvantage, Penrod made offer of his hand for
                        the morrow with a little embarrassment. Following the form prescribed by
                        Professor Bartet, he advanced several paces toward the stricken lady and
                        bowed formally.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I hope,&quot; he said by rote, &quot;you&apos;re well,
                        and your parents also in good health. May I have the pleasure of dancing the
                        cotillon as your partner t&apos;-morrow afternoon?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The wet eyes of Miss Rennsdale searched his countenance without pleasure, and
                        a shudder wrung her small shoulders; but the governess whispered to her
                        instructively, and she made a great effort.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thu-thank you fu-for your polite invu-invu-invutation; and I
                        ac&quot; Thus far she progressed when emotion overcame her again. She
                        beat frantically upon the sofa with fists and heels. &quot;Oh, I <hi
                            rend="i">did</hi> want it to be Georgie Bassett!&quot;</p>

                    <p>&quot;No, no, no!&quot; said the governess, and whispered urgently,
                        whereupon Miss Rennsdale was able to complete her acceptance.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And I ac-accept wu-with pu-pleasure!&quot; she moaned, and
                        immediately, uttering a loud yell, flung herself face downward upon the
                        sofa, clutching her governess convulsively.</p>
                    <p>Somewhat disconcerted, Penrod bowed again.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thank you for your polite acceptance,&quot; he murmured
                        hurriedly; &quot;and I trustI trustI forget. Oh, yesI trust we shall
                        have a most enjoyable occasion. Pray present my compliments to your parents;
                        and I must now wish you a very good afternoon.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Concluding these courtly demonstrations with another bow he withdrew in fair
                        order, though thrown into partial confusion in the hall by a final wail from
                        his crushed hostess: &quot;Oh! Why couldn&apos;t it be anybody but
                            <hi rend="i">him!&quot;</hi>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="b">N</hi>EXT morning Penrod woke in profound depression of spirit,
                        the cotillon ominous before him. He pictured Marjorie Jones and Maurice,
                        graceful and light-hearted, flitting by him fairylike, loosing silvery
                        laughter upon him as he engaged in the struggle to keep step with a partner
                        about four years and two feet his junior. It was hard enough for Penrod to
                        keep step with a girl of his size.</p>
                    <p>The foreboding vision remained with him, increasing in vividness, throughout
                        the forenoon. He found himself unable to fix his mind upon anything else,
                        and, having bent his gloomy footsteps toward the sawdust-box, after
                        breakfast, presently descended <pb id="VAA2383-116" n="108"/> therefrom,
                        abandoning Harold Ramorez where he had left him the preceding Saturday.
                        Then, as he sat communing silently with wistful Duke, in the storeroom,
                        coquettish fortune looked his way.</p>
                    <p>It was the habit of Penrod&apos;s mother not to throw away anything
                        whatsoever until years of storage conclusively proved there would never be a
                        use for it; but a recent house-cleaning had ejected upon the back porch a
                        great quantity of bottles and other paraphernalia of medicine, left over
                        from illnesses in the family during a period of several years. This dbris
                        Della, the cook, had collected in a large market basket, adding to it some
                        bottles of flavouring extracts that had proved unpopular in the household;
                        also, old catsup bottles; a jar or two of preserves gone bad; various
                        rejected dental liquidsand other things. And she carried the basket out to
                        the storeroom in the stable.</p>
                    <p>Penrod was at first unaware of what lay before him. Chin on palms, he sat
                        upon the iron rim of a former aquarium and stared morbidly through the open
                        door at the checkered departing back of Della. It was another who saw
                        treasure in the basket she had left.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-117" n="109"/>
                    <p>Mr. Samuel Williams, aged eleven, and congenial to Penrod in years, sex, and
                        disposition, appeared in the doorway, shaking into foam a black liquid
                        within a pint bottle, stoppered by a thumb.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yay, Penrod!&quot; the visitor gave greeting.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yay,&quot; said Penrod with slight enthusiasm. &quot;What
                        you got?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Lickrish water.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Drinkin&apos;s!&quot; demanded Penrod promptly. This is
                        equivalent to the cry of &quot;Biters&quot; when an apple is shown,
                        and establishes unquestionable title.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Down to there!&quot; stipulated Sam, removing his thumb to
                        affix it firmly as a mark upon the side of the bottlea check upon
                        gormandizing that remained carefully in place while Penrod drank. This rite
                        concluded, the visitor&apos;s eye fell upon the basket deposited by
                        Della. He emitted tokens of pleasure.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Looky! Looky! Looky there! That ain&apos;t any good pile
                        o&apos; stuffoh, no!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What for?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Drug store!&quot; shouted Sam. &quot;We&apos;ll be
                        partners&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Or else,&quot; Penrod suggested, &quot;I&apos;ll run
                        the drug store and you be a customer&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No! Partners!&quot; insisted Sam with such conviction <pb
                            id="VAA2383-118" n="110"/> that his host yielded; and within ten minutes
                        the drug store was doing a heavy business with imaginary patrons.
                        Improvising counters with boards and boxes, and setting forth a very
                        druggish-looking stock from the basket, each of the partners found
                        occupation to his tastePenrod as salesman and Sam as prescription clerk.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Here you are, madam!&quot; said Penrod briskly, offering a vial
                        of Sam&apos;s mixing to an invisible matron. &quot;This will cure
                        your husband in a few minutes. Here&apos;s the camphor, mister. Call
                        again! Fifty cents&apos; worth of pills? Yes, madam. There you are!
                        Hurry up with that dose for the nigger lady. Bill!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll &apos;tend to it soon&apos;s I get time,
                        Jim,&quot; replied the prescription clerk. &quot;I&apos;m busy

                    <p>Penrod stopped sales to watch this operation Sam had found an empty pint
                        bottle and, with the pursed lips and measuring eye of a great chemist, was
                        engaged in filling it from other bottles. First, he poured into it some of
                        the syrup from the condemned preserves; and a quantity of extinct hair oil;
                        next the remaining contents of a dozen small vials cryptically labelled with

                    <p>Sam examined the combination with concern, appearing unsatisfied.
                        &quot;We got to make that smallpox medicine good and strong!&quot;
                        he remarked; and, his artistic sense growing more powerful than his
                        appetite, he poured about a quarter of the licorice water into the smallpox
                        medicine.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What you doin&apos;?&quot; protested Penrod. &quot;What
                        you want to waste that lickrish water for? We ought to keep it to drink when
                        we&apos;re tired.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I guess I got a right to use my own lickrish water any way I want
                        to,&quot; replied the prescription clerk. &quot;I tell you, you
                        can&apos;t get smallpox medicine too strong. Look at her now!&quot;
                        He held the bottle up admiringly. &quot;She&apos;s as black as
                        lickrish. I bet you she&apos;s strong all right!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wonder how she tastes?&quot; said Penrod thoughtfully.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t smell so awful much,&quot; observed Sam,
                        sniffing the bottle&quot;a good deal, though!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-121" n="113"/>
                    <p>&quot;I wonder if it&apos;d make us sick to drink it?&quot; said
                        Penrod.</p>
                    <p>Sam looked at the bottle thoughtfully; then his eye, wandering, fell upon
                        Duke, placidly curled up near the door, and lighted with the advent of an
                        idea new to him, but old, old in the worldolder than Egypt!</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let&apos;s give Duke some!&quot; he cried.</p>
                    <p>That was the spark. They acted immediately; and a minute late Duke, released
                        from custody with a competent potion of the smallpox medicine inside him,
                        settled conclusively their doubts concerning its effect. The patient animal,
                        accustomed to expect the worst at all times, walked out of the door, shaking
                        his head with an air of considerable annoyance, opening and closing his
                        mouth with singular energyand so repeatedly that they began to count the
                        number of times he did it. Sam thought it was thirty-nine times, but Penrod
                        had counted forty-one before other and more striking symptoms appeared.</p>
                    <p>All things come from Mother Earth and must returnDuke restored much at this
                        time. Afterward, he ate heartily of grass; and then, over his shoulder, he
                        bent upon his master one inscrutable look and departed feebly to the front
                        yard.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-122" n="114"/>
                    <p>The two boys had watched the process with warm interest. &quot;I told you
                        she was strong!&quot; said Mr. Williams proudly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, sirshe is!&quot; Penrod was generous enough to admit.
                        &quot;I expect she&apos;s strong enough&quot; He paused in
                        thought, and added: &quot;We haven&apos;t got a horse any
                        more.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I bet you she&apos;d fix him if you had!&quot; said Sam.
                        And it may be that this was no idle boast.</p>
                    <p>The pharmaceutical game was not resumed; the experiment upon Duke had made
                        the drug store commonplace and stimulated the appetite for stronger meat.
                        Lounging in the doorway, the near-vivisectionists sipped licorice water
                        alternately and conversed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I bet some of our smallpox medicine would fix ole P&apos;fessor
                        Bartet all right!&quot; quoth Penrod. &quot;I wish he&apos;d
                        come along and ask us for some.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We could tell him it was lickrish water,&quot; added Sam,
                        liking the idea. &quot;The two bottles look almost the same.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then we wouldn&apos;t have to go to his ole cotillon this
                        afternoon,&quot; Penrod sighed. &quot;There wouldn&apos;t be
                        any!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who&apos;s your partner, Pen?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-123" n="115"/>
                    <p>&quot;Who&apos;s yours?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who&apos;s yours? I just ast you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, she&apos;s all right!&quot; And Penrod smiled
                        boast-fully.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I bet you wanted to dance with Marjorie!&quot; said his friend.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Me? I wouldn&apos;t dance with that girl if she begged me to! I
                        wouldn&apos;t dance with her to save her from drowning! I
                        wouldn&apos;t da&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, noyou wouldn&apos;t!&quot; interrupted Mr. Williams
                        skeptically.</p>
                    <p>Penrod changed his tone and became persuasive.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Looky here, Sam,&quot; he said confidentially.
                        &quot;I&apos;ve got a mighty nice partner, but my mother
                        don&apos;t like her mother; and so I&apos;ve been thinking I better
                        not dance with her. I&apos;ll tell you what I&apos;ll do;
                        I&apos;ve got a mighty good sling in the house, and I&apos;ll give
                        it to you if you&apos;ll change partners.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You want to change and you don&apos;t even know who mine
                        is!&quot; said Sam, and he made the simple though precocious deduction:
                        &quot;Yours must be a lala! Well, I invited Mabel Rorebeck, and she
                        wouldn&apos;t let me change if I wanted to. Mabel Rorebeck&apos;d
                        rather dance with me,&quot; he continued serenely, &quot;than
                        anybody; and she said she was awful <pb id="VAA2383-124" n="116"/> afraid
                        you&apos;d ast her. But I ain&apos;t goin&apos; to dance with
                        Mabel after all, because this morning she sent me a note about her uncle
                        died last nightand P&apos;fessor Bartet&apos;ll have to find me a
                        partner after I get there. Anyway I bet you haven&apos;t got any
                        slingand I bet your partner&apos;s Baby Rennsdale!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What if she is?&quot; said Penrod. &quot;She&apos;s
                        good enough for <hi rend="i">me!&quot;</hi> This speech held not so much
                        modesty in solution as intended praise of the lady. Taken literally,
                        however, it was an understatement of the facts and wholly insincere.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yay!&quot; jeered Mr. Williams, upon whom his friend&apos;s
                        hypocrisy was quite wasted. &quot;How can your mother not like her
                        mother? Baby Rennsdale hasn&apos;t got any mother! You and
                        her&apos;ll be a sight!&quot;</p>
                    <p>That was Penrod&apos;s own conviction; and with this corroboration of it
                        he grew so spiritless that he could offer no retort. He slid to a despondent
                        sitting posture upon the doorsill and gazed wretchedly upon the ground,
                        while his companion went to replenish the licorice water at the
                        hydrantenfeebling the potency of the liquor no doubt, but making up for that
                        in quantity.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Your mother goin&apos; with you to the cotillon?&quot;
                        asked Sam when he returned.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-125" n="117"/>
                    <p>&quot;No. She&apos;s goin&apos; to meet me there. She&apos;s
                        goin&apos; somewhere first.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So&apos;s mine,&quot; said Sam. &quot;I&apos;ll
                        come by for you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I better go before long. Noon whistles been
                        blowin&apos;.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right,&quot; Penrod repeated dully.</p>
                    <p>Sam turned to go, but paused. A new straw hat was peregrinating along the
                        fence near the two boys. This hat belonged to someone passing upon the
                        sidewalk of the cross-street; and the someone was Maurice Levy. Even as they
                        stared, he halted and regarded them over the fence with two small, dark
                        eyes.</p>
                    <p>Fate had brought about this moment and this confrontation.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="b">L</hi>O, SAM!&quot; said Maurice cautiously. &quot;What
                        you doin&apos;?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Penrod at that instant had a singular experiencean intellectual shock like a
                        flash of fire in the brain. Sitting in darkness, a great light flooded him
                        with wild brilliance. He gasped!</p>
                    <p>&quot;What you doin&apos;?&quot; repeated Mr. Levy.</p>
                    <p>Penrod sprang to his feet, seized the licorice bottle, shook it with
                        stoppering thumb, and took a long drink with histrionic unction.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What you doin&apos;?&quot; asked Maurice for the third
                        time, Sam Williams not having decided upon a reply.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-127" n="119"/>
                    <p>It was Penrod who answered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Drinkin&apos; lickrish water,&quot; he said simply, and
                        wiped his mouth with such delicious enjoyment that Sam&apos;s jaded
                        thirst was instantly stimulated. He took the bottle eagerly from Penrod.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A-a-h!&quot; exclaimed Penrod, smacking his lips.
                        &quot;That was a good un!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The eyes above the fence glistened.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ask him if he don&apos;t want some,&quot; Penrod whispered
                        urgently. &quot;Quit drinkin&apos; it! It&apos;s no good any
                        more. Ask him!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What for?&quot; demanded the practical Sam.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Go on and ask him!&quot; whispered Penrod fiercely.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Say, M&apos;rice!&quot; Sam called, waving the bottle.
                        &quot;Want some?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Bring it here!&quot; Mr. Levy requested.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come on over and get some,&quot; returned Sam, being prompted.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t. Penrod Schofield&apos;s after me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, I&apos;m not,&quot; said Penrod reassuringly.
                        &quot;I won&apos;t touch you, M&apos;rice. I made up with you
                        yesterday afternoondon&apos;t you remember? You&apos;re all right
                        with me, M&apos;rice.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Maurice looked undecided. But Penrod had the delectable bottle again, and
                        tilting it above his lips, <pb id="VAA2383-128" n="120"/> affected to let
                        the cool liquid purl enrichingly into him, while with his right hand he
                        stroked his middle faade ineffably. Maurice&apos;s mouth watered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Here!&quot; cried Sam, stirred again by the superb
                        manifestations of his friend. &quot;Gimme that!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Penrod brought the bottle down, surprisingly full after so much gusto, but
                        withheld it from Sam; and the two scuffled for its possession. Nothing in
                        the world could have so worked upon the desire of the yearning observer
                        beyond the fence.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Honest, Penrodyou ain&apos;t goin&apos; to touch me if I
                        come in your yard?&quot; he called. &quot;Honest?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Cross my heart!&quot; answered Penrod, holding the bottle away
                        from Sam. &quot;And we&apos;ll let you drink all you want.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Maurice hastily climbed the fence, and while he was thus occupied Mr. Samuel
                        Williams received a great enlightenment. With startling rapidity Penrod,
                        standing just outside the storeroom door, extended his arm within the room,
                        deposited the licorice water upon the counter of the drug store, seized in
                        its stead the bottle of smallpox medicine, and extended it cordially toward
                        the advancing Maurice.</p>
                    <p>Genius is like thatgreat, simple, broad strokes!</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-129" n="121"/>
                    <p>Dazzled, Mr. Samuel Williams leaned against the wall. He had the sensations
                        of one who comes suddenly into the presence of a chef-d&apos;uvre.
                        Perhaps his first coherent thought was that almost universal one on such
                        huge occasions: &quot;Why couldn&apos;t <hi rend="i">I</hi> have
                        done that!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Sam might have been even more dazzled had he guessed that he figured not
                        altogether as a spectator in the sweeping and magnificent conception of the
                        new Talleyrand. Sam had no partner for the cotillon. If Maurice was to be
                        absent from that festivityas it began to seem he might bePenrod needed a
                        male friend to take care of Miss Rennsdale; and he believed he saw his way
                        to compel Mr. Williams to be that male friend. For this he relied largely
                        upon the prospective conduct of Miss Rennsdale when he should get the matter
                        before herhe was inclined to believe she would favour the exchange. As for
                        Talleyrand Penrod himself, he was going to dance that cotillon with Marjorie
                        Jones!</p>
                    <p>&quot;You can have all you can drink at one pull,
                        M&apos;rice,&quot; said Penrod kindly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You said I could have all I want!&quot; protested Maurice,
                        reaching for the bottle.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-130" n="122"/>
                    <p>&quot;No, I didn&apos;t,&quot; returned Penrod quickly, holding
                        it away from the eager hand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He did, too! Didn&apos;t he, Sam?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Sam could not reply; his eyes, fixed upon the bottle, protruded strangely.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You heard himdidn&apos;t you, Sam?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, if I did say it I didn&apos;t mean it!&quot; said
                        Penrod hastily, quoting from one of the authorities. &quot;Looky here,
                        M&apos;rice,&quot; he continued, assuming a more placative and
                        reasoning tone, &quot;that wouldn&apos;t be fair to us. I guess we
                        want some of our own lickrish water, don&apos;t we? The bottle
                        ain&apos;t much over two-thirds full anyway. What I meant was, you can
                        have all you can drink at one pull.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How do you mean?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, this way: you can gulp all you want, so long as you keep
                        swallering; but you can&apos;t take the bottle out of your mouth and
                        commence again. Soon&apos;s you quit swallering it&apos;s
                        Sam&apos;s turn.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No; you can have next, Penrod,&quot; said Sam.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, anyway, I mean M&apos;rice has to give the bottle up the
                        minute he stops swallering.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Craft appeared upon the face of Maurice, like a poster pasted on a wall.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can drink so long I don&apos;t stop swallering?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-131" n="123"/>
                    <p>&quot;Yes; that&apos;s it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right!&quot; he cried. &quot;Gimme the
                        bottle!&quot;</p>
                    <p>And Penrod placed it in his hand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You promise to let me drink until I quit swallering?&quot;
                        Maurice insisted.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes!&quot; said both boys together.</p>
                    <p>With that, Maurice placed the bottle to his lips and began to drink. Penrod
                        and Sam leaned forward in breathless excitement. They had feared Maurice
                        might smell the contents of the bottle; but that danger was pastthis was the
                        crucial moment. Their fondest hope was that he would make his first swallow
                        a voracious oneit was impossible to imagine a second. They expected one big,
                        gulping swallow and then an explosion, with fountain effects.</p>
                    <p>Little they knew the mettle of their man! Maurice swallowed once; he
                        swallowed twiceand thriceand he continued to swallow! No Adam&apos;s
                        apple was sculptured on that juvenile throat, but the internal progress of
                        the liquid was not a whit the less visible. His eyes gleamed with cunning
                        and malicious triumph, sidewise, at the stunned conspirators; he was
                        fulfilling the conditions of the draught, not once breaking the thread of
                        that marvellous swallering.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-132" n="124"/>
                    <p>His audience stood petrified. Already Maurice had swallowed more than they
                        had given Dukeand still the liquor receded in the uplifted bottle! And now
                        the clear glass gleamed above the dark contents full half the
                        vessel&apos;s lengthand Maurice went on drinking! Slowly the clear glass
                        increased in its dimensionsslowly the dark diminished.</p>
                    <p>Sam Williams made a horrified movement to check himbut Maurice protested
                        passionately with his disengaged arm, and made vehement vocal noises
                        remindful of the contract; whereupon Sam desisted and watched the continuing
                        performance in a state of grisly fascination.</p>
                    <p>Maurice drank it all! He drained the last drop and threw the bottle in the
                        air, uttering loud ejaculations of triumph and satisfaction.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hah!&quot; he cried, blowing out his cheeks, inflating his
                        chest, squaring his shoulders, patting his stomach, and wiping his mouth
                        contentedly. &quot;Hah! Aha! Waha! Wafwah! But that was good!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The two boys stood looking at him in stupor.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I gotta say this,&quot; said Maurice graciously:
                        &quot;You stuck to your bargain all right and treated me fair.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Stricken with a sudden horrible suspicion, Penrod <pb id="VAA2383-133"
                            n="125"/> entered the storeroom in one stride and lifted the bottle of
                        licorice water to his nosethen to his lips. It was weak, but good; he had
                        made no mistake. And Maurice had really drainedto the dregsthe bottle of old
                        hair tonics, dead catsups, syrups of undesirable preserves, condemned
                        extracts of vanilla and lemon, decayed chocolate, exessence of beef, mixed
                        dental preparations, aromatic spirits of ammonia, spirits of nitre, alcohol,
                        arnica, quinine, ipecac, sal volatile, nux vomica and licorice waterwith
                        traces of arsenic, belladonna and strychnine.</p>
                    <p>Penrod put the licorice water out of sight and turned to face the others.
                        Maurice was seating himself on a box just outside the door and had taken a
                        package of cigarettes from his pocket.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nobody can see me from here, can they?&quot; he said, striking
                        a match. &quot;You fellers smoke?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said Sam, staring at him haggardly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said Penrod in a whisper.</p>
                    <p>Maurice lit his cigarette and puffed showily.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, sir,&quot; he remarked, &quot;you fellers are
                        certainly squareI gotta say that much. Honest, Penrod, I thought you was
                        after me! I did think so,&quot; he added sunnily; &quot;but now I
                        guess you like <pb id="VAA2383-134" n="126"/> me, or else you
                        wouldn&apos;t of stuck to it about lettin&apos; me drink it all if I
                        kept on swallering.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He chatted on with complete geniality, smoking his cigarette in content. And
                        as he ran from one topic to another his hearers stared at him in a kind of
                        torpor. Never once did they exchange a glance with each other; their eyes
                        were frozen to Maurice. The cheerful conversationalist made it evident that
                        he was not without gratitude.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; he said as he finished his cigarette and rose to
                        go, &quot;you fellers have treated me niceand some day you come over to
                        my yard; I&apos;d like to run with you fellers. You&apos;re the kind
                        of fellers I like.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Penrod&apos;s jaw fell; Sam&apos;s mouth had been open all the time.
                        Neither spoke.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I gotta go,&quot; observed Maurice, consulting a handsome
                        watch. &quot;Gotta get dressed for the cotillon right after lunch. Come
                        on, Sam. Don&apos;t you have to go, too?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Sam nodded dazedly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, good-bye, Penrod,&quot; said Maurice cordially.
                        &quot;I&apos;m glad you like me all right. Come on, Sam.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Penrod leaned against the doorpost and with fixed <pb id="VAA2383-135"
                            n="127"/> and glazing eyes watched the departure of his two visitors.
                        Maurice was talking volubly, with much gesticulation, as they went; but Sam
                        walked mechanically and in silence, staring at his brisk companion and
                        keeping at a little distance from him.</p>
                    <p>They passed from sight, Maurice still conversing gaylyand Penrod slowly
                        betook himself into the house, his head bowed upon his chest.</p>
                    <p>Some three hours later, Mr. Samuel Williams, waxen clean and in sweet
                        raiment, made his reappearance in Penrod&apos;s yard, yodelling a
                        code-signal to summon forth his friend. He yodelled loud, long, and
                        frequently, finally securing a faint response from the upper air.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where are you?&quot; shouted Mr. Williams, his
                        <unclear>-oving</unclear> glance searching ambient heights. Another
                        low-spirited yodel reaching his ear, he perceived the head and shoulders of
                        his friend projecting above the roofridge of the stable. The rest of
                        Penrod&apos;s body was concealed from view, reposing upon the opposite
                        slant of the gable and precariously secured by the crooking of his elbows
                        over the ridge.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yay! What you doin&apos; up there?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nothin&apos;&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-136" n="128"/>
                    <p>&quot;You better be careful!&quot; Sam called.
                        &quot;You&apos;ll slide off and fall down in the alley if you
                        don&apos;t look out. I come pert&apos; near it last time we was up
                        there. Come on down! Ain&apos;t you goin&apos; to the
                        cotillon?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Penrod made no reply. Sam came nearer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Say,&quot; he called up in a guarded voice, &quot;I went to
                        our telephone a while ago and ast him how he was feelin&apos;, and he
                        said he felt fine!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So did I,&quot; said Penrod. &quot;He told me he felt
                        bully!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Sam thrust his hands in his pockets and brooded. The opening of the kitchen
                        door caused a diversion. It was Della.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mister Penrod,&quot; she bellowed forthwith, &quot;come ahn
                        down fr&apos;m up there! Y&apos;r mamma&apos;s at the
                        dancin&apos; class waitin&apos; fer ye, an&apos; she&apos;s
                        telephoned me they&apos;re goin&apos; to beginan&apos;
                        what&apos;s the matter with ye? Come ahn down fr&apos;m up
                        there!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come on!&quot; urged Sam. &quot;We&apos;ll be late.
                        There go Maurice and Marjorie now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>A glittering car spun by, disclosing briefly a genre picture of Marjorie
                        Jones in pink, supporting a monstrous sheaf of American Beauty roses.
                        Maurice, sitting shining and joyous beside her, saw both boys <pb
                            id="VAA2383-137" n="129"/> and waved them a hearty greeting as the car
                        turned the corner.</p>
                    <p>Penrod uttered some muffled words and then waved both armseither in response
                        or as an expression of his condition of mind; it may have been a gesture of
                        despair. How much intention there was in this actobviously so rash,
                        considering the position he occupiedit is impossible to say. Undeniably
                        there must remain a suspicion of deliberate purpose.</p>
                    <p>Della screamed and Sam shouted. Penrod had disappeared from view.</p>
                    <p>The delayed dance was about to begin a most uneven cotillon under the
                        direction of its slightly frenzied instructor, when Samuel Williams arrived.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Schofield hurriedly left the ballroom; while Miss Rennsdale, flushing
                        with sudden happiness, curtsied profoundly to Professor Bartet and obtained
                        his attention.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have telled you fifty times,&quot; he informed her
                        passionately ere she spoke, &quot;I cannot make no such changes. If your
                        partner comes you have to dance with him. You are going to drive me crazy,
                        sure! What is it? What now? What you want?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-138" n="130"/>
                    <p>The damsel curtsied again and handed him the following communication,

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="b">P</hi>ENROD entered the schoolroom, Monday morning,
                        picturesquely leaning upon a man&apos;s cane shortened to support a
                        cripple approaching the age of twelve. He arrived about twenty minutes late,
                        limping deeply, his brave young mouth drawn with pain, and the sensation he
                        created must have been a solace to him; the only possible criticism of this
                        entrance being that it was just a shade too heroic. Perhaps for that reason
                        it failed to stagger Miss Spence, a woman so saturated with suspicion that
                        she penalized Penrod for tardiness as <pb id="VAA2383-140" n="132"/>
                        promptly and as coldly as if he had been a mere, ordinary, unmutilated boy.
                        Nor would she entertain any discussion of the justice of her ruling. It
                        seemed, almost, that she feared to argue with him.</p>
                    <p>However, the distinction of cane and limp remained to him, consolations which
                        he protracted far into the weekuntil Thursday evening, in fact, when Mr.
                        Schofield, observing from a window his son&apos;s pursuit of Duke round
                        and round the back-yard, confiscated the cane, with the promise that it
                        should not remain idle if he saw Penrod limping again. Thus, succeeding a
                        depressing Friday, another Saturday brought the necessity for new
                        inventions.</p>
                    <p>It was a scented morning in apple-blossom time. At about ten of the clock
                        Penrod emerged hastily from the kitchen door. His pockets bulged abnormally;
                        so did his cheeks, and he swallowed with difficulty. A threatening mop,
                        wielded by a cooklike arm in a checkered sleeve, followed him through the
                        doorway, and he was preceded by a small, hurried, wistful dog with a warm
                        doughnut in his mouth. The kitchen door slammed petulantly, enclosing the
                        sore voice of Della, whereupon Penrod and Duke seated themselves upon the
                        pleasant sward and immediately consumed the spoils of their raid.</p>

                    <p>From the cross-street which formed the side boundary of the
                        Schofields&apos; ample yard came a jingle of harness and the cadenced
                        clatter of a pair of trotting horses, and Penrod, looking up, beheld the
                        passing of a fat acquaintance, torpid amid the conservative splendours of a
                        rather old-fashioned victoria. This was Roderick Magsworth Bitts, Junior, a
                        fellow sufferer at the Friday Afternoon Dancing Class, but otherwise not
                        often a companion; a home-sheltered lad, tutored privately and preserved
                        against the coarsening influences of rude comradeship and miscellaneous
                        information. Heavily overgrown in all physical dimensions, virtuous, and
                        placid, this cloistered mutton was wholly uninteresting to Penrod Schofield.
                        Nevertheless, Roderick Magsworth Bitts, Junior, was a personage on account
                        of the importance of the Magsworth Bitts family; and it was
                        Penrod&apos;s destiny to increase Roderick&apos;s celebrity far, far
                        beyond its present aristocratic limitations.</p>
                    <p>The Magsworth Bittses were important because they were impressive; there was
                        no other reason. And they were impressive because they believed themselves
                        important. The adults of the family were impregnably formal; they dressed
                        with reticent <pb id="VAA2383-143" n="135"/> elegance, and wore the same
                        nose and the same expressionan expression which indicated that they knew
                        something exquisite and sacred which other people could never know. Other
                        people, in their presence, were apt to feel mysteriously ignoble and to
                        become secretly uneasy about ancestors, gloves, and pronunciation. The
                        Magsworth Bitts manner was withholding and reserved, though sometimes
                        gracious, granting small smiles as great favours and giving off a chilling
                        kind of preciousness. Naturally when any citizen of the community did
                        anything unconventional or improper, or made a mistake, or had a relative
                        who went wrong, that citizen&apos;s first and worst fear was that the
                        Magsworth Bittses would hear of it. In fact, this painful family had for
                        years terrorized the community, though the community had never realized that
                        it was terrorized, and invariably spoke of the family as the &quot;most
                        charming circle in town.&quot; By common consent, Mrs. Roderick
                        Magsworth Bitts officiated as the supreme model as well as critic-in-chief
                        of morals and deportment for all the unlucky people prosperous enough to be
                        elevated to her acquaintance.</p>
                    <p>Magsworth was the important part of the name. Mrs. Roderick Magsworth Bitts
                        was a Magsworth <pb id="VAA2383-144" n="136"/> born, herself, and the
                        Magsworth crest decorated not only Mrs. Magsworth Bitts&apos; note-paper
                        but was on the china, on the table linen, on the chimney-pieces, on the
                        opaque glass of the front door, on the victoria, and on the harness, though
                        omitted from the garden-hose and the lawn-mower.</p>
                    <p>Naturally, no sensible person dreamed of connecting that illustrious crest
                        with the unfortunate and notorious Rena Magsworth whose name had grown week
                        by week into larger and larger type upon the front pages of newspapers,
                        owing to the gradually increasing public and official belief that she had
                        poisoned a family of eight. However, the statement that no sensible person
                        could have connected the Magsworth Bitts family with the arsenical Rena
                        takes no account of Penrod Schofield.</p>
                    <p>Penrod never missed a murder, a hanging or an electrocution in the
                        newspapers; he knew almost as much about Rena Magsworth as her jurymen did,
                        though they sat in a court-room two hundred miles away, and he had it in
                        mindso frank he wasto ask Roderick Magsworth Bitts, Junior, if the murderess
                        happened to be a relative.</p>
                    <p>The present encounter, being merely one of apathetic greeting, did not afford
                        the opportunity. Penrod <pb id="VAA2383-145" n="137"/> took off his cap, and
                        Roderick, seated between his mother and one of his grown-up sisters, nodded
                        sluggishly, but neither Mrs. Magsworth Bitts nor her daughter acknowledged
                        the salutation of the boy in the yard. They disapproved of him as a person
                        of little consequence, and that little, bad. Snubbed, Penrod thoughtfully
                        restored his cap to his head. A boy can be cut as effectually as a man, and
                        this one was chilled to a low temperature. He wondered if they despised him
                        because they had seen a last fragment of doughnut in his hand; then he
                        thought that perhaps it was Duke who had disgraced him. Duke was certainly
                        no fashionable looking dog.</p>
                    <p>The resilient spirits of youth, however, presently revived, and discovering a
                        spider upon one knee and a beetle simultaneously upon the other, Penrod
                        forgot Mrs. Roderick Magsworth Bitts in the course of some experiments
                        infringing upon the domain of Doctor Carrel. Penrod&apos;s effortswith
                        the aid of a pinto effect a transference of living organism were
                        unsuccessful; but he convinced himself forever that a spider cannot walk
                        with a beetle&apos;s legs. Della then enhanced zological interest by
                        depositing upon the back porch a large rat-trap from the cellar, the prison
                        of four live rats awaiting execution.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-146" n="138"/>
                    <p>Penrod at once took possession, retiring to the empty stable, where he
                        installed the rats in a small wooden box with a sheet of broken
                        window-glassheld down by a brickbatover the top. Thus the symptoms of their
                        agitation, when the box was shaken or hammered upon, could be studied at
                        leisure. Altogether this Saturday was starting splendidly.</p>
                    <p>After a time, the student&apos;s attention was withdrawn from his
                        specimens by a peculiar smell, which, being followed up by a system of
                        selective sniffing, proved to be an emanation leaking into the stable from
                        the alley. He opened the back door.</p>
                    <p>Across the alley was a cottage which a thrifty neighbour had built on the
                        rear line of his lot and rented to negroes; and the fact that a negro family
                        was now in process of &quot;moving in&quot; was manifested by the
                        presence of a thin mule and a ramshackle wagon, the latter laden with the
                        semblance of a stove and a few other unpretentious household articles.</p>
                    <p>A very small darky boy stood near the mule. In his hand was a rusty chain,
                        and at the end of the chain the delighted Penrod perceived the source of the
                        special smell he was tracinga large raccoon. <pb id="VAA2383-147" n="139"/>
                        Duke, who had shown not the slightest interest in the rats, set up a frantic
                        barking and simulated a ravening assault upon the strange animal. It was
                        only a bit of acting, however, for Duke was an old dog, had suffered much,
                        and desired no unnecessary sorrow, wherefore he confined his demonstrations
                        to alarums and excursions, and presently sat down at a distance and
                        expressed himself by intermittent threatenings in a quavering falsetto.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s that &apos;coon&apos;s name?&quot;
                        asked Penrod, intending no discourtesy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aim gommo mame,&quot; said the small darky.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aim gommo mame.&quot;</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">&quot;What?&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The small darky looked annoyed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aim <hi rend="i">gommo</hi> mame, I hell you,&quot; he said
                        impatiently.</p>
                    <p>Penrod conceived that insult was intended.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s the matter of you?&quot; he demanded advancing.
                        &quot;You get fresh with <hi rend="i">me,</hi> and
                        I&apos;ll&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hyuh, white boy!&quot; A coloured youth of Penrod&apos;s
                        own age appeared in the doorway of the cottage. &quot;You let
                        &apos;at brothuh mine alone. He ain&apos; do nothin&apos; to
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-148" n="140"/>
                    <p>&quot;Well, why can&apos;t he answer?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He can&apos;t. He can&apos;t talk no better&apos;n what
                        he <hi rend="i">was</hi> talkin&apos;. He
                        tongue-tie&apos;.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; said Penrod, mollified. Then, obeying an impulse so
                        universally aroused in the human breast under like circumstances that it has
                        become a quip, he turned to the afflicted one.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Talk some more,&quot; he begged eagerly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I hoe you ackoom aim gommo mame,&quot; was the prompt response,
                        in which a slight ostentation was manifest. Unmistakable tokens of vanity
                        had appeared upon the small, swart countenance.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s he mean?&quot; asked Penrod, enchanted.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He say he tole you &apos;at &apos;coon ain&apos; got no
                        name.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s <hi rend="i">your</hi> name?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m name Herman.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s his name?&quot; Penrod pointed to the
                        tongue-tied boy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Verman.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Verman. Was three us boys in ow fam&apos;ly. Ol&apos;est
                        one name Sherman. &apos;N&apos;en come me; I&apos;m Herman.

                    <p>&quot;You goin&apos; to live here?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-149" n="141"/>
                    <p>&quot;Umhuh. Done move in f&apos;m way outen on a fahm.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He pointed to the north with his right hand, and Penrod&apos;s eyes
                        opened wide as they followed the gesture. Herman had no forefinger on that
                        hand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Look there!&quot; exclaimed Penrod. &quot;You
                        haven&apos;t got any finger!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">I</hi> mum map,&quot; said Verman, with egregious
                        pride.</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">He</hi> done &apos;at,&quot; interpreted

                    <p>&quot;Yessuh, I tole him to,&quot; said Herman,

                    <p>&quot;But what&apos;d you tell him to do it for?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nothin&apos;. I jes&apos; said it &apos;at

                    <p>Both brothers looked pleased and proud. Penrod&apos;s profound interest
                        was flatteringly visible, a tribute to their unusualness.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-150" n="142"/>
                    <p>&quot;Hem bow goy,&quot; suggested Herman eagerly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aw ri&apos;,&quot; said Herman. &quot;Ow sistuh

                    <p>Penrod looked in the window and was rewarded by a fine view of
                        Queenie&apos;s goitre. He had never before seen one, and only the lure
                        of further conversation on the part of Verman brought him from the window.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Verman say tell you &apos;bout pappy,&quot; explained
                        Herman. &quot;Mammy an&apos; Queenie move in town an&apos; go

                    <p>&quot;Wif a pitchfawk.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Penrod began to feel that a lifetime spent with this fascinating family were
                        all too short. The brothers, glowing with amiability, were as enraptured <pb
                            id="VAA2383-151" n="143"/> as he. For the first time in their lives they
                        moved in the rich glamour of sensationalism. Herman was prodigal of gesture
                        with his right hand; and Verman, chuckling with delight, talked fluently,
                        though somewhat consciously. They cheerfully agreed to keep the
                        raccoonalready beginning to be mentioned as &quot;our
                        &apos;coon&quot; by Penrodin Mr. Schofield&apos;s empty stable,
                        and, when the animal had been chained to the wall near the box of rats and
                        supplied with a pan of fair water, they assented to their new
                        friend&apos;s suggestion (inspired by a fine sense of the artistic
                        harmonies) that the heretofore nameless pet be christened Sherman, in honour
                        of their deceased relative.</p>
                    <p>At this juncture was heard from the front yard the sound of that yodelling
                        which is the peculiar accomplishment of those whose voices have not
                        &quot;changed.&quot; Penrod yodelled a response; and Mr. Samuel
                        Williams appeared, a large bundle under his arm.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yay, Penrod!&quot; was his greeting, casual enough from
                        without; but, having entered, he stopped short and emitted a prodigious
                        whistle. &quot;<hi rend="i">Ya-a-ay!</hi>&quot; he then shouted.
                        &quot;Look at the &apos;coon!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I guess you better say, &apos;Look at the
                        &apos;coon!&apos;&quot; Penrod returned proudly.
                        &quot;They&apos;s a good deal <pb id="VAA2383-152" n="144"/>
                        more&apos;n him to look at, too. Talk some, Verman.&quot; Verman
                        complied.</p>
                    <p>Sam was warmly interested. &quot;What&apos;d you say his name
                        was?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Verman.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How d&apos;you spell it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;V-e-r-m-a-n,&quot; replied Penrod, having previously received
                        this information from Herman.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh!&quot; said Sam.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Point to sumpthing, Herman,&quot; Penrod commanded, and
                        Sam&apos;s excitement, when Herman pointed was sufficient to the
                        occasion.</p>
                    <p>Penrod, the discoverer, continued his exploitation of the manifold wonders of
                        the Sherman, Herman, and Verman collection. With the air of a proprietor he
                        escorted Sam into the alley for a good look at Queenie (who seemed not to
                        care for her increasing celebrity) and proceeded to a dramatic climaxthe
                        recital of the episode of the pitchfork and its consequences.</p>
                    <p>The cumulative effect was enormous, and could have but one possible result.
                        The normal boy is always at least one half Barnum.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let&apos;s get up a SHOW!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Penrod and Sam both claimed to have said it <pb id="VAA2383-153" n="145"/>
                        first, a question left unsettled in the ecstasies of hurried preparation.
                        The bundle under Sam&apos;s arm, brought with no definite purpose,
                        proved to have been an inspiration. It consisted of broad sheets of light
                        yellow wrapping-paper, discarded by Sam&apos;s mother in her spring
                        house-cleaning. There were half-filled cans and buckets of paint in the
                        storeroom adjoining the carriage-house, and presently the side wall of the
                        stable flamed information upon the passer-by from a great and spreading
                        poster.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Publicity,&quot; primal requisite of all theatrical and
                        amphitheatrical enterprise thus provided, subsequent arrangements proceeded
                        with a fury of energy which transformed the empty hay-loft. True, it is
                        impossible to say just what the hay-loft was transformed into, but history
                        warrantably clings to the statement that it was transformed. Duke and
                        Sherman were secured to the rear wall at a considerable distance from each
                        other, after an exhibition of reluctance on the part of Duke, during which
                        he displayed a nervous energy and agility almost miraculous in so small and
                        middle-aged a dog. Benches were improvised for spectators; the rats were
                        brought up; finally the rafters, corn-crib, and hay-chute were ornamented
                        with flags and strips of bunting from <pb id="VAA2383-154" n="146"/> Sam
                        Williams&apos; attic, Sam returning from the excursion wearing an old
                        silk hat, and accompanied (on account of a rope) by a fine dachshund
                        encountered on the highway. In the matter of personal decoration paint was
                        generously used: an interpretation of the spiral, inclining to whites and
                        greens, becoming brilliantly effective upon the dark facial backgrounds of
                        Herman and Verman; while the countenances of Sam and Penrod were each
                        supplied with the black moustache and imperial, lacking which, no
                        professional showman can be esteemed conscientious.</p>
                    <p>It was regretfully decided, in council, that no attempt be made to add
                        Queenie to the list of exhibits, her brothers warmly declining to act as
                        ambassadors in that cause. They were certain Queenie would not like the
                        idea, they said, and Herman picturesquely described her activity on
                        occasions when she had been annoyed by too much attention to her appearance.
                        However, Penrod&apos;s disappointment was alleviated by an inspiration
                        which came to him in a moment of pondering upon the dachshund, and the
                        entire party went forth to add an enriching line to the poster.</p>
                    <p>They found a group of seven, including two adults, <pb id="VAA2383-155"
                            n="147"/> already gathered in the street to read and admire this work.</p>

                        <hi rend="b">S</hi>AM, Penrod, Herman, and Verman withdrew in considerable
                        state from non-paying view, and, repairing to the hay-loft, declared the
                        exhibition open to the public. Oral proclamation was made by Sam, and then
                        the loitering multitude was enticed by the seductive strains of a band; the
                        two partners performing upon combs and paper, Herman and Verman upon tin
                        pans with sticks.</p>
                    <p>The effect was immediate. Visitors appeared upon the stairway and sought
                        admission. Herman and Verman took position among the exhibits, near <pb
                            id="VAA2383-158" n="150"/> the wall; Sam stood at the entrance,
                        officiating as barker and ticket-seller; while Penrod, with debonair
                        suavity, acted as curator, master of ceremonies, and lecturer. He greeted
                        the first to enter with a courtly bow. They consisted of Miss Rennsdale and
                        her nursery governess, and they paid spot cash for their admission.</p>

                    <p>Miss Rennsdale and governess were followed by Mr. Georgie Bassett and baby
                        sister (which proves the perfection of Georgie&apos;s character) and six

                        subsequent to Miss Rennsdale and governess, admission was wholly by pin.</p>

                        pointed to the I dachshund, and added, in his ordinary tone,
                        &quot;That&apos;s him.&quot; Straightway reassuming the
                        character of showman, he bellowed: &quot;<hi rend="i">Next,</hi> you see

                    <p>&quot;At the slightest <hi rend="i">pre</hi>-text!&quot; he repeated,
                        and continued, suiting the action to the word: &quot;I will now hammer

                        Herman and Verman. Their father got mad and stuck his pitchfork right inside
                        of another man, exactly as promised upon the advertisements outside the big
                        tent, and got put in jail. Look at them well, gen-til-mun and lay-deeze,

                        else, Herman. This is the only genuine <pb id="VAA2383-160" n="152"/>
                        one-fingered tattooed wild man. Last on the programme, gen-til-mun and
                        lay-deeze, we have Verman, the savage tattooed wild boy, that can&apos;t
                        speak only his native foreign languages. Talk some, Verman.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Verman obliged and made an instantaneous hit. He was encored rapturously,
                        again and again; and, thrilling with the unique pleasure of being
                        appreciated and misunderstood at the same time, would have talked all day
                        but too gladly. Sam Williams, however, with a true showman&apos;s
                        foresight, whispered to Penrod, who rang down on the monologue.</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Gen</hi>-til-mun and <hi rend="i">lay</hi>-deeze, this

                            <hi rend="i">Re-mem-bur</hi> the price is only one cent, the tenth part
                        of a dime, or twenty pins, no bent ones taken. Pray pass out quietly and
                        with as little jostling as possible. The Schofield and Williams Military
                        Band will play before each pufformance, and each and all are welcome for the

                    <pb id="VAA2383-161" n="153"/>
                    <p>Forthwith, the Schofield and Williams Military Band began a second overture,
                        in which something vaguely like a tune was at times distinguishable; and all
                        of the first audience returned, most of them having occupied the interval in
                        hasty excursions for more pins; Miss Rennsdale and governess, however, again
                        paying coin of the Republic and receiving deference and the best seats
                        accordingly. And when a third performance found all of the same inveterate
                        patrons once more crowding the auditorium, and seven recruits added, the
                        pleasurable excitement of the partners in their venture will be understood
                        by any one who has seen a metropolitan manager strolling about the foyer of
                        his theatre some evening during the earlier stages of an assured
                        &quot;phenomenal run.&quot;</p>
                    <p>From the first, there was no question which feature of the entertainment was
                        the attraction extraordinary: VermanVerman, the savage tattooed wild boy,
                        speaking only his native foreign languagesVerman was a triumph! Beaming,
                        wreathed in smiles, melodious, incredibly fluent, he had but to open his
                        lips and a dead hush fell upon the audience. Breathless, they leaned
                        forward, hanging upon his every semi-syllable, and, when Penrod checked the
                            <pb id="VAA2383-162" n="154"/> flow, burst into thunders of applause,
                        which Verman received with happy laughter.</p>
                    <p>Alas! he delayed not o&apos;er long to display all the egregiousness of a
                        new star; but for a time there was no caprice of his too eccentric to be
                        forgiven. During Penrod&apos;s lecture upon the other curios, the
                        tattooed wild boy continually stamped his foot, grinned, and gesticulated,
                        tapping his tiny chest, and pointing to himself as it were to say:
                        &quot;Wait for Me! I am the Big Show.&quot; So soon they learn; so
                        soon they learn! And (again alas!) this spoiled darling of public favour,
                        like many another, was fated to know, in good time, the fickleness of that
                        favour.</p>
                    <p>But during all the morning performances he was the idol of his audience and
                        looked it! The climax of his popularity came during the fifth overture of
                        the Schofield and Williams Military Band, when the music was quite drowned
                        in the agitated clamours of Miss Rennsdale, who was endeavouring to ascend
                        the stairs in spite of the physical dissuasion of her governess.</p>

                        screamed Miss Rennsdale, her voice accompanied by a sound of ripping.

                        obscurity, nor the last to champion its eloquence.</p>
                    <p>Verman was almost unendurable after this, but, like many, many other
                        managers, Schofield and Williams restrained their choler, and even laughed
                        fulsomely when their principal attraction essayed the rle of a comedian in
                        private, and capered and squawked in sheer, fatuous vanity.</p>
                    <p>The first performance of the afternoon rivalled the successes of the morning,
                        and although Miss Rennsdale was detained at home, thus drying up the single
                        source of cash income developed before lunch, Maurice Levy appeared,
                        escorting Marjorie Jones, and paid coin for two admissions, dropping the
                        money into Sam&apos;s hand with a carelessnay, a contemptuousgesture. At
                        sight of Marjorie, Penrod Schofield flushed under his new moustache
                        (repainted since noon) and lectured as he had never lectured before. A new
                        grace invested his every gesture; a new sonorousness rang in his voice; a
                        simple and manly pomposity marked his very walk as he passed from curio to
                        curio. And when he fear-lessly <pb id="VAA2383-165" n="157"/> handled the
                        box of rats and hammered upon it with cool <hi rend="i">insouciance,</hi> he
                        beheldfor the first time in his lifea purl of admiration eddying in
                        Marjorie&apos;s lovely eye, a certain softening of that eye. And then
                        Verman spakeand Penrod was forgotten. Marjorie&apos;s eye rested upon
                        him no more.</p>
                    <p>A heavily equipped chauffeur ascended the stairway, bearing the message that
                        Mrs. Levy awaited her son and his lady. Thereupon, having devoured the last
                        sound permitted (by the managers) to issue from Verman, Mr. Levy and Miss
                        Jones departed to a real matine at a real theatre, the limpid eyes of
                        Marjorie looking back softly over her shoulderbut only at the tattooed wild
                        boy. Nearly always it is woman who puts the irony into life.</p>
                    <p>After this, perhaps because of sated curiosity, perhaps on account of a pin
                        famine, the attendance began to languish. Only four responded to the next
                        call of the band; the four dwindled to three; finally the entertainment was
                        given for one <hi rend="i">blas</hi> auditor, and Schofield and Williams
                        looked depressed. Then followed an interval when the band played in vain.</p>
                    <p>About three o&apos;clock Schofield and Williams were <pb id="VAA2383-166"
                            n="158"/> gloomily discussing various unpromising devices for startling
                        the public into a renewal of interest, when another patron unexpectedly
                        appeared and paid a cent for his admission. News of the Big Show and Museum
                        of Curiosities had at last penetrated the far, cold spaces of interstellar
                        niceness, for this new patron consisted of no less than Roderick Magsworth
                        Bitts, Junior, escaped in a white &quot;sailor suit&quot; from the
                        Manor during a period of severe maternal and tutorial preoccupation.</p>
                    <p>He seated himself without parley, and the pufformance was offered for his
                        entertainment with admirable conscientiousness. True to the Lady Clara caste
                        and training, Roderick&apos;s pale, fat faceexpressed nothing except an
                        impervious superiority and, as he sat, cold and unimpressed upon the front
                        bench, like a large, white lump, it must be said that he made a discouraging
                        audience &quot;to play to.&quot; He was not, however,
                        unresponsivefar from it. He offered comment very chilling to the warm
                        grandiloquence of the orator.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s my uncle Ethelbert&apos;s dachshund,&quot;
                        he remarked, at the beginning of the lecture. &quot;You better take him
                        back if you don&apos;t want to get arrested.&quot; And when Penrod,
                        rather uneasily ignoring <pb id="VAA2383-167" n="159"/> the interruption,
                        proceeded to the exploitation of the genuine, full-blooded Indian dog, Duke,
                        &quot;Why don&apos;t you try to give that old dog away?&quot;
                        asked Roderick. &quot;You couldn&apos;t sell him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;My papa would buy me a lots better &apos;coon than
                        that,&quot; was the information volunteered a little later,
                        &quot;only I wouldn&apos;t want the nasty old thing.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Herman of the missing finger obtained no greater indulgence.
                        &quot;Pooh!&quot; said Roderick. &quot;We have two fox-terriers
                        in our stables that took prizes at the kennel show, and their tails were <hi
                            rend="i">bit</hi> off. There&apos;s a man that always bites
                        fox-terriers&apos; tails off.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, my gosh, what a lie!&quot; exclaimed Sam Williams
                        ignorantly. &quot;Go on with the show whether he likes it or not,
                        Penrod. He&apos;s paid his money.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Verman, confident in his own singular powers, chuckled openly at the failure
                        of the other attractions to charm the frosty visitor, and, when his turn
                        came, poured forth a torrent of conversation which was straightway dammed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Rotten,&quot; said Mr. Bitts languidly. &quot;Anybody could
                        talk like that. <hi rend="i">I</hi> could do it if I wanted to.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Verman paused suddenly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Yes,</hi> you could!&quot; exclaimed Penrod,
                        stung. &quot;Let&apos;s hear you do it, then.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-168" n="160"/>
                    <p>&quot;Yessir!&quot; the other partner shouted.
                        &quot;Let&apos;s just hear you <hi rend="i">do</hi> it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I said I could if I wanted to,&quot; responded Roderick.
                        &quot;I didn&apos;t say I <hi rend="i">would.&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>&quot;Yay! Knows he can&apos;t!&quot; sneered Sam.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can, too, if I try.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, let&apos;s hear you try!&quot;</p>
                    <p>So challenged, the visitor did try, but, in the absence of an impartial jury,
                        his effort was considered so pronounced a failure that he was howled down,
                        derided, and mocked with great clamours.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Anyway,&quot; said Roderick, when things had quieted down,
                        &quot;if I couldn&apos;t get up a better show than this I&apos;d
                        sell out and leave town.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Not having enough presence of mind to inquire what he would sell out, his
                        adversaries replied with mere formless yells of scorn.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I could get up a better show than this with my left hand,&quot;
                        Roderick asserted.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, what would you have in your ole show?&quot; asked Penrod,
                        condescending to language.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s all right, what I&apos;d <hi rend="i"
                        >have.</hi> I&apos;d have enough!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You couldn&apos;t get Herman and Verman in <hi rend="i"
                        >you?</hi> ole show.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, and I wouldn&apos;t want &apos;em, either!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-169" n="161"/>
                    <p>&quot;Well, what <hi rend="i">would</hi> you have?&quot; insisted
                        Penrod derisively. &quot;You&apos;d have to have <hi rend="i"
                            >sumpthing</hi>you couldn&apos;t be a show yourself!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How do you know?&quot; This was but meandering while waiting
                        for ideas, and evoked another yell.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You think you could be a show all by yourself?&quot; demanded
                        Penrod.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How do <hi rend="i">you</hi> know I couldn&apos;t?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Two white boys and two black boys shrieked their scorn of the boaster.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I could, too!&quot; Roderick raised his voice to a sudden howl,
                        obtaining a hearing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, why don&apos;t you tell us how?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, <hi rend="i">I</hi> know <hi rend="i">how,</hi> all
                        right,&quot; said Roderick. &quot;If anybody asks you, you can just
                        tell him I know <hi rend="i">how,</hi> all right.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, you can&apos;t <hi rend="i">do</hi> anything,&quot;
                        Sam began argumentatively. &quot;You talk about being a show all by
                        yourself; what could you try to do? Show us sumpthing you can do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I didn&apos;t say I was going to <hi rend="i">do</hi>
                        anything,&quot; returned the badgered one, still evading.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, then, how&apos;d you <hi rend="i">be</hi> a
                        show?&quot; Penrod demanded. &quot;<hi rend="i">We</hi> got a show
                        here, even if Herman didn&apos;t point or Verman didn&apos;t talk.
                        Their father <pb id="VAA2383-170" n="162"/> stabbed a man with a pitchfork,
                        I guess, didn&apos;t he?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How do <hi rend="i">I</hi> know?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I guess he&apos;s in jail, ain&apos;t he?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, what if their father is in jail? I didn&apos;t say he
                        wasn&apos;t, did I?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, <hi rend="i">your</hi> father ain&apos;t in jail, is
                        he?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I never said he was, did I?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, then,&quot; continued Penrod, &quot;how could you be
                        a&quot; He stopped abruptly, staring at Roderick, the birth of an idea
                        plainly visible in his altered expression. He had suddenly remembered his
                        intention to ask Roderick Magsworth Bitts, Junior, about Rena Magsworth, and
                        this recollection collided in his mind with the irritation produced by
                        Roderick&apos;s claiming some mysterious attainment which would warrant
                        his setting up as a show in his single person, Penrod&apos;s whole
                        manner changed instantly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Roddy,&quot; he asked, almost overwhelmed by a prescience of
                        something vast and magnificent, &quot;Roddy, are you any relation of
                        Rena Magsworth?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Roderick had never heard of Rena Magsworth, although a concentration of the
                        sentence yesterday pronounced upon her had burned, black and horrific, upon
                        the face of every newspaper in the country. <pb id="VAA2383-171" n="163"/>
                        He was not allowed to read the journals of the day and his family&apos;s
                        indignation over the sacrilegious coincidence of the name had not been
                        expressed in his presence. But he saw that it was an awesome name to Penrod
                        Schofield and Samuel Williams. Even Herman and Verman, though lacking many
                        educational advantages on account of a long residence in the country, were
                        informed on the subject of Rena Magsworth through hearsay, and they joined
                        in the portentous silence.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Roddy,&quot; repeated Penrod, &quot;honest, is Rena
                        Magsworth some relation of yours?&quot;</p>
                    <p>There is no obsession more dangerous to its victims than a
                        convictionespecially an inherited oneof superiority: this world is so full
                        of Missourians. And from his earliest years Roderick Magsworth Bitts,
                        Junior, had been trained to believe in the importance of the Magsworth
                        family. At every meal he absorbed a sense of Magsworth greatness, and yet,
                        in his infrequent meetings with persons of his own age and sex, he was
                        treated as negligible. Now, dimly, he perceived that there was a Magsworth
                        claim of some sort which was impressive, even to boys. Magsworth blood was
                        the essential of all true distinction in the world, he knew. Consequently,
                            <pb id="VAA2383-172" n="164"/> having been driven into a <hi rend="i"
                            >cul-de-sac,</hi> as a result of flagrant and unfounded boasting, he was
                        ready to take advantage of what appeared to be a triumphal way out.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Roddy,&quot; said Penrod again, with solemnity, &quot;is
                        Rena Magsworth some relation of yours?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Is</hi> she, Roddy?&quot; asked Sam, almost
                        hoarsely.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She&apos;s my aunt!&quot; shouted Roddy.</p>
                    <p>Silence followed. Sam and Penrod, spellbound, gazed upon Roderick Magsworth
                        Bitts, Junior. So did Herman and Verman. Roddy&apos;s staggering lie had
                        changed the face of things utterly. No one questioned it; no one realized
                        that it was much too good to be true.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Roddy,&quot; said Penrod, in a voice tremulous with hope,
                        &quot;Roddy, will you join our show?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Roddy joined.</p>
                    <p>Even he could see that the offer implied his being starred as the paramount
                        attraction of a new order of things. It was obvious that he had swelled out
                        suddenly, in the estimation of the other boys, to that importance which he
                        had been taught to believe his native gift and natural right. The sensation
                        was pleasant. He had often been treated with effusion by grown-up callers
                        and by acquaintances of his <pb id="VAA2383-173" n="165"/> mothers and
                        sisters; he had heard ladies speak of him as &quot;charming&quot;
                        and &quot;that delightful child,&quot; and little girls had
                        sometimes shown him deference, but until this moment no boy had ever allowed
                        him, for one moment, to presume even to equality. Now, in a trice, he was
                        not only admitted to comradeship, but patently valued as something rare and
                        sacred to be acclaimed and pedestalled. In fact, the very first thing that
                        Schofield and Williams did was to find a box for him to stand upon.</p>
                    <p>The misgivings roused in Roderick&apos;s bosom by the subsequent
                        activities of the firm were not bothersome enough to make him forego his
                        prominence as Exhibit A. He was not a &quot;quick-minded&quot; boy,
                        and it was long (and much happened) before he thoroughly comprehended the
                        causes of his new celebrity. He had a shadowy feeling that if the affair
                        came to be heard of at home it might not be liked, but, intoxicated by the
                        glamour and bustle which surround a public character, he made no protest. On
                        the contrary, he entered whole-heartedly into the preparations for the new
                        show. Assuming, with Sam&apos;s assistance, a blue moustache and
                        &quot;sideburns,&quot; he helped in the painting of a new poster,
                        which, supplanting the old one on the wall <pb id="VAA2383-174" n="166"/> of
                        the stable facing the cross-street, screamed blood, murder at the passers in
                        that rather populous thoroughfare.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="b">M</hi>EGAPHONES were constructed out of heavy wrapping-paper,
                        and Penrod, Sam, and Herman set out in different directions, delivering
                        vocally the inflammatory proclamation of the poster to a large section of
                        the residential quarter, and leaving Roderick Magsworth Bitts, Junior, with
                        Verman in the loft, shielded from all deadhead eyes. Upon the return of the
                        heralds, the Schofield and Williams Military Band played deafeningly, and an
                        awakened public once more thronged to fill the coffers of the firm.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-176" n="168"/>
                    <p>Prosperity smiled again. The very first audience after the acquisition of
                        Roderick was larger than the largest of the morning. Master Bittsthe only
                        exhibit placed upon a boxwas a supercurio. All eyes fastened upon him and
                        remained, hungrily feasting, throughout Penrod&apos;s luminous oration.</p>
                    <p>But the glory of one light must ever be the dimming of another. We dwell in a
                        vale of seesawsand cobwebs spin fastest upon laurel. Verman, the tattooed
                        wild boy, speaking only in his native foreign languages, Verman the gay,
                        Verman the caperer, capered no more; he chuckled no more, he beckoned no
                        more, nor tapped his chest, nor wreathed his idolatrous face in smiles.
                        Gone, all gone, were his little artifices for attracting the general
                        attention to himself; gone was every engaging mannerism which had endeared
                        him to the mercurial public. He squatted against the wall and glowered at
                        the new sensation. It was the old storythe old, old story of too much
                        temperament: Verman was suffering from artistic jealousy.</p>
                    <p>The second audience contained a cash-paying adult, a spectacled young man
                        whose poignant attention was very flattering. He remained after the lecture,
                        and put a few questions to Roddy, which <pb id="VAA2383-177" n="169"/> were
                        answered rather confusedly upon promptings from Penrod. The young man went
                        away without having stated the object of his interrogations, but it became
                        quite plain, later in the day. This same object the spectacled young man to
                        make several brief but stimulating calls directly after leaving the
                        Schofield and Williams Big Show, and the consequences thereof loitered not
                        by the wayside.</p>
                    <p>The Big Show was at high tide. Not only was the auditorium filled and
                        throbbing; there was an indubitable lineby no means wholly juvenilewaiting
                        for admission to the next pufformance. A group stood in the street examining
                        the poster earnestly as it glowed in the long, slanting rays of the westward
                        sun, and people in automobiles and other vehicles had halted wheel in the
                        street to read the message so piquantly given to the world. These were the
                        conditions when a crested victoria arrived at a gallop, and a large,
                        chastely magnificent and highly flushed woman descended, and progressed
                        across the yard with an air of violence.</p>
                    <p>At sight of her, the adults of the waiting line hastily disappeared, and most
                        of the pausing vehicles moved instantly on their way. She was followed by a
                        stricken man in livery.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-178" n="170"/>
                    <p>The stairs to the auditorium were narrow and steep; Mrs. Roderick Magsworth
                        Bitts was of a stout favour; and the voice of Penrod was audible during the
                        ascent.</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Re-mem-bur,</hi> gentilmun and lay-deeze, each and all
                        are now gazing upon Roderick Magsworth Bitts, Junior, the only living nephew
                        of the great Rena Magsworth. She stuck ars&apos;nic in the milk of eight
                        separate and distinck people to put in their coffee and each and all of
                        &apos;em died. The great ars&apos;nic murderess, Rena Magsworth,
                        gentilmun and lay-deeze, and Roddy&apos;s her only living nephew.
                        She&apos;s a relation of all the Bitts family, but he&apos;s her one
                        and only living nephew. Re-<hi rend="i">mem</hi>-bur! Next July
                        she&apos;s goin&apos; to be hung, and, each and all, you now see
                        before you&quot;</p>
                    <p>Penrod paused abruptly, seeing something before himselfthe august and awful
                        presence which filled the entryway. And his words (it should be related)
                        froze upon his lips.</p>
                    <p>Before <hi rend="i">herself,</hi> Mrs. Roderick Magsworth Bitts saw her
                        sonher scionwearing a moustache and sideburns of blue, and perched upon a
                        box flanked by Sherman and Verman, the Michigan rats, the Indian dog Duke,
                        Herman, and the dog part alligator.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-179" n="171"/>
                    <p>Roddy, also, saw something before himself. It needed no prophet to read the
                        countenance of the dread apparition in the entryway. His mouth
                        openedremained openthen filled to capacity with a calamitous sound of grief
                        not unmingled with apprehension.</p>
                    <p>Penrod&apos;s reason staggered under the crisis. For a horrible moment he
                        saw Mrs. Roderick Magsworth Bitts approaching like some fatal mountain in
                        avalanche. She seemed to grow larger and redder; lightnings played about her
                        head; he had a vague consciousness of the audience spraying out in flight,
                        of the squealings, tramplings and dispersals of a stricken field. The
                        mountain was close upon him</p>
                    <p>He stood by the open mouth of the hay-chute which went through the floor to
                        the manger below. Penrod also went through the floor. He propelled himself
                        into the chute and shot down, but not quite to the manger, for Mr. Samuel
                        Williams had thoughtfully stepped into the chute a moment in advance of his
                        partner. Penrod lit upon Sam.</p>
                    <p>Catastrophic noises resounded in the loft; volcanoes seemed to romp upon the
                        stairway.</p>
                    <p>There ensued a period when only a shrill keening <pb id="VAA2383-180" n="172"
                        /> marked the passing of Roderick as he was borne to the tumbril. Then all
                        was silence.</p>
                    <p>. . . Sunset, striking through a western window, rouged the walls of the
                        Schofields&apos; library, where gathered a joint family council and
                        court martial of fourMrs. Schofield, Mr. Schofield, and Mr. and Mrs.
                        Williams, parents of Samuel of that ilk. Mr. Williams read aloud a
                        conspicuous passage from the last edition of the evening paper:
                        &quot;Prominent people here believed close relations of woman sentenced
                        to hang. Angry denial by Mrs. R. Magsworth Bitts. Relationship admitted by
                        younger member of family. His statement confirmed by boy-friends&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t!&quot; said Mrs. Williams, addressing her
                        husband vehemently. &quot;We&apos;ve all read it a dozen times.
                        We&apos;ve got plenty of trouble on our hands without hearing <hi
                            rend="i">that</hi> again!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Singularly enough, Mrs. Williams did not look troubled; she looked as if she
                        were trying to look troubled. Mrs. Schofield wore a similar expression. So
                        did Mr. Schofield. So did Mr. Williams.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What did she say when she called <hi rend="i">you</hi>
                        up?&quot; Mrs. Schofield inquired breathlessly of Mrs. Williams.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-181" n="173"/>
                    <p>&quot;She could hardly speak at first, and then when she did talk, she
                        talked so fast I couldn&apos;t understand most of it, and&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It was just the same when she tried to talk to me,&quot; said
                        Mrs. Schofield, nodding.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I never did hear any one in such a state before,&quot;
                        continued Mrs. Williams. &quot;So furious&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Quite justly, of course,&quot; said Mrs. Schofield.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course. And she said Penrod and Sam had enticed Roderick away
                        from homeusually he&apos;s not allowed to go outside the yard except
                        with his tutor or a servantand had told him to say that horrible creature
                        was his aunt&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How in the world do you suppose Sam and Penrod ever thought of such
                        a thing as <hi rend="i">that!&quot;</hi> exclaimed Mrs. Schofield.
                        &quot;It must have been made up just for their &apos;show.&apos;
                        Della says there were just <hi rend="i">streams</hi> going in and out all
                        day. Of course it wouldn&apos;t have happened, but this was the day
                        Margaret and I spend every month in the country with Aunt Sarah, and I
                        didn&apos;t <hi rend="i">dream</hi>&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She said one thing I thought rather tactless,&quot; interrupted
                        Mrs. Williams. &quot;Of course we must allow for her being dreadfully
                        excited and wrought up, but I do think it wasn&apos;t quite delicate in
                        her, <pb id="VAA2383-182" n="174"/> and she&apos;s usually the very soul
                        of delicacy. She said that Roderick had <hi rend="i">never</hi> been allowed
                        to associate withcommon boys&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Meaning Sam and Penrod,&quot; said Mrs. Schofield.
                        &quot;Yes, she said that to me, too.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She said that the most awful thing about it,&quot; Mrs.
                        Williams went on, &quot;was that, though she&apos;s going to
                        prosecute the newspapers, many people would always believe the story,
                        and&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I imagine they will,&quot; said Mrs. Schofield musingly.
                        &quot;Of course you and I and everybody who really knows the Bitts and
                        Magsworth families understand the perfect absurdity of it; but I suppose
                        there are ever so many who&apos;ll believe it, no matter what the
                        Bittses and Magsworths say.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hundreds and hundreds!&quot; said Mrs. Williams.
                        &quot;I&apos;m afraid it will be a great come-down for
                        them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m afraid so,&quot; said Mrs. Schofield gently.
                        &quot;A very great oneyes, a very, very great one.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; observed Mrs. Williams, after a thoughtful pause,
                        &quot;there&apos;s only one thing to be done, and I suppose it had
                        better be done right away.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She glanced toward the two gentlemen.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Certainly,&quot; Mr. Schofield agreed. &quot;But where <hi
                            rend="i">are</hi> they?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-183" n="175"/>
                    <p>&quot;Have you looked in the stable?&quot; asked his wife.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I searched it. They&apos;ve probably started for the
                        &quot;West.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did you look in the sawdust-box?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, I didn&apos;t.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then that&apos;s where they are.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Thus, in the early twilight, the now historic stable was approached by two
                        fathers charged to do the only thing to be done. They entered the storeroom.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Penrod!&quot; said Mr. Schofield.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sam!&quot; said Mr. Williams.</p>
                    <p>Nothing disturbed the twilight hush.</p>
                    <p>But by means of a ladder, brought from the carriage-house, Mr. Schofield
                        mounted to the top of the sawdust-box. He looked within, and discerned the
                        dim outlines of three quiet figures, the third being that of a small dog.</p>
                    <p>The two boys rose, upon command, descended the ladder after Mr. Schofield,
                        bringing Duke with them, and stood before the authors of their being, who
                        bent upon them sinister and threatening brows. With hanging heads and
                        despondent countenances, each still ornamented with a moustache and an
                        imperial, Penrod and Sam awaited sentence.</p>
                    <p>This is a boy&apos;s lot: anything he does, anything <pb id="VAA2383-184"
                            n="176"/> whatever, may afterward turn out to have been a crimehe never
                        knows.</p>
                    <p>And punishment and clemency are alike inexplicable.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Williams took his son by the ear.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You march home!&quot; he commanded.</p>
                    <p>Sam marched, not looking back, and his father followed the small figure
                        implacably.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You goin&apos; to whip me?&quot; quavered Penrod, alone
                        with Justice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wash your face at that hydrant,&quot; said his father sternly.</p>
                    <p>About fifteen minutes later, Penrod, hurriedly entering the corner drug
                        store, two blocks distant, was astonished to perceive a familiar form at the
                        soda counter.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yay, Penrod,&quot; said Sam Williams. &quot;Want some sody?
                        Come on. He didn&apos;t lick me. He didn&apos;t do anything to me at
                        all. He gave me a quarter.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So&apos;d mine,&quot; said Penrod.</p>

                        <hi rend="b">B</hi>OYHOOD is the longest time in lifefor a boy. The last
                        term of the school-year is made of decades, not of weeks, and living through
                        them is like waiting for the millennium. But they do pass, somehow, and at
                        last there came a day when Penrod was one of a group that capered out from
                        the gravelled yard of &quot;Ward School, Nomber Seventh,&quot;
                        carolling a leave-taking of the institution, of their instructress, and not
                        even forgetting Mr. Capps, the janitor.</p>
                    <lg>
                        <l n="1">&quot;Good-bye, teacher! Good-bye, school!</l>
                        <l n="2">Good-bye, Cappsie, dern ole fool!&quot;</l>

                    <pb id="VAA2383-186" n="178"/>
                    <p>Penrod sang the loudest. For every boy, there is an age when he
                        &quot;finds his voice.&quot; Penrod&apos;s had not
                        &quot;changed,&quot; but he had found it. Inevitably that thing had
                        come upon his family and the neighbours; and his father, a somewhat
                        dyspeptic man, quoted frequently the expressive words of the &quot;Lady
                        of Shalott,&quot; but there were others whose sufferings were as
                        poignant.</p>
                    <p>Vacation-time warmed the young of the world to pleasant languor; and a
                        morning came that was like a brightly coloured picture in a child&apos;s
                        fairy story. Miss Margaret Schofield, reclining in a hammock upon the front
                        porch, was beautiful in the eyes of a newly made senior, well favoured and
                        in fair raiment, beside her. A guitar rested lightly upon his knee, and he
                        was trying to playa matter of some difficulty, as the floor of the porch
                        also seemed inclined to be musical. From directly under his feet came a
                        voice of song, shrill, loud, incredibly piercing and incredibly flat,
                        dwelling upon each syllable with incomprehensible reluctance to leave it.</p>

                    <pb id="VAA2383-187" n="179"/>
                    <p>Miss Schofield stamped heartily upon the musical floor.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s Penrod,&quot; she explained. &quot;The
                        lattice at the end of the porch is loose, and he crawls under and comes out
                        all bugs. He&apos;s been having a dreadful singing fit latelyrunning
                        away to picture shows and vaudeville, I suppose.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mr. Robert Williams looked upon her yearningly. He touched a thrilling chord
                        on his guitar and leaned nearer. &quot;But you said you <hi rend="i"
                            >have</hi> missed me,&quot; he began. &quot;I&quot;</p>
                    <p>The voice of Penrod drowned all other sounds.</p>
                    <lg>
                        <l n="1">&quot;So-o-o rem-mem-bur, whi-i-ilst you&apos;re young,</l>

                        <hi rend="i">&quot;Penrod!&quot;</hi> Miss Schofield stamped again.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You <hi rend="i">did</hi> say you&apos;d missed me,&quot;
                        said Mr. Robert Williams, seizing hurriedly upon the silence.
                        &quot;Didn&apos;t you say&quot;</p>
                    <p>A livelier tune rose upward.</p>
                    <lg>
                        <l n="1">&quot;Oh, you talk about your fascinating beauties,</l>

                    </lg>
                    <p>Margaret rose and jumped up and down repeatedly in a well-calculated area,
                        whereupon the voice of Penrod cried chokedly, <hi rend="i"
                        >&quot;Quit</hi> that!&quot; and there were subterranean coughings
                        and sneezings.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You want to choke a person to death?&quot; he inquired
                        severely, appearing at the end of the porch, a cobweb upon his brow. And,
                        continuing, he put into practice a newly acquired phrase, &quot;You
                        better learn to be more considerick of other people&apos;s
                        comfort.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Slowly and grievedly he withdrew, passed to the sunny side of the house,
                        reclined in the warm grass beside his wistful Duke, and presently sang
                        again.</p>

                        <l n="1">&quot;She&apos;s sweeter far than the flower I named her

                    <p>Mr. Schofield appeared at an open window upstairs, a book in his hand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Stop it!&quot; he commanded. &quot;Can&apos;t I stay
                        home <pb id="VAA2383-189" n="181"/> with a headache <hi rend="i">one</hi>
                        morning from the office without having to listen toI never <hi rend="i"
                        >did</hi> hear such squawking!&quot; He retired from the window, having
                        too impulsively called upon his Maker. Penrod, shocked and injured, entered
                        the house, but presently his voice was again audible as far as the front
                        porch. He was holding converse with his mother, somewhere in the interior.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, what of it? Sam Williams told me his mother said if Bob ever
                        did think of getting married to Margaret, his mother said she&apos;d
                        like to know what in the name o&apos; goodness they expect to&quot;</p>
                    <p>Bang! Margaret thought it better to close the front door.</p>
                    <p>The next minute Penrod opened it. &quot;I suppose you want the whole
                        family to get a sunstroke,&quot; he said reprovingly.
                        &quot;Keepin&apos; every breath of air out o&apos; the house on
                        a day like this!&quot;</p>
                    <p>And he sat down implacably in the doorway.</p>
                    <p>The serious poetry of all languages has omitted the little brother; and yet
                        he is one of the great trials of lovethe immemorial burden of courtship.
                        Tragedy should have found place for him, but he has been left to the
                        haphazard vignettist of Grub Street. He is the grave and real menace of
                        lovers; <pb id="VAA2383-190" n="182"/> his head is sacred and terrible, his
                        power illimitable. There is one wayonly oneto deal with him; but Robert
                        Williams, having a brother of Penrod&apos;s age, understood that way.</p>
                    <p>Robert had one dollar in the world. He gave it to Penrod immediately.</p>
                    <p>Enslaved forever, the new Rockefeller rose and went forth upon the highway,
                        an overflowing heart bursting the floodgates of song.</p>

                    <p>In fairness, it must be called to mind that boys older than Penrod have these
                        wellings of pent melody; a wife can never tell when she is to undergo a
                        musical morning, and even the golden wedding brings her no security, a man
                        of ninety is liable to bust-loose in song, any time.</p>

                        passed down the street, singing his way into the heart&apos;s deepest

                    <p>He had reached his journey&apos;s end, a junk-dealer&apos;s shop
                        wherein lay the long-desired treasure of his soul-an accordion which might
                        have possessed a high quality of interest for an antiquarian, being
                        unquestionably a ruin, beautiful in decay, and quite beyond the sacrilegious
                        reach of the restorer. But it was still able to disgorge soundsloud,
                        strange, compelling sounds, which could be heard for a remarkable distance
                        in all directions; and it had one rich calf-like tone that had gone to
                        Penrod&apos;s heart. He obtained the instrument for twenty-two cents, a
                        price long since agreed upon with the junk-dealer. <pb id="VAA2383-192"

                    <p>With this purchase suspended from his shoulder by a faded green cord, Penrod
                        set out in a somewhat homeward direction, but not by the route he had just
                        travelled, though his motive for the change was not humanitarian. It was his
                        desire to display himself thus troubadouring to the gaze of Marjorie Jones.
                        Heralding his advance by continuous experiments in the music of the future,
                        he pranced upon his blithesome way, the faithful Duke at his heels. (It was
                        easier for Duke than it would have been for a younger dog, because, with
                        advancing age, he had begun to grow a little deaf.)</p>
                    <p>Turning the corner nearest to the glamoured mansion of the Joneses, the boy
                        jongleur came suddenly face to face with Marjorie, and, in the delicious
                        surprise of the encounter, ceased to play, his hands, in agitation, falling
                        from the instrument.</p>
                    <p>Bareheaded, the sunshine glorious upon her amber curls, Marjorie was
                        strolling hand-in-hand with her baby brother, Mitchell, four years old. She
                        wore pink that dayunforgettable pink, with a broad, black patent-leather
                        belt, shimmering reflections dancing upon its surface. How beautiful she
                        was!</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-193" n="185"/>
                    <p>How sacred the sweet little baby brother, whose privilege it was to cling to
                        that small hand, delicately powdered with freckles.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hello, Marjorie,&quot; said Penrod, affecting carelessness.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hello!&quot; said Marjorie, with unexpected cordiality. She
                        bent over her baby brother with motherly affectations. &quot;Say
                        &apos;howdy&apos; to the gentymuns, Mitchy-Mitch,&quot; she
                        urged sweetly, turning him to face Penrod.</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Won&apos;t!</hi>&quot; said Mitchy-Mitch, and,
                        to emphasize his refusal, kicked the gentymuns upon the shin.</p>
                    <p>Penrod&apos;s feelings underwent instant change, and in the sole
                        occupation of disliking Mitchy-Mitch, he wasted precious seconds which might
                        have been better employed in philosophic consideration of the startling
                        example, just afforded, of how a given law operates throughout the universe
                        in precisely the same manner perpetually. Mr. Robert Williams would have
                        understood this, easily.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, oh!&quot; Marjorie cried, and put Mitchy-Mitch behind her
                        with too much sweetness. &quot;Maurice Levy&apos;s gone to Atlantic
                        City with his mamma,&quot; she remarked conversationally, as if the
                        kicking incident were quite closed.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-194" n="186"/>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s nothin&apos;,&quot; returned Penrod,
                        keeping his eye uneasily upon Mitchy-Mitch. &quot;I know plenty people
                        been better places than thatChicago and everywhere.&quot;</p>
                    <p>There was unconscious ingratitude in his low rating of Atlantic City, for it
                        was largely to the attractions of that resort he owed Miss Jones&apos;
                        present attitude of friendliness. Of course, too, she was curious about the
                        accordion. It would be dastardly to hint that she had noticed a paper bag
                        which bulged the pocket of Penrod&apos;s coat, and yet this bag was
                        undeniably conspicuous&quot;and children are very like grown people
                        sometimes!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Penrod brought forth the bag, purchased on the way at a drug store, and till
                        this moment <hi rend="i">unopened,</hi> which expresses in a word the depth
                        of his sentiment for Marjorie. It contained an abundant
                        fifteen-cents&apos; worth of lemon drops, jaw-breakers, licorice sticks,
                        cinnamon drops, and shopworn choclate creams.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Take all you want,&quot; he said, with off-hand generosity.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, Penrod Schofield,&quot; exclaimed the wholly thawed
                        damsel, &quot;you nice boy!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, that&apos;s nothin&apos;,&quot; he returned airily,
                        &quot;I got a good deal of money, nowadays.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-195" n="187"/>
                    <p>&quot;Where from?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ohjust around.&quot; With a cautious gesture he offered a
                        jaw-breaker to Mitchy-Mitch, who snatched it indignantly and set about its
                        absorption without delay.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Can you play on that?&quot; asked Marjorie, with some
                        difficulty, her cheeks being rather too hilly for conversation.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Want to hear me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She nodded, her eyes sweet with anticipation.</p>
                    <p>This was what he had come for. He threw back his head, lifted his eyes
                        dreamily, as he had seen real musicians lift theirs, and distended the
                        accordion preparing to produce the wonderful calf-like noise which was the
                        instrument&apos;s great charm. But the distention evoked a long wail
                        which was at once drowned in another one.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ow! Owowaoh! Wowohah! Waow<hi rend="i">wow</hi>!&quot; shrieked
                        Mitchy-Mitch and the accordion together.</p>
                    <p>Mitchy-Mitch, to emphasize his disapproval of the accordion, opening his
                        mouth still wider, lost therefrom the jaw-breaker, which rolled in the dust.
                        Weeping, he stooped to retrieve it, and Marjorie, to prevent him, hastily
                        set her foot upon it. Penrod offered another jaw-breaker; but Mitchy-Mitch
                            <pb id="VAA2383-196" n="188"/> struck it from his hand, desiring the
                        former, which had convinced him of its sweetness.</p>
                    <p>Marjorie moved inadvertently; whereupon Mitchy-Mitch pounced upon the remains
                        of his jaw-breaker and restored them, with accretions, to his mouth. His
                        sister, uttering a cry of horror, sprang to the rescue, assisted by Penrod,
                        whom she prevailed upon to hold Mitchy-Mitch&apos;s mouth open while she
                        excavated. This operation being completed, and Penrod&apos;s right thumb
                        severely bitten, Mitchy-Mitch closed his eyes tightly, stamped, squealed,
                        bellowed, wrung his hands, and then, unexpectedly, kicked Penrod again.</p>
                    <p>Penrod put a hand in his pocket and drew forth a copper two-cent piece,
                        large, round, and fairly bright.</p>
                    <p>He gave it to Mitchy-Mitch.</p>
                    <p>Mitchy-Mitch immediately stopped crying and gazed upon his benefactor with
                        the eyes of a dog.</p>
                    <p>This world!</p>
                    <p>Thereafter did Penrodwith complete approval from Mitchy-Mitchplay the
                        accordion for his lady to his heart&apos;s content, and hers. Never had
                        he so won upon her; never had she let him feel so close to her before. They
                        strolled up and down upon the sidewalk, eating, one thought between them,
                            <pb id="VAA2383-197" n="[189]"/>
                        <figure entity="VAA2383-8">

                        <pb id="VAA2383-198" n="190"/> and soon she had learned to play the
                        accordion almost as well as he. So passed a happy hour, which the Good King
                        Ren of Anjou would have envied them, while Mitchy-Mitch made friends with
                        Duke, romped about his sister and her swain, and clung to the hand of the
                        latter, at intervals, with fondest affection and trust.</p>
                    <p>The noon whistles failed to disturb this little Arcady; only the sound of
                        Mrs. Jones&apos; voicefor the third time summoning Marjorie and
                        Mitchy-Mitch to lunchsent Penrod on his way.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I could come back this afternoon, I guess,&quot; he said, in
                        parting.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m not goin&apos; to be here. I&apos;m
                        goin&apos; to Baby Rennsdale&apos;s party.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Penrod looked blank, as she intended he should Having thus satisfied herself,
                        she added:</p>
                    <p>&quot;There aren&apos;t goin&apos; to be any boys
                        there.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He was instantly radiant again.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Marjorie&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hum?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you wish I was goin&apos; to be there?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She looked shy, and turned away her head.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">&quot;Marjorie Jones!&quot;</hi> (This was a voice from
                        home.)</p>

                        <hi rend="i">&quot;How many more times shall I have to call

                    <p>Marjorie moved away, her face still hidden from Penrod.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you?&quot; he urged.</p>
                    <p>At the gate, she turned quickly toward him, and said over her shouder, all in
                        a breath: &quot;Yes! Come again to-morrow morning and I&apos;ll be
                        on the corner. Bring your&apos; cordion!&quot;</p>
                    <p>And she ran into the house, Mitchy-Mitch waving a loving hand to the boy on

                        were a long procession; and he made enough noise to render the auricular
                        part of the illusion perfect. His own family were already at the lunch-table
                        when he arrived, and the parade halted only at the door of the dining-room.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh <hi rend="i">Something!&quot;</hi> shouted Mr. Schofield,
                        clasping his bilious brow with both hands, &quot;Stop that noise!
                        Isn&apos;t it awful enough for you to <hi rend="i">sing?</hi> Sit <hi

                        out of the dining-room and throw it in the ash-can! Where did you get
                        it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where did I get what, papa?&quot; asked Penrod meekly,
                        depositing the accordion in the hall just outside the dining-room door.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That dathat third-hand concertina.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s a &apos;cordian,&quot; said Penrod, taking
                        his place at the table, and noticing that both Margaret and Mr. Robert
                        Williams (who happened to be a guest) were growing red.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t care what you call it,&quot; said Mr.
                        Schofield irritably. &quot;I want to know where you got it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Penrod&apos;s eyes met Margaret&apos;s: hers had a strained
                        expression. She very slightly shook her head. Penrod sent Mr. Williams a
                        grateful look, and Penrod sent Mr. Williams a grateful look, and might have
                        been startled if he could have seen himself in a mirror at that moment; for
                        he regarded Mitchy-Mitch with concealed but vigorous aversion, and the
                        resemblance would have horrified him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A man gave it to me,&quot; he answered gently, and was rewarded
                        by the visibly regained ease of his patron&apos;s manner, while Margaret
                        leaned back in her chair and looked at her brother with real devotion.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-202" n="194"/>
                    <p>&quot;I should think he&apos;d have been glad to,&quot; said Mr.
                        Schofield. &quot;Who was he?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sir?&quot; In spite of the candy which he had consumed in
                        company with Marjorie and Mitchy-Mitch, Penrod had begun to eat lobster
                        croquettes earnestly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who <hi rend="i">was</hi> he?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who do you mean, papa?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The man that gave you that ghastly Thing!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yessir. A man gave it to me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I say, Who <hi rend="i">was</hi> he?&quot; shouted Mr.
                        Schofield.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I was just walking along, and the man came up to meit was
                        right down in front of Colgates&apos;, where most of the
                        paint&apos;s rubbed off the fence&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Penrod!&quot; The father used his most dangerous tone.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sir?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who was the man that gave you the concertina?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know. I was walking along&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You never saw him before?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, sir. I was just walk&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That will do,&quot; said Mr. Schofield, rising. &quot;I
                        suppose every family has its secret enemies and this was one of ours. I must
                        ask to be excused!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-203" n="195"/>
                    <p>With that, he went out crossly, stopping in the hall a moment before passing
                        beyond hearing. And, after lunch, Penrod sought in vain for his accordion;
                        he even searched the library where his father sat reading, though, upon
                        inquiry, Penrod explained that he was looking for a misplaced school-book.
                        He thought he ought to study a little every day, he said, even during
                        vacation-time. Much pleased, Mr. Schofield rose and joined the search,
                        finding the missing work on mathematics with singular easewhich cost him
                        precisely the price of the book the following September.</p>
                    <p>Penrod departed to study in the backyard. There, after a cautious survey of
                        the neighbourhood, he managed to dislodge the iron cover of the cistern, and
                        dropped the arithmetic within. A fine splash rewarded his listening ear.
                        Thus assured that when he looked for that book again no one would find it
                        for him, he replaced the cover, and betook himself pensively to the highway,
                        discouraging Duke from following by repeated volleys of stones, some
                        imaginary and others all too real.</p>
                    <p>Distant strains of brazen horns and the thobbing of drums were borne to him
                        upon the kind breeze, reminding him that the world was made for joy, <pb
                            id="VAA2383-204" n="196"/> and that the Barzee and Potter Dog and Pony
                        Show was exhibiting in a banlieue not far away. So, thither he bent his
                        stepsthe plentiful funds in his pocket burning hot holes all the way. He had
                        paid twenty-two cents for the accordion, and fifteen for candy; he had
                        bought the mercenary heart of Mitchy-Mitch for two: it certainly follows
                        that there remained to him of his dollar, sixty-one centsa fair fortune, and
                        most unusual.</p>
                    <p>Arrived upon the populous and festive scene of the Dog and Pony Show, he
                        first turned his attention to the brightly decorated booths which surrounded
                        the tent. The cries of the peanut vendors, of the popcorn men, of the
                        toy-balloon sellers, the stirring music of the band, playing before the
                        performance to attract a crowd, the shouting of excited children and the
                        barking of the dogs within the tent, all sounded exhilaratingly in
                        Penrod&apos;s ears and set his blood a-tingle. Nevertheless, he did not
                        squander his money or fling it to the winds in one grand splurge. Instead,
                        he began cautiously with the purchase of an extraordinarily large pickle,
                        which he obtained from an aged negress for his odd cent, too obvious a
                        bargain to be missed. At an adjacent stand he bought a glass of raspberry
                        lemonade (so <pb id="VAA2383-205" n="197"/> alleged) and sipped it as he ate
                        the pickle. He left nothing of either.</p>
                    <p>Next, he entered a small restaurant-tent and <unclear>-or</unclear> a modest
                        nickel was supplied with a fork and a box of sardines, previously opened, it
                        is true, but more than half full. He consumed the sardines utterly, but left
                        the tin box and the fork, after which he indulged in an inexpensive
                        half-pint of lukewarm cider, at one of the open booths. Mug in hand, a
                        gentle glow radiating toward his surface from various centres of activity
                        deep inside him, he paused for breathand the cool, sweet cadences of the
                        water-melon man fell delectably upon his ear:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ice-cole <hi rend="i">water</hi>-melon; ice-cole water-<hi rend="i"
                            >melon;</hi> the biggest slice of <hi rend="i">ice</hi>-cole, ripe, red,
                            <hi rend="i">ice</hi>-cole, rich an&apos; rare; the biggest slice of
                        ice-cole watermelon ever cut by the hand of man! <hi rend="i">Buy</hi> our
                            <hi rend="i">ice</hi>-cole water-melon?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Penrod, having drained the last drop of cider, complied with the watermelon
                        man&apos;s luscious entreaty, and received a round slice of the fruit,
                        magnificent in circumference and something over an inch in thickness.
                        Leaving only the really dangerous part of the rind behind him, he wandered
                        away from the vicinity of the watermelon man and supplied <pb
                            id="VAA2383-206" n="198"/> himself with a bag of peanuts, which, with
                        the expenditure of a dime for admission, left a quarter still warm in his
                        pocket. However, he managed to &quot;break&quot; the coin at a stand
                        inside the tent, where a large, oblong paper box of popcorn was handed him,
                        with twenty cents change. The box was too large to go into his pocket, but,
                        having seated himself among some wistful Polack children, he placed it in
                        his lap and devoured the contents at leisure during the performance. The
                        popcorn was heavily larded with partially boiled molasses, and Penrod
                        sandwiched mouthfuls of peanuts with gobs of this mass until the peanuts
                        were all gone. After that, he ate with less avidity; a sense almost of
                        satiety beginning to manifest itself to him, and it was not until the close
                        of the performance that he disposed of the last morsel.</p>
                    <p>He descended a little heavily to the outflowing crowd in the arena, and
                        bought a caterwauling toy balloon, but showed no great enthusiasm in
                        manipulating it. Near the exit, as he came out, was a hot-waffle stand which
                        he had overlooked, and a sense of duty obliged him to consume the three
                        waffles, thickly powdered with sugar, which the waffle man cooked for him
                        upon command.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-207" n="199"/>
                    <p>They left a hottish taste in his mouth; they had not been quite up to his
                        anticipation, indeed, and it was with a sense of relief that he turned to
                        the &quot;hokey-pokey&quot; cart which stood close at hand, laden
                        with square slabs of &quot;Neapolitan ice-cream&quot; wrapped in
                        paper. He thought the ice-cream would be cooling, but somehow it fell short
                        of the desired effect, and left a peculiar savour in his throat.</p>
                    <p>He walked away, too languid to blow his balloon, and passed a fresh-taffy
                        booth with strange indifference. A bare-armed man was manipulating the taffy
                        over a hook, pulling a great white mass to the desired stage of
                        &quot;candying,&quot; but Penrod did not pause to watch the
                        operation; in fact, he averted his eyes (which were slightly glazed) in
                        passing. He did not analyze his motives: simply, he was conscious that he
                        preferred not to look at the mass of taffy.</p>
                    <p>For some reason, he put a considerable distance between himself and the
                        taffy-stand, but before long halted in the presence of a red-faced man who
                        flourished a long fork over a small cooking apparatus and shouted jovially:
                        &quot;Winnies! <hi rend="i">Here&apos;s</hi> your hot winnies! Hot
                            winny-<hi rend="i">wurst!</hi> Food for the over-worked brain,
                        nourishing for the weak stummick, <pb id="VAA2383-208" n="200"/>
                        entertaining for the tired business man! <hi rend="i">Here&apos;s</hi>
                        your hot winnies, three for a nickel, a half-a-dime, the
                        twentieth-pot-of-a-dollah!&quot;</p>
                    <p>This, above all nectar and ambrosia, was the favourite dish of Penrod
                        Schofield. Nothing inside him now craved iton the contrary! But memory is
                        the great hypnotist; his mind argued against his inwards that opportunity
                        knocked at his door: &quot;winny-wurst&quot; was rigidly forbidden
                        by the home authorities. Besides, there was a last nickel in his pocket; and
                        nature protested against its survival. Also, the red-faced man had himself
                        proclaimed his wares nourishing for the weak stummick.</p>
                    <p>Penrod placed the nickel in the red hand of the red-faced man.</p>
                    <p>He ate two of the three greasy, cigarlike shapes cordially pressed upon him
                        in return. The first bite convinced him that he had made a mistake; these
                        winnies seemed of a very inferior flavour, almost unpleasant, in fact. But
                        he felt obliged to conceal his poor opinion of them, for fear of offending
                        the red-faced man. He ate without haste or eagernessso slowly, indeed, that
                        he began to think the red-faced man might dislike him, as a deterrent of
                        trade. Perhaps Penrod&apos;s mind was not working <pb id="VAA2383-209"

                        <pb id="VAA2383-210" n="202"/> well, for he failed to remember that no law
                        compelled him to remain under the eye of the red-faced man, but the virulent
                        repulsion excited by his attempt to take a bite of the third sausage
                        inspired him with at least an excuse for postponement.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mighty good,&quot; he murmured feebly, placing the sausage in
                        the pocket of his jacket with a shaking hand. &quot;Guess I&apos;ll
                        save this one to eat at home, afterafter dinner.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He moved sluggishly away, wishing he had not thought of dinner. A side-show,
                        undiscovered until now, failed to arouse his interest, not even exciting a
                        wish that he had known of its existence when he had money. For a time he
                        stared without comprehension at a huge canvas poster depicting the chief
                        attraction; the weather-worn colours conveying no meaning to his torpid eye.
                        Then, little by little, the poster became more vivid to his consciousness.
                        There was a greenish-tinted person in the tent, it seemed, who thrived upon
                        a reptilian diet.</p>
                    <p>Suddenly, Penrod decided that it was time to go home.</p>

                        bedroom, &quot;Margaret, where did you put that aromatic ammonia?
                        Where&apos;s Margaret?&quot;</p>
                    <p>But he had to find the aromatic spirits of ammonia <pb id="VAA2383-212"
                            n="204"/> himself, for Margaret was not in the house, She stood in the
                        shadow beneath a maple tree near the street corner, a guitar-case in her
                        hand; and she scanned with anxiety a briskly approaching figure. The are
                        light, swinging above, revealed this figure as that of him she awaited. He
                        was passing toward the gate without seeing her, when she arrested him with a
                        fateful whisper.</p>

                        a little piece of apple and thought it must have some microbes on it. But he
                        got sicker and sicker, and we put him to bedand then we all thought he was

                        and chocolate-creams, and licorice sticks, and lemon-drops, and peanuts, and
                        jaw-breakers, and sardines, and raspberry lemonade, and pickles, and

                        thought he was dying, you see, and he blamed you for the whole thing. He
                        said if you&apos;d only let him alone and not given it to him,

                        the doctor&apos;s still up there. He said it was the acutest case of
                        indigestion he had ever treated in the whole course of his professional
                        practice.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course <hi rend="i">I</hi> didn&apos;t know what
                        he&apos;d do with the dollar,&quot; said Robert.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-215" n="207"/>
                    <p>She did not reply.</p>
                    <p>He began plaintively, &quot;Margaret, you don&apos;t&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve never seen papa and mamma so upset about
                        anything,&quot; she said, rather primly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You mean they&apos;re upset about <hi rend="i"
                        >me</hi>?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We are <hi rend="i">all</hi> very much upset,&quot; returned
                        Margaret, more starch in her tone as she remembered not only
                        Penrod&apos;s sufferings but a duty she had vowed herself to perform.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Margaret! <hi rend="i">You</hi> don&apos;t&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Robert,&quot; she said firmly and, also, with a rhetorical
                        complexity which breeds a suspicion of pre-rehearsal&quot;Robert, for
                        the present I can only look at it in one way: when you gave that money to
                        Penrod you put into the hands of an unthinking little child a weapon which
                        might be, and, indeed was, the means of his undoing. Boys are not
                        respon&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But you saw me give him the dollar, and you
                        didn&apos;t&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Robert!&quot; she checked him with increasing severity.
                        &quot;I am only a woman and not accustomed to thinking everything out on
                        the spur of the moment; but I cannot change my mind. Not now, at
                        least.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-216" n="208"/>
                    <p>&quot;And you think I&apos;d better not come in to-night?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;To-night!&quot; she gasped. &quot;Not for <hi rend="i"
                            >weeks!</hi> Papa would&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But Margaret,&quot; he urged plaintively, &quot;how can you
                        blame me for&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have not used the word &apos;blame,&apos;&quot; she
                        interrupted. &quot;But I must insist that for your carelessness toto
                        wreak such havoccannot fail toto lessen my confidence in your powers of
                        judgment. I cannot change my convictions in this matternot to-nightand I
                        cannot remain here another instant. The poor child may need me. Robert,
                        good-night.&quot;</p>
                    <p>With chill dignity she withdrew, entered the house, and returned to the
                        sick-room, leaving the young man in outer darkness to brood upon his
                        crimeand upon Penrod.</p>
                    <p>That sincere invalid became convalescent upon the third day; and a week
                        elapsed, then, before he found an opportunity to leave the house
                        unaccompaniedsave by Duke. But at last he set forth and approached the Jones
                        neighbourhood in high spirits, pleasantly conscious of his pallor, hollow
                        cheeks, and other perquisites of illness provocative of interest.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-217" n="209"/>
                    <p>One thought troubled him a little because it gave him a sense of inferiority
                        to a rival. He believed, against his will, that Maurice Levy could have
                        successfully eaten chocolate-creams, licorice sticks, lemon-drops,
                        jaw-breakers, peanuts, waffles, lobster croquettes, sardines,
                        cinnamon-drops, watermelon, pickles, popcorn, ice-cream and sausage with
                        raspberry lemonade and cider. Penrod had admitted to himself that Maurice
                        could do it and afterward attend to business, or pleasure, without the
                        slightest discomfort; and this was probably no more than a fair estimate of
                        one of the great constitutions of all time. As a digester, Maurice Levy
                        would have disappointed a Borgia.</p>
                    <p>Fortunately, Maurice was still at Atlantic Cityand now the
                        convalescent&apos;s heart leaped. In the distance he saw Marjorie
                        comingin pink again, with a ravishing little parasol over her head. And
                        alone! No Mitchy-Mitch was to mar this meeting.</p>
                    <p>Penrod increased the feebleness of his steps, now and then leaning upon the
                        fence as if for support.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How do you do, Marjorie?&quot; he said, in his best sick-room
                        voice, as she came near.</p>
                    <p>To his pained amazement, she proceeded on her way, her nose at a celebrated
                        elevationan icy nose.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-218" n="210"/>
                    <p>She cut him dead.</p>
                    <p>He threw his invalid&apos;s airs to the winds, and hastened after her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Marjorie,&quot; he pleaded, &quot;what&apos;s the
                        matter? Are you mad? Honest, that day you said to come back next morning,
                        and you&apos;d be on the corner, I was sick. Honest, I was <hi rend="i"
                            >awful</hi> sick, Marjorie! I had to have the doctor&quot;</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">&quot;Doctor!&quot;</hi> She whirled upon him, her
                        lovely eyes blazing. &quot;I guess <hi rend="i">we&apos;ve</hi> had
                        to have the doctor enough at <hi rend="i">our</hi> house, thanks to <hi
                            rend="i">you,</hi> Mister Penrod Schofield. Papa says you
                        haven&apos;t got <hi rend="i">near</hi> sense enough to come in out of
                        the rain, after what you did to poor little Mitchy-Mitch&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, and he&apos;s sick in bed <hi rend="i">yet!&quot;</hi>
                        Marjorie went on, with unabated fury. &quot;And papa says if he ever
                        catches you in this part of town&quot;</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">&quot;What&apos;d</hi> I do to Mitchy-Mitch?&quot;
                        gasped Penrod.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You know well enough what you did to Mitchy-Mitch!&quot; she
                        cried. &quot;You gave him that great, big, nasty two-cent
                        piece!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, what of it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mitchy-Mitch swallowed it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What!&quot;</p>

                    <p>&quot;And papa says if he ever just lays eyes on you, once, in this
                        neighbourhood&quot;</p>
                    <p>But Penrod had started for home.</p>
                    <p>In his embittered heart there was increasing a critical disapproval of the
                        Creator&apos;s methods. When He made pretty girls, thought Penrod, why
                        couldn&apos;t He have left out their little brothers!</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="b">F</hi>OR several days after this, Penrod thought of growing up
                        to be a monk, and engaged in good works so far as to carry some kittens
                        (that otherwise would have been drowned) and a pair of Margaret&apos;s
                        outworn dancing-slippers to a poor, ungrateful old man sojourning in a shed
                        up the alley. And although Mr. Robert Williams, after a very short interval,
                        began to leave his guitar on the front porch again, exactly as if he thought
                        nothing had happened, Penrod, with his younger vision of a father&apos;s
                        mood, remained coldly distant from the <pb id="VAA2383-221" n="213"/> Jones
                        neighbourhood. With his own family his manner was gentle, proud and sad, but
                        not for long enough to frighten them. The change came with mystifying
                        abruptness at the end of the week.</p>
                    <p>It was Duke who brought it about.</p>
                    <p>Duke could chase a much bigger dog out of the Schofields&apos; yard and
                        far down the street. This might be thought to indicate unusual valour on the
                        part of Duke and cowardice on that of the bigger dogs whom he undoubtedly
                        put to rout. On the contrary, all such flights were founded in mere
                        superstition, for dogs are even more superstitious than boys and coloured
                        people; and the most firmly established of all dog superstitions is that any
                        dogbe he the smallest and feeblest in the worldcan whip any trespasser
                        whatsoever.</p>
                    <p>A rat-terrier believes that on his home grounds he can whip an elephant. It
                        follows, of course, that a big dog, away from his own home, will run from a
                        little dog in the little dog&apos;s neighbourhood. Otherwise, the big
                        dog must face a charge of inconsistency, and dogs are as consistent as they
                        are superstitious. A dog believes in war, but he is convinced that there are
                        times when it is moral to run; and the thoughtful physiognomist, seeing a
                        big dog fleeing out of a <pb id="VAA2383-222" n="214"/> little
                        dog&apos;s yard, must observe that the expression of the big
                        dog&apos;s face is more conscientious than alarmed: it is the expression
                        of a person performing a duty to himself.</p>
                    <p>Penrod understood these matters perfectly; he knew that the gaunt brown hound
                        Duke chased up the alley had fled only out of deference to a custom, yet
                        Penrod could not refrain from bragging of Duke to the hound&apos;s
                        owner, a fat-faced stranger of twelve or thirteen, who had wandered into the
                        neighbourhood.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You better keep that ole yellow dog o&apos; yours
                        back,&quot; said Penrod ominously, as he climbed the fence.
                        &quot;You better catch him and hold him till I get mine inside the yard
                        again. Duke&apos;s chewed up some pretty bad bulldogs around
                        here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The fat-faced boy gave Penrod a fishy stare. &quot;You&apos;d oughta
                        learn him not to do that,&quot; he said &quot;It&apos;ll make
                        him sick.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What will?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The stranger laughed raspingly and gazed up the alley, where the hound,
                        having come to a halt, now coolly sat down, and, with an expression of
                        roguish benevolence, patronizingly watched the tempered fury of Duke, whose
                        assaults and barkings were becoming perfunctory.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-223" n="215"/>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;ll make Duke sick?&quot; Penrod demanded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Eatin&apos; dead bulldogs people leave around here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>This was not improvisation but formula, adapted from other occasions to the
                        present encounter; nevertheless, it was new to Penrod, and he was so taken
                        with it that resentment lost itself in admiration. Hastily committing the
                        gem to memory for use upon a dog-owning friend, he inquired in a sociable
                        tone:</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s your dog&apos;s name?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Dan. You better call your ole pup, &apos;cause Dan eats <hi
                            rend="i">live</hi> dogs.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Dan&apos;s actions poorly supported his master&apos;s assertion, for,
                        upon Duke&apos;s ceasing to bark, Dan rose and showed the most courteous
                        interest in making the little, old dog&apos;s acquaintance. Dan had a
                        great deal of manner, and it became plain that Duke was impressed favourably
                        in spite of former prejudice, so that presently the two trotted amicably
                        back to their masters and sat down with the harmonious but indifferent air
                        of having known each other intimately for years.</p>
                    <p>They were received without comment, though both boys looked at them
                        reflectively for a time. It was Penrod who spoke first.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What number you go to?&quot; (In an &quot;oral lesson in
                        English,&quot; Penrod had been instructed to put this <pb
                            id="VAA2383-224" n="216"/> question in another form: &quot;May I ask
                        which of our public schools you attend?&quot;)</p>
                    <p>&quot;Me? What number do I go to?&quot; said the stranger,
                        contemptuously. &quot;I don&apos;t go to <hi rend="i">no</hi> number
                        in vacation!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I mean when it ain&apos;t.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Third,&quot; returned the fat-faced boy. &quot;I got
                        &apos;em <hi rend="i">all</hi> scared in <hi rend="i">that</hi>
                        school.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What of?&quot; innocently asked Penrod, to whom &quot;the
                        Third&quot;in a distant part of townwas undiscovered country.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What of? I guess you&apos;d soon see what of, if you ever was
                        in that school about one day. You&apos;d be lucky if you got out
                        alive!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are the teachers mean?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The other boy frowned with bitter scorn. &quot;Teachers! Teachers
                        don&apos;t order <hi rend="i">me</hi> around, I can tell you!
                        They&apos;re mighty careful how they try to run over Rupe
                        Collins.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who&apos;s Rupe Collins?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who is he?&quot; echoed the fat-faced boy incredulously.
                        &quot;Say, ain&apos;t you got <hi rend="i">any</hi> sense?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Say, wouldn&apos;t you be just as happy if you had <hi rend="i"
                            >some</hi> sense?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-225" n="217"/>
                    <p>&quot;Ye-es.&quot; Penrod&apos;s answer, like the look he lifted
                        to the impressive stranger, was meek and placative. &quot;Rupe Collins
                        is the principal at your school, I guess.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The other yelled with jeering laughter, and mocked Penrod&apos;s manner
                        and voice. &quot;&apos;Rupe Collins is the principal at your school,
                        I guess!&apos;&quot; He laughed harshly again, then suddenly showed
                        truculence. &quot;Say, &apos;bo, whyn&apos;t you learn enough to
                        go in the house when it rains? What&apos;s the matter of you,
                        anyhow?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; urged Penrod timidly, &quot;nobody ever <hi
                            rend="i">told</hi> me who Rupe Collins is: I got a <hi rend="i"
                        >right</hi> to think he&apos;s the principal, haven&apos;t
                        I?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The fat-faced boy shook his head disgustedly. &quot;Honest, you make me
                        sick!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Penrod&apos;s expression became one of despair. &quot;Well, who <hi
                            rend="i">is</hi> he?&quot; he cried.</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;Who <hi rend="i">is</hi> he?&apos;&quot; mocked
                        the other, with a scorn that withered. &quot;&apos;Who <hi rend="i"
                            >is</hi> he?&apos; ME!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh!&quot; Penrod was humiliated but relieved: he felt that he
                        had proved himself criminally ignorant, yet a peril seemed to have passed.
                        &quot;Rupe Collins is <hi rend="i">your</hi> name, then, I guess. I kind
                        of thought it was, all the time.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-226" n="218"/>
                    <p>The fat-faced boy still appeared embittered, burlesquing this speech in a
                        hateful falsetto. &quot;&apos;Rupe Collins is <hi rend="i">your</hi>
                        name, then, I guess!&apos; Oh, you &apos;kind of thought it was, all
                        the time,&apos; did you?&quot; Suddenly concentrating his brow into
                        a histrionic scowl he thrust his face within an inch of Penrod&apos;s.
                        &quot;Yes, sonny, Rupe Collins is my name, and you better look out what
                        you say when he&apos;s around or you&apos;ll get in big trouble! <hi
                            rend="i">You understan&apos; that, &apos;bo?&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Penrod was cowed but fascinated: he felt that there was something dangerous
                        and dashing about this newcomer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he said, feebly, drawing back. &quot;My
                        name&apos;s Penrod Schofield.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then I reckon your father and mother ain&apos;t got good
                        sense,&quot; said Mr. Collins promptly, this also being formula.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;Cause if they had they&apos;d of give you a good
                        name!&quot; And the agreeable youth instantly rewarded himself for the
                        wit with another yell of rasping laughter, after which he pointed suddenly
                        at Penrod&apos;s right hand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where&apos;d you get that wart on your finger?&quot; he
                        demanded severely.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-227" n="219"/>

                                better look out what you say when he&apos;s
                            around!&quot;</hi>

                    <pb id="VAA2383-228" n="220"/>
                    <p>&quot;Which finger?&quot; asked the mystified Penrod, extending his
                        hand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The middle one.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;There!&quot; exclaimed Rupe Collins, seizing and vigorously
                        twisting the wartless finger navely offered for his inspection.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Quit!&quot; shouted Penrod in agony. <hi rend="i"
                            >&quot;Quee</hi>-yut!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Say your prayers!&quot; commanded Rupe, and continued to twist
                        the luckless finger until Penrod writhed to his knees.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">&quot;Ow!&quot;</hi> The victim, released, looked
                        grievously upon the still painful finger.</p>
                    <p>At this Rupe&apos;s scornful expression altered to one of contrition.
                        &quot;Well, I declare!&quot; he exclaimed remorsefully. &quot;I
                        didn&apos;t s&apos;pose it would hurt. Turn about&apos;s fair
                        play; so now you do that to me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He extended the middle finger of his left hand and Penrod promptly seized it,
                        but did not twist it, for he was instantly swung round with his back to his
                        amiable new acquaintance: Rupe&apos;s right hand operated upon the back
                        of Penrod&apos;s slender neck; Rupe&apos;s knee tortured the small
                        of Penrod&apos;s back.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">&quot;Ow!</hi> Penrod bent far forward involuntarily and
                        went to his knees again.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-229" n="221"/>
                    <p>&quot;Lick dirt,&quot; commanded Rupe, forcing the captive&apos;s
                        face to the sidewalk; and the suffering Penrod completed this ceremony.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Collins evinced satisfaction by means of his horse laugh.
                        &quot;You&apos;d last jest about one day up at the Third!&quot;
                        he said. &quot;You&apos;d come runnin&apos; home,
                        yellin&apos; <hi rend="i">&apos;Mom-muh, mom</hi>-muh,&apos;
                        before recess was over!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, I wouldn&apos;t,&quot; Penrod protested rather weakly,
                        dusting his knees.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You would, too!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, I w&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Looky here,&quot; said the fat-faced boy, darkly,
                        &quot;what you mean, counterdicking me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He advanced a step and Penrod hastily qualified his contradiction.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I mean, I don&apos;t <hi rend="i">think</hi> I would.
                        I&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You better look out!&quot; Rupe moved closer, and unexpectedly
                        grasped the back of Penrod&apos;s neck again. &quot;Say, &apos;I
                            <hi rend="i">would</hi> run home yellin&apos; <hi rend="i"
                            >&quot;Mom</hi>-muh!&quot;&apos;&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ow! I <hi rend="i">would</hi> run home yellin&apos;
                        &apos;Mom-muh.&apos;&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;There!&quot; said Rupe, giving the helpless nape a final
                        squeeze. &quot;That&apos;s the way we do up at the Third.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-230" n="222"/>
                    <p>Penrod rubbed his neck and asked meekly:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Can you do that to any boy up at the Third?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;See here now,&quot; said Rupe, in the tone of one goaded beyond
                        all endurance, <hi rend="i">&quot;you</hi> say if I can! You better say
                        it quick, or&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I knew you could,&quot; Penrod interposed hastily, with the
                        pathetic semblance of a laugh. &quot;I only said that in fun.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;In &apos;fun&apos;!&quot; repeated Rupe stormily.
                        &quot;You better look out how you&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I <hi rend="i">said</hi> I wasn&apos;t in
                        earnest!&quot; Penrod retreated a few steps. <hi rend="i"
                        >&quot;I</hi> knew you could, all the time. I expect <hi rend="i">I</hi>
                        could do it to some of the boys up at the Third, myself. Couldn&apos;t
                        I?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, you couldn&apos;t.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, there must be <hi rend="i">some</hi> boy up there that I
                        could&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, they ain&apos;t! You better&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I expect not, then,&quot; said Penrod, quickly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You <hi rend="i">better</hi> &apos;expect not.&apos;
                        Didn&apos;t I tell you once you&apos;d never get back alive if you
                        ever tried to come up around the Third? You want me to <hi rend="i"
                        >show</hi> you how we do up there, &apos;bo?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He began a slow and deadly advance, whereupon Penrod timidly offered a
                        diversion:</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-231" n="223"/>
                    <p>&quot;Say, Rupe, I got a box of rats in our stable under a glass cover,
                        so you can watch &apos;em jump around when you hammer on the box. Come
                        on and look at &apos;em.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right,&quot; said the fat-faced boy, slightly mollified.
                        &quot;We&apos;ll let Dan kill &apos;em.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, <hi rend="i">sir!</hi> I&apos;m goin&apos; to keep
                        &apos;em. They&apos;re kind of pets; I&apos;ve had &apos;em
                        all summerI got names for &apos;em, and&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Looky here, &apos;bo. Did you hear me say we&apos;ll let
                        Dan kill &apos;em?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, but I won&apos;t&quot;</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">&quot;What</hi> won&apos;t you?&quot; Rupe became
                        sinister immediately. &quot;It seems to me you&apos;re
                        gettin&apos; pretty fresh around here.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I don&apos;t want&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mr. Collins once more brought into play the dreadful eye-to-eye scowl as
                        practised &quot;up at the Third,&quot; and, sometimes, also by young
                        leading men upon the stage. Frowning appallingly, and thrusting forward his
                        underlip, he placed his nose almost in contact with the nose of Penrod,
                        whose eyes naturally became crossed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Dan kills the rats. See?&quot; hissed the fat-faced boy,
                        maintaining the horrible juxtaposition.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-232" n="224"/>
                    <p>&quot;Well, all right,&quot; said Penrod, swallowing. <hi rend="i"
                            >&quot;I</hi> don&apos;t want &apos;em much.&quot; And
                        when the pose had been relaxed, he stared at his new friend for a moment,
                        almost with reverence. Then he brightened.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come on, Rupe!&quot; he cried enthusiastically, as he climbed
                        the fence. &quot;We&apos;ll give our dogs a little live
                        meat&apos;bo!&quot;</p>

                        <hi rend="b">A</hi>T THE dinner-table, that evening, Penrod surprised his
                        family by remarking, in a voice they had never heard him attempta law-giving
                        voice of intentional gruffness:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Any man that&apos;s makin&apos; a hunderd dollars a month
                        is makin&apos; good money.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What?&quot; asked Mr. Schofield, staring, for the previous
                        conversation had concerned the illness of an infant relative in Council
                        Bluffs.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Any man that&apos;s makin&apos; a hunderd dollars a month
                        is makin&apos; good money.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-234" n="226"/>
                    <p>&quot;What <hi rend="i">is</hi> he talking about!&quot; Margaret
                        appealed to the invisible.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Penrod, frowning, &quot;that&apos;s
                        what foremen at the ladder works get.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How in the world do you know?&quot; asked his mother.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I <hi rend="i">know</hi> it! A hunderd dollars a month is
                        good money, I tell you!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, what of it?&quot; said the father, impatiently.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nothin&apos;. I only said it was good money.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mr. Schofield shook his head, dismissing the subject; and here he made a
                        mistake: he should have followed up his son&apos;s singular contribution
                        to the conversation. That would have revealed the fact that there was a
                        certain Rupe Collins whose father was a foreman at the ladder works. All
                        clues are important when a boy makes his first remark in a new key.</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;Good money&apos;?&quot; repeated Margaret,
                        curiously, &quot;What is &apos;good&apos; money?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Penrod turned upon her a stern glance. &quot;Say, wouldn&apos;t you
                        be just as happy if you had <hi rend="i">some</hi> sense?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Penrod!&quot; shouted his father. But Penrod&apos;s mother
                        gazed with dismay at her son: he had never before spoken like that to his
                        sister.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-235" n="227"/>
                    <p>Mrs. Schofield might have been more dismayed than she was, if she had
                        realized that it was the beginning of an epoch. After dinner, Penrod was
                        slightly scalded in the back as the result of telling Della, the cook, that
                        there was a wart on the middle finger of her right hand. Della thus proving
                        poor material for his new manner to work upon, he approached Duke, in the
                        backyard, and, bending double, seized the lowly animal by the forepaws.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I let you know my name&apos;s Penrod Schofield,&quot;
                        hissed the boy. He protruded his underlip ferociously, scowled, and thrust
                        forward his head until his nose touched the dog&apos;s. &quot;And
                        you better look out when Penrod Schofield&apos;s around, or
                        you&apos;ll get in big trouble! <hi rend="i">You understan&apos;
                            that, &apos;bo?&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The next day, and the next, the increasing change in Penrod puzzled and
                        distressed his family, who had no idea of its source. How might they guess
                        that hero-worship takes such forms? They were vaguely conscious that a
                        rather shabby boy, not of the neighbourhood, came to
                        &quot;play&quot; with Penrod several times; but they failed to
                        connect this circumstance with the peculiar behaviour of the son of the
                        house, whose ideals (his father remarked) seemed to have suddenly become
                        identical with those of Gyp the Blood.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-236" n="228"/>
                    <p>Meanwhile, for Penrod himself, &quot;life had taken on new meaning, new
                        richness.&quot; He had become a fighting manin conversation at least.
                        &quot;Do you want to know how I do when they try to slip up on me from
                        behind?&quot; he asked Della. And he enacted for her unappreciative eye
                        a scene of fistic manoeuvres wherein he held an imaginary antagonist
                        helpless in a net of stratagems.</p>
                    <p>Frequently, when he was alone, he would outwit and pummel this same enemy,
                        and, after a cunning feint, land a dolorous stroke full upon a face of air.
                        &quot;There! I guess you&apos;ll know better next time.
                        That&apos;s the way we do up at the Third!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Sometimes, in solitary pantomime, he encountered more than one opponent at a
                        time, for numbers were apt to come upon him treacherously, especially at a
                        little after his rising hour, when he might be caught at a
                        disadvantageperhaps standing on one leg to encase the other in his
                        knickerbockers. Like lightning, he would hurl the trapping garment from him,
                        and, ducking and pivoting, deal great sweeping blows among the circle of
                        sneaking devils. (That was how he broke the clock in his bedroom.) And while
                        these battles were occupying his attention, it was a waste of voice to call
                        him to breakfast, though <pb id="VAA2383-237" n="229"/> if his mother,
                        losing patience, came to his room, she would find him seated on the bed
                        pulling at a stocking. &quot;Well, ain&apos;t I coming fast as I <hi
                            rend="i">can?&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>At the table and about the house generally he was bumptious, loud with
                        fatuous misinformation, and assumed a domineering tone, which neither satire
                        nor reproof seemed able to reduce; but it was among his own intimates that
                        his new superiority was most outrageous. He twisted the fingers and squeezed
                        the necks of all the boys of the neighbourhood, meeting their indignation
                        with a hoarse and rasping laugh he had acquired after short practice in the
                        stable, where he jeered and taunted the lawnmower, the garden-scythe and the
                        wheelbarrow quite out of countenance.</p>
                    <p>Likewise he bragged to the other boys by the hour, Rupe Collins being the
                        chief subject of encomiumnext to Penrod himself. &quot;That&apos;s
                        the way we do up at the Third,&quot; became staple explanation of
                        violence, for Penrod, like Tartarin, was plastic in the hands of his own
                        imagination, and at times convinced himself that he really was one of those
                        dark and murderous spirits exclusively of whom &quot;the Third&quot;
                        was composedaccording to Rupe Collins.</p>
                    <p>Then, when Penrod had exhausted himself repeating <pb id="VAA2383-238"
                            n="230"/> to nausea accounts of the prowess of himself and his great
                        friend, he would turn to two other subjects for vainglory. These were his
                        father and Duke.</p>
                    <p>Mothers must accept the fact that between babyhood and manhood their sons do
                        not boast of them. The boy, with boys, is a Choctaw; and either the
                        influence or the protection of women is shameful. &quot;Your mother
                        won&apos;t let you,&quot; is an insult. But, &quot;My father
                        won&apos;t let me,&quot; is a dignified explanation and cannot be
                        hooted. A boy is ruined among his fellows if he talks much of his mother or
                        sisters; and he must recognize it as his duty to offer at least the
                        appearance of persecution to all things ranked as female, such as cats and
                        every species of fowl. But he must champion his father and his dog, and,
                        ever ready to pit either against any challenger, must picture both as
                        ravening for battle and absolutely unconquerable.</p>
                    <p>Penrod, of course, had always talked by the code, but, under the new
                        stimulus, Duke was represented virtually as a cross between Bob, Son of
                        Battle, and a South American vampire; and this in spite of the fact that
                        Duke himself often sat close by, a living lie, with the hope of peace in his
                        heart. As for <pb id="VAA2383-239" n="231"/> Penrod&apos;s father, that
                        gladiator was painted as of sentiments and dimensions suitable to a
                        super-demon composed of equal parts of Goliath, Jack Johnson and the Emperor
                        Nero.</p>
                    <p>Even Penrod&apos;s walk was affected; he adopted a gait which was a kind
                        of taunting swagger; and, when he passed other children on the street, he
                        practised the habit of feinting a blow; then, as the victim dodged, he
                        rasped the triumphant horse laugh which he gradually mastered to horrible
                        perfection. He did this to Marjorie Jonesay! this was their next meeting,
                        and such is Eros, young! What was even worse, in Marjorie&apos;s
                        opinion, he went on his way without explanation, and left her standing on
                        the corner talking about it, long after he was out of hearing.</p>
                    <p>Within five days from his first encounter with Rupe Collins, Penrod had
                        become unbearable. He even almost alienated Sam Williams, who for a time
                        submitted to finger twisting and neck squeezing and the new style of
                        conversation, but finally declared that Penrod made him
                        &quot;sick.&quot; He made the statement with fervour, one sultry
                        afternoon, in Mr. Schofield&apos;s stable, in the presence of Herman and
                        Verman.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You better look out, &apos;bo,&quot; said Penrod,
                        threateningly. <pb id="VAA2383-240" n="232"/> &quot;I&apos;ll show
                        you a little how we do up at the Third.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Up at the Third!&quot; Sam repeated with scorn. &quot;You
                        haven&apos;t ever been up there.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I haven&apos;t?&quot; cried Penrod. &quot;I <hi
                            rend="i">haven&apos;t?&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>&quot;No, you haven&apos;t!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Looky here!&quot; Penrod, darkly argumentative, prepared to
                        perform the eye-to-eye business. &quot;When haven&apos;t I been up
                        there?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You haven&apos;t <hi rend="i">never</hi> been up
                        there!&quot; In spite of Penrod&apos;s closely approaching nose Sam
                        maintained his ground, and appealed for confirmation. &quot;Has he,
                        Herman?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos; reckon so,&quot; said Herman, laughing.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">&quot;What!&quot;</hi> Penrod transferred his nose to
                        the immediate vicinity of Herman&apos;s nose. &quot;You
                        don&apos;t reckon so, &apos;bo, don&apos;t you? You better look
                        out how you reckon around here! <hi rend="i">You understan&apos; that,
                            &apos;bo?&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Herman bore the eye-to-eye very well; indeed, it seemed to please him, for he
                        continued to laugh while Verman chuckled delightedly. The brothers had been
                        in the country picking berries for a week, and it happened that this was
                        their first experience of the new manifestation of Penrod.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-241" n="233"/>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">&quot;Haven&apos;t</hi> I been up at the
                        Third?&quot; the sinister Penrod demanded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos; reckon so. How come you ast <hi rend="i"
                            >me?&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>&quot;Didn&apos;t you just hear me <hi rend="i">say</hi> I been up
                        there?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Herman mischievously,
                        &quot;hearin&apos; ain&apos;t believin&apos;!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Penrod clutched him by the back of the neck, but Herman, laughing loudly,
                        ducked and released himself at once, retreating to the wall.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You take that back!&quot; Penrod shouted, striking out wildly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos; git mad,&quot; begged the small darky, while a
                        number of blows falling upon his warding arms failed to abate his amusement,
                        and a sound one upon the cheek only made him laugh the more unrestrainedly.
                        He behaved exactly as if Penrod were tickling him, and his brother, Verman,
                        rolled with joy in a wheelbarrow. Penrod pummelled till he was tired, and
                        produced no greater effect.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There!&quot; he panted, desisting finally. <hi rend="i"
                            >&quot;Now</hi> I reckon you know whether I been up there or
                        not!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Herman rubbed his smitten cheek. &quot;Pow!&quot; he exclaimed.
                        &quot;Pow-ee! You cert&apos;ny did lan&apos; me good one <hi
                            rend="i">nat</hi> time! Oo-ee! she <hi rend="i">hurt!&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ll get hurt worse&apos;n that,&quot; Penrod
                        assured <pb id="VAA2383-242" n="234"/> him, &quot;if you stay around
                        here much. Rupe Collins is comin&apos; this afternoon, he said.
                        We&apos;re goin&apos; to make some policemen&apos;s billies out
                        of the rake handle.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You go&apos; spoil new rake you&apos; pa bought?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What do <hi rend="i">we</hi> care? I and Rupe got to have billies,
                        haven&apos;t we?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How you make &apos;em?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Melt lead and pour in a hole we&apos;re goin&apos; to make
                        in the end of &apos;em. Then we&apos;re goin&apos; to carry
                        &apos;em in our pockets, and if anybody says anything to us<hi rend="i"
                            >oh,</hi> oh! look out! They won&apos;t get a crack on the head<hi
                            rend="i">oh,</hi> no!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;When&apos;s Rupe Collins coming?&quot; Sam Williams
                        inquired rather uneasily. He had heard a great deal too much of this
                        personage, but as yet the pleasure of actual acquaintance had been denied
                        him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;s liable to be here any time,&quot; answered
                        Pen-rod. &quot;You better look out. You&apos;ll be lucky if you get
                        home alive, if you stay till <hi rend="i">he</hi> comes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I ain&apos;t afraid of him,&quot; Sam returned,
                        conventionally.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are, too!&quot; (There was some truth in the retort.)
                        &quot;There ain&apos;t any boy in this part of tow but me that
                        wouldn&apos;t be afraid of him. You&apos;d be <pb id="VAA2383-243"
                            n="235"/> afraid to talk to him. You wouldn&apos;t get a word out of
                        your mouth before old Rupie&apos;d have you where you&apos;d wished
                        you never come around <hi rend="i">him,</hi> lettin&apos; on like you
                        was so much! <hi rend="i">You</hi> wouldn&apos;t run home
                        yellin&apos; &apos;Mom-muh&apos; or nothin&apos;! <hi
                            rend="i">Oh,</hi> no!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who Rupe Collins?&quot; asked Herman.</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;Who Rupe Collins?&apos;&quot; Penrod mocked, and
                        used his rasping laugh, but, instead of showing fright, Herman appeared to
                        think he was meant to laugh, too; and so he did, echoed by Verman.
                        &quot;You just hang around here a little while longer,&quot; Penrod
                        added, grimly, &quot;and you&apos;ll find out who Rupe Collins is,
                        and I pity <hi rend="i">you</hi> when you do!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What he go&apos; do?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ll see; that&apos;s all! You just wait
                        and&quot;</p>
                    <p>At this moment a brown hound ran into the stable through the alley door,
                        wagged a greeting to Pen-rod, and fraternized with Duke. The fat-faced boy
                        appeared upon the threshold and gazed coldly about the little company in the
                        carriage-house, whereupon the coloured brethren, ceasing from merriment,
                        were instantly impassive, and Sam Williams moved a little nearer the door
                        leading into the yard.</p>
                    <p>Obviously, Sam regarded the newcomer as a redoubtable if not ominous figure.
                        He was a head <pb id="VAA2383-244" n="236"/> taller than either Sam or
                        Penrod; head and shoulders taller than Herman, who was short for his age;
                        and Verman could hardly be used for purposes of comparison at all, being a
                        mere squat brown spot, not yet quite nine years on this planet. And to
                        Sam&apos;s mind, the aspect of Mr. Collins realized Penrod&apos;s
                        portentous foreshadowings. Upon the fat face there was an expression of
                        truculent intolerance which had been cultivated by careful habit to such
                        perfection that Sam&apos;s heart sank at sight of it. A somewhat
                        enfeebled twin to this expression had of late often decorated the visage of
                        Penrod, and appeared upon that ingenuous surface now, as he advanced to
                        welcome the eminent visitor.</p>
                    <p>The host swaggered toward the door with a great deal of shoulder movement,
                        carelessly feinting a slap at Verman in passing, and creating by various
                        means the atmosphere of a man who has contemptuously amused himself with
                        underlings while awaiting an equal.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hello, &apos;bo!&quot; Penrod said in the deepest voice
                        possible to him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who you callin&apos; &apos;bo?&quot; was the ungracious
                        response, accompanied by immediate action of a similar nature. Rupe held
                        Penrod&apos;s head in the crook <pb id="VAA2383-245" n="237"/> of an
                        elbow and massaged his temples with a hard-pressing knuckle.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I was only in fun, Rupie,&quot; pleaded the sufferer, and then,
                        being set free, &quot;Come here, Sam,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What for?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Penrod laughed pityingly. &quot;Pshaw, I ain&apos;t goin&apos; to
                        hurt you. Come on.&quot; Sam, maintaining his position near the other
                        door, Penrod went to him and caught him round the neck.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Watch me, Rupie!&quot; Penrod called, and performed upon Sam
                        the knuckle operation which he had himself just undergone, Sam submitting
                        mechanically, his eyes fixed with increasing uneasiness upon Rupe Collins.
                        Sam had a premonition that something even more painful than
                        Penrod&apos;s knuckle was going to be inflicted upon him.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">&quot;That</hi> don&apos; hurt,&quot; said Penrod,
                        pushing him away.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, it does, too!&quot; Sam rubbed his temple.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Puh! It didn&apos;t hurt me, did it, Rupie? Come on in, Rupe:
                        show this baby where he&apos;s got a wart on his finger.&quot;</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">&quot;You</hi> showed me that trick,&quot; Sam
                        objected. &quot;You already did that to me. You tried it twice this
                        afternoon and I don&apos;t know how many times before, only you
                        weren&apos;t strong enough after the <pb id="VAA2383-246" n="238"/>
                        first time. Anyway, I know what it is, and I don&apos;t&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come on, Rupe,&quot; said Penrod. &quot;Make the baby lick
                        dirt.&quot;</p>
                    <p>At this bidding, Rupe approached, while Sam, still protesting, moved to the
                        threshold of the outer door; but Penrod seized him by the shoulders and
                        swung him indoors with a shout.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Little baby wants to run home to its Mom-muh! Here he is,
                        Rupie.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Thereupon was Penrod&apos;s treachery to an old comrade properly
                        rewarded, for as the two struggled. Rupe caught each by the back of the
                        neck, simultaneously, and, with creditable impartiality, forced both boys to
                        their knees.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Lick dirt!&quot; he commanded, forcing them still forward,
                        until their faces were close to the stable floor.</p>
                    <p>At this moment he received a real surprise. With a loud whack something
                        struck the back of his head, and, turning, he beheld Verman in the act of
                        lifting a piece of lath to strike again.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Em moys ome!&quot; said Verman, the Giant Killer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He tongue-tie&apos;,&quot; Herman explained. &quot;He
                        say, let &apos;em boys alone.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-247" n="239"/>
                    <p>Rupe addressed his host briefly:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Chase them nigs out o&apos; here!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos; call me nig,&quot; said Herman. &quot;I mine
                        my own biznuss. You let &apos;em boys alone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Rupe strode across the still prostrate Sam, stepped upon Penrod, and,
                        equipping his countenance with the terrifying scowl and protruded jaw,
                        lowered his head to the level of Herman&apos;s.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nig, you&apos;ll be lucky if you leave here alive!&quot;
                        And he leaned forward till his nose was within less than an inch of
                        Herman&apos;s nose.</p>
                    <p>It could be felt that something awful was about to happen, and Penrod, as he
                        rose from the floor, suffered an unexpected twinge of apprehension and
                        remorse: he hoped that Rupe wouldn&apos;t <hi rend="i">really</hi> hurt
                        Herman. A sudden dislike of Rupe and Rupe&apos;s ways rose within him,
                        as he looked at the big boy overwhelming the little darky with that
                        ferocious scowl. Penrod, all at once, felt sorry about something
                        indefinable; and, with equal vagueness, he felt foolish. &quot;Come on,
                        Rupe,&quot; he suggested, feebly, &quot;let Herman go, and
                        let&apos;s us make our billies out of the rake handle.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The rake handle, however, was not available, if Rupe had inclined to favour
                        the suggestion. Verman <pb id="VAA2383-248" n="240"/> had discarded his lath
                        for the rake, which he was at this moment lifting in the air.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You ole black nigger,&quot; the fat-faced boy said venomously
                        to Herman, &quot;I&apos;m agoin&apos; to&quot;</p>
                    <p>But he had allowed his nose to remain too long near Herman&apos;s.
                        Penrod&apos;s familiar nose had been as close with only a ticklish
                        spinal effect upon the not very remote descendant of Congo man-eaters. The
                        result produced by the glare of Rupe&apos;s unfamiliar eyes, and by the
                        dreadfully suggestive proximity of Rupe&apos;s unfamiliar nose, was
                        altogether different. Herman&apos;s and Verman&apos;s Bangala
                        great-grandfathers never considered people of their own jungle neighbourhood
                        proper material for a meal, but they looked upon strangersespecially
                        truculent strangersas distinctly edible.</p>
                    <p>Penrod and Sam heard Rupe suddenly squawk and bellow; saw him writhe and
                        twist and fling out his arms like flails, though without removing his face
                        from its juxtaposition; indeed, for a moment, the two heads seemed even
                        closer.</p>
                    <p>Then they separatedand battle was on!</p>

                        the tale to tell of a &quot;good rousing fight&quot; between boys or
                        men who fight in the &quot;good old English way,&quot; according to
                        a model set for fights in books long before Tom Brown went to Rugby. There
                        are seconds and rounds and rules of fair-play, and always there is great
                        good feeling in the endthough sometimes, to vary the model, &quot;the

                        old pattern on his page is certain of applause as the stirrer of
                        &quot;red blood.&quot; There is no surer recipe.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-250" n="242"/>
                    <p>But when Herman and Verman set to <unclear/> the record must be no more than
                        a few fragments left by the expurgator. It has been perhaps sufficiently
                        suggested that the altercation in Mr. Schofield&apos;s stable opened
                        with mayhem in respect to the aggressor&apos;s nose. Expressing vocally
                        his indignation and the extremity of his pained surprise, Mr. Collins
                        stepped backward, holding his left hand over his nose, and striking at
                        Herman with his right. Then Verman hit him with the rake.</p>
                    <p>Verman struck from behind. He struck as hard as he could. And he struck with
                        the tines down. For, in his simple, direct African way he wished to kill his
                        enemy, and he wished to kill him as soon as possible. That was his single,
                        earnest purpose.</p>
                    <p>On this account, Rupe Collins was peculiarly unfortunate. He was plucky and
                        he enjoyed conflict, but neither his ambitions nor his anticipations had
                        ever included murder. He had not learned that an habitually aggressive
                        person runs the danger of colliding with beings in one of those lower stages
                        of evolution wherein theories about &quot;hitting below the
                        belt&quot; have not yet made their appearance.</p>
                    <p>The rake glanced from the back of Rupe&apos;s head to <pb
                            id="VAA2383-251" n="243"/> his shoulder, but it felled him. Both darkies
                        jumped full upon him instantly, and the three rolled and twisted upon the
                        stable floor, unloosing upon the air sincere maledictions closely connected
                        with complaints of cruel and unusual treatment; while certain expressions of
                        feeling presently emanating from Herman and Verman indicated that Rupe
                        Collins, in this extremity, was proving himself not too slavishly addicted
                        to fighting by rule. Dan and Duke, mistaking all for mirth, barked gayly.</p>
                    <p>From the panting, pounding, yelling heap issued words and phrases hitherto
                        quite unknown to Penrod and Sam; also, a hoarse repetition in the voice of
                        Rupe concerning his ear left it not to be doubted that additional mayhem was
                        taking place. Appalled, the two spectators retreated to the doorway nearest
                        the yard, where they stood dumbly watching the cataclysm.</p>
                    <p>The struggle increased in primitive simplicity: time and again the howling
                        Rupe got to his knees only to go down again as the earnest brothers, in
                        their own way, assisted him to a more reclining position. Primal forces
                        operated here, and the two blanched, slightly higher products of evolution,
                        Sam and Penrod, no more thought of interfering <pb id="VAA2383-252" n="244"
                        /> than they would have thought of interfering with an earthquake.</p>
                    <p>At last, out of the ruck rose Verman, disfigured and maniacal. With a wild
                        eye he looked about him for his trusty rake; but Penrod, in horror, had long
                        since thrown the rake out into the yard. Naturally, it had not seemed
                        necessary to remove the lawn-mower.</p>
                    <p>The frantic eye of Verman fell upon the lawn-mower, and instantly he leaped
                        to its handle. Shrilling a wordless war-cry, he charged, propelling the
                        whirling, deafening knives straight upon the prone legs of Rupe Collins. The
                        lawn-mower was sincerely intended to pass longitudinally over the body of
                        Mr. Collins from heel to head; and it was the time for a death-song. Black
                        Valkyrie hovered in the shrieking air.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Cut his gizzud out!&quot; shrieked Herman, urging on the
                        whirling knives.</p>
                    <p>They touched and lacerated the shin of Rupe, as, with the supreme agony of
                        effort a creature in mortal peril puts forth before succumbing, he tore
                        himself free of Herman and got upon his feet.</p>
                    <p>Herman was up as quickly. He leaped to the wall and seized the garden-scythe
                        that hung there.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-253" n="245"/>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m go to cut you&apos; gizzud out,&quot; he
                        announced definitely, &quot;an&apos; eat it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Rupe Collins had never run from anybody (except his father) in his life; he
                        was not a coward; but the present situation was very, very unusual. He was
                        already in a badly dismantled condition, and yet Herman and Verman seemed
                        discontented with their work: Verman was swinging the grass-cutter about for
                        a new charge, apparently still wishing to mow him, and Herman had made a
                        quite plausible statement about what he intended to do with the scythe.</p>
                    <p>Rupe paused but for an extremely condensed survey of the horrible advance of
                        the brothers, and then, uttering a blood-curdled scream of fear, ran out of
                        the stable and up the alley at a speed he had never before attained, so that
                        even Dan had hard work to keep within barking distance. And a
                        &apos;cross-shoulder glance, at the corner, revealing Verman and Herman
                        in pursuit, the latter waving his scythe overhead, Mr. Collins slackened not
                        his gait, but, rather, out of great anguish, increased it; the while a
                        rapidly developing purpose became firm in his mindand ever after so
                        remainednot only to refrain from visiting that neighbourhood again, but
                        never by any chance to come within a mile of it.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-254" n="246"/>
                    <p>From the alley door, Penrod and Sam watched the flight, and were without
                        words. When the pursuit rounded the corner, the two looked wanly at each
                        other, but neither spoke until the return of the brothers from the chase.</p>
                    <p>Herman and Verman came back, laughing and chuckling.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hiyi!&quot; cackled Herman to Verman, as they came,
                        &quot;See &apos;at ole boy run!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who-ee!&quot; Verman shouted in ecstasy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nev&apos; did see boy run so fas&apos;!&quot; Herman
                        continued, tossing the scythe into the wheelbarrow. &quot;I bet he home
                        in bed by viss time!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Verman roared with delight, appearing to be wholly unconscious that the lids
                        of his right eye were swollen shut and that his attire, not too finical
                        before the struggle, now entitled him to unquestioned rank as a <hi rend="i"
                            >sansculotte.</hi> Herman was a similar ruin, and gave as little heed to
                        his condition.</p>
                    <p>Penrod looked dazedly from Herman to Verman and back again. So did Sam
                        Williams.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Herman,&quot; said Penrod, in a weak voice, &quot;you
                        wouldn&apos;t <hi rend="i">honest</hi> of cut his gizzard out, would
                        you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who? Me? I don&apos; know. He mighty mean ole boy!&quot;
                        Herman shook his head gravely, and then, <pb id="VAA2383-255" n="247"/>
                        observing that Verman was again convulsed with unctuous merriment, joined
                        laughter with his brother. &quot;Sho! I guess I uz dess <hi rend="i"
                            >talkin&apos;</hi> whens I said &apos;at! Reckon he thought I
                        meant it, f&apos;m de way he tuck an&apos; run. Hiyi! Reckon he
                        thought ole Herman bad man! No, suh, I uz dess talkin&apos;,
                        &apos;cause I nev&apos; would cut <hi rend="i">nobody!</hi> I
                        ain&apos; tryin&apos; git in no jail<hi rend="i">no,</hi>
                        suh!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Penrod looked at the scythe: he looked at Herman. He looked at the
                        lawn-mower, and he looked at Verman. Then he looked out in the yard at the
                        rake. So did Sam Williams.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come on, Verman,&quot; said Herman. &quot;We ain&apos;
                        got &apos;at stove-wood f&apos; supper yit.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Giggling reminiscently, the brothers disappeared, leaving silence behind them
                        in the carriage-house. Penrod and Sam retired slowly into the shadowy
                        interior, each glancing, now and then, with a preoccupied air, at the open,
                        empty doorway where the late afternoon sunshine was growing ruddy. At
                        intervals one or the other scraped the floor reflectively with the side of
                        his shoe. Finally, still without either having made any effort at
                        conversation, they went out into the yard and stood, continuing their
                        silence.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-256" n="248"/>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Sam, at last, &quot;I guess it&apos;s
                        time I better be gettin&apos; home. So long, Penrod!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So long, Sam,&quot; said Penrod, feebly.</p>
                    <p>With a solemn gaze he watched his friend out of sight. Then he went slowly
                        into the house, and after an interval occupied in a unique manner, appeared
                        in the library, holding a pair of brilliantly gleaming shoes in his hand.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Schofield, reading the evening paper, glanced frowningly over it at his
                        offspring.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Look, papa,&quot; said Penrod. &quot;I found your shoes
                        where you&apos;d taken &apos;em off in your room, to put on your
                        slippers, and they were all dusty. So I took &apos;em out on the back
                        porch and gave &apos;em a good blacking. They shine up fine,
                        don&apos;t they?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I&apos;ll be d-dud-dummed!&quot; said the startled
                        Mr. Schofield.</p>
                    <p>Penrod was zigzagging back to normal.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="b">T</hi>HE midsummer sun was stinging hot outside the little
                        barber-shop next to the corner drug store and Penrod, undergoing a toilette
                        preliminary to his very slowly approaching twelfth birthday, was adhesive
                        enough to retain upon his face much hair as it fell from the shears. There
                        is a mystery here: the tonsorial processes are not unagreeable to manhood;
                        in truth, they are soothing; but the hairs detached from a boy&apos;s
                        head get into his eyes, his ears, his nose, his mouth, and down his neck,
                        and he does everywhere itch excruciatingly. <pb id="VAA2383-258" n="250"/>
                        Wherefore he blinks, winks, weeps, twitches, condenses his countenance, and
                        squirms; and perchance the barber&apos;s scissors clip more than
                        intendedbelike an outlying flange of ear.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ummuh<hi rend="i">ow!&quot;</hi> said Penrod, this thing having
                        happened.</p>
                    <p>&quot;D&apos; I touch <hi rend="i">y&apos;</hi> up a
                        little?&quot; inquired the barber, smiling falsely.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ooh<hi rend="i">uh!&quot;</hi> The boy in the chair offered
                        inarticulate protest, as the wound was rubbed with alum.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">&quot;That</hi> don&apos;t hurt!&quot; said the
                        barber. &quot;You <hi rend="i">will</hi> get it, though, if you
                        don&apos;t sit stiller,&quot; he continued, nipping in the bud any
                        attempt on the part of his patient to think that he already had
                        &quot;it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Pfuff!&quot; said Penrod, meaning no disrespect, but
                        endeavouring to dislodge a temporary moustache from his lip.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You ought to see how still that little Georgie Bassett
                        sits,&quot; the barber went on, reprovingly. &quot;I hear everybody
                        says he&apos;s the best boy in town.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Pfuff! <hi rend="i">Phirr!&quot;</hi> There was a touch of
                        intentional contempt in this.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I haven&apos;t heard nobody around the neighbour-hood
                        makin&apos; no such remarks,&quot; added the barber, &quot;about
                        nobody of the name of Penrod Schofield.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-259" n="251"/>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Penrod, clearing his mouth after a struggle,
                        &quot;who wants &apos;em to? Ouch!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I hear they call Georgie Bassett the &apos;little
                        gentleman,&apos;&quot; ventured the barber, provocatively, meeting
                        with instant success.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They better not call <hi rend="i">me</hi> that,&quot; returned
                        Penrod truculently. &quot;I&apos;d like to hear anybody try. Just
                        once, that&apos;s all! I bet they&apos;d never try it ag<hi rend="i"
                            >Ouch!&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>&quot;Why? What&apos;d you do to &apos;em?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s all right what I&apos;d <hi rend="i">do!</hi> I
                        bet they wouldn&apos;t want to call me that again long as they
                        lived!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;d you do if it was a little girl? You
                        wouldn&apos;t hit her, would you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I&apos;dOuch!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You wouldn&apos;t hit a little girl, would you?&quot; the
                        barber persisted, gathering into his powerful fingers a mop of hair from the
                        top of Penrod&apos;s head and pulling that suffering head into an
                        unnatural position. &quot;Doesn&apos;t the Bible say it
                        ain&apos;t never right to hit the weak sex?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ow! <hi rend="i">Say,</hi> look <hi rend="i">out!&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>&quot;So you&apos;d go and punch a pore, weak, little girl, would
                        you?&quot; said the barber, reprovingly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, who said I&apos;d hit her?&quot; demanded the <pb
                            id="VAA2383-260" n="252"/> chivalrous Penrod. &quot;I bet
                        I&apos;d <hi rend="i">fix</hi> her though, all right. She&apos;d
                        see!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You wouldn&apos;t call her names, would you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, I wouldn&apos;t! What hurt is it to call anybody
                        names?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is that <hi rend="i">so!&quot;</hi> exclaimed the barber.
                        &quot;Then you was intending what I heard you hollering at
                        Fisher&apos;s grocery delivery wagon driver fer a favour, the other day
                        when I was goin&apos; by your house, was you? I reckon I better tell
                        him, because he says to me after-<hi rend="i">werds</hi> if he ever lays
                        eyes on you when you ain&apos;t in your own yard, he&apos;s
                        goin&apos; to do a whole lot o&apos; things you ain&apos;t
                        goin&apos; to like! Yessir, that&apos;s what he says to <hi rend="i"
                            >me!&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>&quot;He better catch me first, I guess, before he talks so
                        much.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; resumed the barber, &quot;that ain&apos;t
                        sayin&apos; what you&apos;d do if a young lady ever walked up and
                        called you a little gentleman. <hi rend="i">I</hi> want to hear what
                        you&apos;d do to her. I guess I know, thoughcome to think of
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What?&quot; demanded Penrod.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;d sick that pore ole dog of yours on her cat, if she
                        had one, I expect,&quot; guessed the barber derisively.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-261" n="253"/>
                    <p>&quot;No, I would not!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, what <hi rend="i">would</hi> you do?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;d do enough. Don&apos;t worry about that!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, suppose it was a boy, then: what&apos;d you do if a boy
                        come up to you and says, &apos;Hello, little
                        gentleman&apos;?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;d be lucky,&quot; said Penrod, with a sinister
                        frown, &quot;if he got home alive.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Suppose it was a boy twice your size?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just let him try,&quot; said Penrod ominously. &quot;You
                        just let him try. He&apos;d never see daylight again; that&apos;s
                        all!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The barber dug ten active fingers into the helpless scalp before him and did
                        his best to displace it, while the anguished Penrod, becoming instantly a
                        seething crucible of emotion, misdirected his natural resentment into
                        maddened brooding upon what he would do to a boy &quot;twice his
                        size&quot; who should dare to call him &quot;little
                        gentleman.&quot; The barber shook him as his father had never shaken
                        him; the barber buffeted him, rocked him frantically to and fro; the barber
                        seemed to be trying to wring his neck; and Penrod saw himself in staggering
                        zigzag pictures, destroying large, screaming, fragmentary boys who had
                        insulted him.</p>
                    <p>The torture stopped suddenly; and clenched, weeping <pb id="VAA2383-262"
                            n="254"/> eyes began to see again, while the barber applied cooling
                        lotions which made Penrod smell like a coloured housemaid&apos;s ideal.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now what,&quot; asked the barber, combing the reeking locks
                        gently, &quot;what would it make you so mad fer, to have somebody call
                        you a little gentleman? It&apos;s a kind of compliment, as it were, you
                        might say. What would you want to hit anybody fer <hi rend="i">that</hi>
                        fer?&quot;</p>
                    <p>To the mind of Penrod, this question was without meaning or reasonableness.
                        It was within neither his power nor his desire to analyze the process by
                        which the phrase had become offensive to him, and was now rapidly assuming
                        the proportions of an outrage. He knew only that his gorge rose at the
                        thought of it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You just let &apos;em try it!&quot; he said threateningly,
                        as he slid down from the chair. And as he went out of the door, after
                        further conversation on the same subject, he called back those warning words
                        once more: &quot;Just let &apos;em try it! Just oncethat&apos;s
                        all <hi rend="i">I</hi> ask &apos;em to. They&apos;ll find out what
                        they <hi rend="i">get!&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The barber chuckled. Then a fly lit on the barber&apos;s nose and he
                        slapped at it, and the slap missed the fly but did not miss the nose. The
                        barber was irritated. At this moment his birdlike eye gleamed <pb
                            id="VAA2383-263" n="255"/> a gleam as it fell upon customers
                        approaching: the prettiest little girl in the world, leading by the hand her
                        baby brother, Mitchy-Mitch, coming to have Mitchy-Mitch&apos;s hair
                        clipped, against the heat.</p>
                    <p>It was a hot day and idle, with little to feed the mindand the barber was a
                        mischievous man with an irritated nose. He did his worst.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, the brooding Penrod pursued his homeward way; no great distance,
                        but long enough for several one-sided conflicts with malign insulters made
                        of thin air. &quot;You better <hi rend="i">not</hi> call me
                        that!&quot; he muttered. &quot;You just try it, and you&apos;ll
                        get what other people got when <hi rend="i">they</hi> tried it. You better
                        not ack fresh with <hi rend="i">me!</hi> Oh, you <hi rend="i">will,</hi>
                        will you?&quot; He delivered a vicious kick full upon the shins of an
                        iron fence-post, which suffered little, though Penrod instantly regretted
                        his indiscretion. &quot;Oof!&quot; he grunted, hopping; and went on
                        after bestowing a look of awful hostility upon the fence-post. &quot;I
                        guess you&apos;ll know better next time,&quot; he said, in parting,
                        to this antagonist. &quot;You just let me catch you around here again
                        and I&apos;ll&quot; His voice sank to inarticulate but ominous
                        murmurings. He was in a dangerous mood.</p>
                    <p>Nearing home, however, his belligerent spirit was <pb id="VAA2383-264"
                            n="256"/> diverted to happier interests by the discovery that some
                        workmen had left a caldron of tar in the cross-street, close by his
                        father&apos;s stable. He tested it, but found it inedible. Also, as a
                        substitute for professional chewing-gum it was unsatisfactory, being
                        insufficiently boiled down and too thin, though of a pleasant, lukewarm
                        temperature. But it had an excess of one qualityit was sticky. It was the
                        stickiest tar Penrod had ever used for any purposes whatsoever, and nothing
                        upon which he wiped his hands served to rid them of it; neither his
                        polka-dotted shirt waist nor his knickerbockers; neither the fence, nor even
                        Duke, who came unthinkingly wagging out to greet him, and retired wiser.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, tar is tar. Much can be done with it, no matter what its
                        condition; so Penrod lingered by the caldron, though from a neighbouring
                        yard could be heard the voices of comrades, including that of Sam Williams.
                        On the ground about the caldron were scattered chips and sticks and bits of
                        wood to the number of a great multitude. Penrod mixed quantities of this
                        refuse into the tar, and interested himself in seeing how much of it he
                        could keep moving in slow swirls upon the ebon surface.</p>
                    <p>Other surprises were arranged for the absent <pb id="VAA2383-265" n="257"/>
                        workmen. The caldron was almost full, and the surface of the tar near the
                        rim. Penrod endeavoured to ascertain how many pebbles and brickbats, dropped
                        in, would cause an overflow. Labouring heartily to this end, he had almost
                        accomplished it, when he received the suggestion for an experiment on a much
                        larger scale. Embedded at the corner of a grass-plot across the street was a
                        whitewashed stone, the size of a small watermelon and serving no purpose
                        whatever save the questionable one of decoration. It was easily pried up
                        with a stick; though getting it to the caldron tested the full strength of
                        the ardent labourer. Instructed to perform such a task, he would have
                        sincerely maintained its impossibility; but now, as it was unbidden, and
                        promised rather destructive results, he set about it with unconquerable
                        energy, feeling certain that he would be rewarded with a mighty splash.
                        Perspiring, grunting vehemently, his back aching and all muscles strained,
                        he progressed in short stages until the big stone lay at the base of the
                        caldron. He rested a moment, panting, then lifted the stone, and was bending
                        his shoulders for the heave that would lift it over the rim, when a sweet,
                        taunting voice, close behind him, startled him cruelly.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-266" n="258"/>
                    <p>&quot;How do you do, <hi rend="i">little gentleman!&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Penrod squawked, dropped the stone, and shouted, &quot;Shut up, you dern
                        fool!&quot; purely from instinct, even before his about-face made him
                        aware who had so spitefully addressed him.</p>
                    <p>It was Marjorie Jones. Always dainty, and prettily dressed, she was in
                        speckless and starchy white to-day, and a refreshing picture she made, with
                        the new-shorn and powerfully scented Mitchy-Mitch clinging to her hand. They
                        had stolen up behind the toiler, and now stood laughing together in sweet
                        merriment. Since the passing of Penrod&apos;s Rupe Collins period he had
                        experienced some severe qualms at the recollection of his last meeting with
                        Marjorie and his Apache behaviour; in truth, his heart instantly became as
                        wax at sight of her, and he would have offered her fair speech; but, alas!
                        in Marjorie&apos;s wonderful eyes there shone a consciousness of new
                        powers for his undoing, and she denied him opportunity.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, <hi rend="i">oh!&quot;</hi> she cried, mocking his pained
                        outcry. &quot;What a way for a <hi rend="i">little gentleman</hi> to
                        talk! Little gentleman don&apos;t say wicked&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Marjorie!&quot; Penrod, enraged and dismayed, felt himself
                        stung beyond all endurance. Insult from <pb id="VAA2383-267" n="259"/> her
                        was bitterer to endure than from any other. &quot;Don&apos;t you
                        call me that again!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why not, <hi rend="i">little gentleman?&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>He stamped his foot. &quot;You better stop!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Marjorie sent into his furious face her lovely, spiteful laughter.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Little gentleman, little gentleman, little gentleman!&quot; she
                        said deliberately. &quot;How&apos;s the little gentleman, this
                        afternoon? Hello, little gentleman!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Penrod, quite beside himself, danced eccentrically. &quot;Dry
                        up!&quot; he howled. &quot;Dry up, dry up, dry up, dry <hi rend="i"
                            >up!&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Mitchy-Mitch shouted with delight and applied a finger to the side of the
                        caldrona finger immediately snatched away and wiped upon a handkerchief by
                        his fastidious sister.</p>
                    <p>&quot; &apos;Ittle gellamun!&quot; said Mitchy-Mitch.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You better look out!&quot; Penrod whirled upon this small
                        offender with grim satisfaction. Here was at least something male that could
                        without dishonour be held responsible. &quot;You say that again, and
                        I&apos;ll give you the worst&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You will <hi rend="i">not!&quot;</hi> snapped Marjorie,
                        instantly vitriolic. &quot;He&apos;ll say just whatever he wants to,
                            <pb id="VAA2383-268" n="260"/> and he&apos;ll say it just as <hi
                            rend="i">much</hi> as he wants to. Say it again, Mitchy-Mitch!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot; &apos;Ittle gellamun!&quot; said Mitchy-Mitch promptly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ow-<hi rend="i">yah!&quot;</hi> Penrod&apos;s
                        tone-production was becoming affected by his mental condition. &quot;You
                        say that again, and I&apos;ll&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Go on, Mitchy-Mitch,&quot; cried Marjorie. &quot;He
                        can&apos;t do a thing. He don&apos;t <hi rend="i">dare!</hi> Say it
                        some more, Mitchy-Mitchsay it a whole lot!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mitchy-Mitch, his small, fat face shining with confidence in his immunity,
                        complied.</p>
                    <p>&quot; &apos;Ittle gellamun!&quot; he squeaked malevolently.
                        &quot; &apos;Ittle gellamun! &apos;Ittle gellamun!
                        &apos;Ittle gellamun!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The desperate Penrod bent over the whitewashed rock, lifted it, and
                        thenoutdoing Porthos, John Ridd, and Ursus in one miraculous burst of
                        strengthheaved it into the air.</p>
                    <p>Marjorie screamed.</p>
                    <p>But it was too late. The big stone descended into the precise midst of the
                        caldron and Penrod got his mighty splash. It was far, far beyond his
                        expectations.</p>
                    <p>Spontaneously there were grand and awful effectsvolcanic spectacles of
                        nightmare and eruption. <pb id="VAA2383-269" n="261"/> A black sheet of
                        eccentric shape rose out of the caldron and descended upon the three
                        children, who had no time to evade it.</p>
                    <p>After it fell, Mitchy-Mitch, who stood nearest the caldron, was the thickest,
                        though there was enough for all. Br&apos;er Rabbit would have fled from
                        any of them.</p>

                        <hi rend="b">W</hi>HEN Marjorie and Mitchy-Mitch got their breath, they used
                        it vocally; and seldom have more penetrating sounds issued from human
                        throats. Coincidentally, Marjorie, quite baresark, laid hands upon the
                        largest stick within reach and fell upon Penrod with blind fury. He had the
                        presence of mind to flee, and they went round and round the caldron, while
                        Mitchy-Mitch feebly endeavoured to followhis appearance, in this pursuit,
                        being pathetically like that of a bug fished out of an ink-well, alive but
                        discouraged.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-271" n="263"/>
                    <p>Attracted by the riot, Samuel Williams made his appearance, vaulting a fence,
                        and was immediately followed by Maurice Levy and Georgie Bassett. They
                        stared incredulously at the extraordinary spectacle before them.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Little GEN-TIL-MUN!&quot; shrieked Marjorie, with a wild stroke
                        that landed full upon Penrod&apos;s tarry cap.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">&quot;Oooch!&quot;</hi> bleated Penrod.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s Penrod!&quot; shouted Sam Williams, recognizing
                        him by the voice. For an instant he had been in some doubt.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Penrod Schofield!&quot; exclaimed Georgie Bassett. <hi rend="i"
                            >&quot;What</hi> does this mean?&quot; That was
                        Georgie&apos;s style, and had helped to win him his title.</p>
                    <p>Marjorie leaned, panting, upon her stick. &quot;I
                        cu-calleduhhimoh!&quot; she sobbed&quot;I called him a

                    <p>Unexpectedly, she smote againwith resultsand then, seizing the
                        indistinguishable hand of Mitchy-Mitch, she ran wailing homeward down the
                        street.</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;Little gentleman&apos;?&quot; said Georgie
                        Bassett, with <pb id="VAA2383-272" n="264"/> some evidences of disturbed
                        complacency. &quot;Why, that&apos;s what they call <hi rend="i"
                            >me!&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, and you <hi rend="i">are</hi> one, too!&quot; shouted the
                        maddened Penrod. &quot;But you better not let anybody call <hi rend="i"
                            >me</hi> that! I&apos;ve stood enough around here for one day, and
                        you can&apos;t run over <hi rend="i">me,</hi> Georgie Bassett. Just you
                        put that in your gizzard and smoke it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Anybody has a perfect right,&quot; said Georgie, with dignity,
                        &quot;to call a person a little gentleman. There&apos;s lots of
                        names nobody ought to call, but this one&apos;s a <hi rend="i"
                        >nice</hi>&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You better look out!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Unavenged bruises were distributed all over Penrod, both upon his body and
                        upon his spirit. Driven by subtle forces, he had dipped his hands in
                        catastrophe and disaster: it was not for a Georgie Bassett to beard him.
                        Penrod was about to run amuck.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I haven&apos;t called you a little gentleman, yet,&quot;
                        said Georgie. &quot;I only said it. Anybody&apos;s got a right to
                            <hi rend="i">say</hi> it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not around <hi rend="i">me!</hi> You just try it again
                        and&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I shall say it,&quot; returned Georgie, &quot;all I please.
                        Anybody in this town has a right to <hi rend="i">say</hi> &apos;little
                        gentleman&apos;&quot;</p>
                    <p>Bellowing insanely, Penrod plunged his right hand <pb id="VAA2383-273"
                            n="265"/> into the caldron, rushed upon Georgie and made awful work of
                        his hair and features.</p>
                    <p>Alas, it was but the beginning! Sam Williams and Maurice Levy screamed with
                        delight, and, simultaneously infected, danced about the struggling pair,
                        shouting frantically:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Little gentleman! Little gentleman! Sick him, Georgie! Sick him,
                        little gentleman! Little gentleman! Little gentleman!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The infuriated outlaw turned upon them with blows and more tar, which gave
                        Georgie Bassett his opportunity and later seriously impaired the purity of
                        his fame. Feeling himself hopelessly tarred, he dipped both hands repeatedly
                        into the caldron and applied his gatherings to Penrod. It was bringing coals
                        to Newcastle, but it helped to assuage the just wrath of Georgie.</p>
                    <p>The four boys gave a fine imitation of the Laocon group complicated by an

                        words issued from this tangle; hands dipped lavishly into the inexhaustible
                        reservoir of tar, with more and more picturesque results. The caldron had
                        been elevated upon bricks and was not perfectly balanced; and under a heavy
                        impact of the struggling <pb id="VAA2383-274" n="266"/> group it lurched and
                        went partly over, pouring forth a Stygian tide which formed a deep pool in
                        the gutter.</p>
                    <p>It was the fate of Master Roderick Bitts, that exclusive and immaculate
                        person, to make his appearance upon the chaotic scene at this juncture. All
                        in the cool of a white &quot;sailor suit,&quot; he turned aside from
                        the path of dutywhich led straight to the house of a maiden auntand paused
                        to hop with joy upon the sidewalk. A repeated epithet continuously half
                        panted, half squawked, somewhere in the nest of gladiators, caught his ear,
                        and he took it up excitedly, not knowing why.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Little gentleman!&quot; shouted Roderick, jumping up and down
                        in childish glee. &quot;Little gentleman! Little gentleman!
                        Lit&quot;</p>
                    <p>A frightful figure tore itself free from the group, encircled this innocent
                        bystander with a black arm, and hurled him headlong. Full length and flat on
                        his face went Roderick into the Stygian pool. The frightful figure was
                        Penrod. Instantly, the pack flung themselves upon him again, and, carrying
                        them with him, he went over upon Roderick, who from that instant was as
                        active a belligerent as any there.</p>
                    <p>Thus began the Great Tar Fight, the origin of which proved, afterward, so
                        difficult for parents to <pb id="VAA2383-275" n="[267]"/>

                        <pb id="VAA2383-276" n="268"/> trace, owing to the opposing accounts of the
                        combatants. Marjorie said Penrod began it; Penrod said Mitchy-Mitch began
                        it; Sam Williams said Georgie Bassett began it; Georgie and Maurice Levy
                        said Penrod began it; Roderick Bitts, who had not recognized his first
                        assailant, said Sam Williams began it.</p>
                    <p>Nobody thought of accusing the barber. But the barber did not begin it; it
                        was the fly on the barber&apos;s nose that began itthough, of course,
                        something else began the fly. Somehow, we never manage to hang the real
                        offender.</p>
                    <p>The end came only with the arrival of Penrod&apos;s mother, who had been
                        having a painful conversation by telephone with Mrs. Jones, the mother of
                        Marjorie, and came forth to seek an errant son. It is a mystery how she was
                        able to pick out her own, for by the time she got there his voice was too
                        hoarse to be recognizable.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Schofield&apos;s version of things was that Penrod was insane.
                        &quot;He&apos;s a stark, raving lunatic!&quot; declared the
                        father, descending to the library from a before-dinner interview with the
                        outlaw, that evening. &quot;I&apos;d send him to military school,
                        but I don&apos;t believe they&apos;d take him. Do you know <hi
                            rend="i">why</hi> he says all that awfulness happened?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-277" n="269"/>
                    <p>&quot;When Margaret and I were trying to scrub him,&quot; responded
                        Mrs. Schofield wearily, &quot;he said &apos;every-body&apos; had
                        been calling him names.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&apos;&quot;Names!&apos;&quot; snorted her husband.
                        &quot;&apos;Little gentleman!&apos; <hi rend="i"
                        >That&apos;s</hi> the vile epithet they called him! And because of it he
                        wrecks the peace of six homes!&quot;</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">&quot;Sh!</hi> Yes; he told us about it,&quot; said
                        Mrs. Schofield, moaning. &quot;He told us several hundred times, I
                        should guess, though I didn&apos;t count. He&apos;s got it fixed in
                        his head, and we couldn&apos;t get it out. All we could do was to put
                        him in the closet. He&apos;d have gone out again after those boys if we
                        hadn&apos;t. I don&apos;t know <hi rend="i">what</hi> to make of
                        him!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;s a mystery to <hi rend="i">me!&quot;</hi> said her
                        husband. &quot;And he refuses to explain why he objects to being called
                        &apos;little gentleman.&apos; Says he&apos;d do the same
                        thingand worseif anybody dared to call him that again. He said if the
                        President of the United States called him that he&apos;d try to whip
                        him. How long did you have him locked up in the closet?&quot;</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">&quot;Sh!&quot;</hi> said Mrs. Schofield warningly.
                        &quot;About two hours; but I don&apos;t think it softened his spirit
                        at all, because when I took him to the barber&apos;s to get his hair
                        clipped again, on account of the tar in it <pb id="VAA2383-278" n="270"/>
                        Sammy Williams and Maurice Levy were there for the same reason, and they
                        just <hi rend="i">whispered</hi> &apos;little gentleman,&apos; so
                        low you could hardly hear themand Penrod began fighting with them right
                        before me, and it was really all the barber and I could do to drag him away
                        from them. The barber was very kind about it, but Penrod&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I tell you he&apos;s a lunatic!&quot; Mr. Schofield would
                        have said the same thing of a Frenchman infuriated by the epithet
                        &quot;camel.&quot; The philosophy of insult needs expounding.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">&quot;Sh!&quot;</hi> said Mrs. Schofield. &quot;It
                        does seem a kind of frenzy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why on earth should any sane person mind being called&quot;</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">&quot;Sh!&quot;</hi> said Mrs. Schofield.
                        &quot;It&apos;s beyond <hi rend="i">me!&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>&quot;What are you <hi rend="i">sh</hi>-ing me for?&quot; demanded
                        Mr. Schofield explosively.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">&quot;Sh!&quot;</hi> said Mrs. Schofield.
                        &quot;It&apos;s Mr. Kinosling, the new rector of Saint
                        Joseph&apos;s.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where?&quot;</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">&quot;Sh!</hi> On the front porch with Margaret;
                        he&apos;s going to stay for dinner. I do hope&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Bachelor, isn&apos;t he?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-279" n="271"/>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">&quot;Our</hi> old minister was speaking of him the other
                        day,&quot; said Mr. Schofield, &quot;and he didn&apos;t seem so
                        terribly impressed.&quot;</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">&quot;Sh!</hi> Yes; about thirty, and of course <hi
                            rend="i">so</hi> superior to most of Margaret&apos;s friendsboys
                        home from college. She thinks she likes young Robert Williams, I knowbut he
                        laughs so much! Of course there isn&apos;t any comparison. Mr. Kinosling
                        talks so intellectually; it&apos;s a good thing for Margaret to hear
                        that kind of thing, for a changeand, of course, he&apos;s very
                        spiritual. He seems very much interested in her.&quot; She paused to
                        muse. &quot;I think Margaret likes him; he&apos;s so different, too.
                        It&apos;s the third time he&apos;s dropped in this week, and
                        I&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Mr. Schofield grimly, &quot;if you and
                        Margaret want him to come again, you&apos;d better not let him see
                        Penrod.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But he&apos;s asked to see him; he seems interested in meeting
                        all the family. And Penrod nearly always behaves fairly well at
                        table.&quot; She paused, and then put to her husband a question
                        referring to his interview with Penrod upstairs. &quot;Did youdid youdo
                        it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No.&quot; he answered gloomily. &quot;No, I
                        didn&apos;t, but&quot; He was interrupted by a violent crash of <pb
                            id="VAA2383-280" n="272"/> china and metal in the kitchen, a shriek from
                        Della, and the outrageous voice of Penrod. The well-informed Della,
                        ill-inspired to set up for a wit, had ventured to address the scion of the
                        house roguishly as &quot;little gentleman,&quot; and Penrod, by
                        means of the rapid elevation of his right foot, had removed from her
                        supporting hands a laden tray. Both parents started for the kitchen, Mr.
                        Schofield completing his interrupted sentence on the way.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I will, now!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The rite thus promised was hastily but accurately performed in that apartment
                        most distant from the front porch; and, twenty minutes later, Penrod
                        descended to dinner. The Rev. Mr. Kinosling had asked for the pleasure of
                        meeting him, and it had been decided that the only course possible was to
                        cover up the scandal for the present, and to offer an undisturbed and
                        smiling family surface to the gaze of the visitor.</p>
                    <p>Scorched but not bowed, the smouldering Penrod was led forward for the social
                        formul simultaneously with the somewhat bleak departure of Robert Williams,
                        who took his guitar with him, this time, and went in forlorn unconsciousness
                        of the powerful forces already set in secret motion to be his allies.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-281" n="273"/>
                    <p>The punishment just undergone had but made the haughty and unyielding soul of
                        Penrod more stalwart in revolt; he was unconquered. Every time the one
                        intolerable insult had been offered him, his resentment had become the
                        hotter, his vengeance the more instant and furious. And, still burning with
                        outrage, but upheld by the conviction of right, he was determined to
                        continue to the last drop of his blood the defense of his honour, whenever
                        it should be assailed, no matter how mighty or august the powers that
                        attacked it. In all ways, he was a very sore boy.</p>
                    <p>During the brief ceremony of presentation, his usually inscrutable
                        countenance wore an expression interpreted by his father as one of insane
                        obstinacy, while Mrs. Schofield found it an incentive to inward prayer. The
                        fine graciousness of Mr. Kinosling, however, was unimpaired by the glare of
                        virulent suspicion given him by this little brother: Mr. Kinosling mistook
                        it for a natural curiosity concerning one who might possibly become, in
                        time, a member of the family. He patted Penrod upon the head, which was, for
                        many reasons, in no condition to be patted with any pleasure to the patter.
                        Penrod felt himself in the presence of a new enemy.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-282" n="274"/>
                    <p>&quot;How do you do, my little lad,&quot; said Mr. Kinosling.
                        &quot;I trust we shall become fast friends.&quot;</p>
                    <p>To the ear of his little lad, it seemed he said, &quot;A trost we shall
                        bick-home fawst frainds.&quot; Mr. Kinosling&apos;s pronunciation
                        was, in fact, slightly precious; and the little lad, simply mistaking it for
                        some cryptic form of mockery of himself, assumed a manner and expression
                        which argued so ill for the proposed friendship that Mrs. Schofield hastily
                        interposed the suggestion of dinner, and the small procession went in to the
                        dining-room.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It has been a delicious day,&quot; said Mr. Kinosling,
                        presently; &quot;warm but balmy.&quot; With a benevolent smile he
                        addressed Penrod, who sat opposite him. &quot;I suppose, little
                        gentleman, you have been indulging in the usual outdoor sports of
                        vacation?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Penrod laid down his fork and glared, open-mouthed at Mr. Kinosling.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ll have another slice of breast of the
                        chicken?&quot; Mr. Schofield inquired, loudly and quickly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A lovely day!&quot; exclaimed Margaret, with equal promptitude
                        and emphasis. &quot;Lovely, oh, lovely! Lovely!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!&quot; said Mrs. Schofield, and
                        after a glance at Penrod which confirmed <pb id="VAA2383-283" n="275"/> her
                        impression that he intended to say something, she continued, &quot;Yes,
                        beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful beautiful!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Penrod closed his mouth and sank back in his chairand his relatives took
                        breath.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Kinosling looked pleased. This responsive family, with its ready
                        enthusiasm, made the kind of audience he liked. He passed a delicate white
                        hand gracefully over his tall, pale forehead, and smiled indulgently.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Youth relaxes in summer,&quot; he said. &quot;Boyhood is
                        the age of relaxation; one is playful, light, free, unfettered. One runs and
                        leaps and enjoys one&apos;s self with one&apos;s companions. It is
                        good for the little lads to play with their friends; they jostle, push, and
                        wrestle, and simulate little, happy struggles with one another in harmless
                        conflict. The young muscles are toughening. It is good. Boyish chivalry
                        develops, enlarges, expands. The young learn quickly, intuitively,
                        spontaneously. They perceive the obligations of <hi rend="i">noblesse

                        means to be well born. They learn courtesy in their games; they learn
                        politeness, consideration <pb id="VAA2383-284" n="276"/> for one another in
                        their pastimes, amusements, lighter occupations. I make it my pleasure to
                        join them often, for I sympathize with them in all their wholesome joys as
                        well as in their little bothers and perplexities. I understand them, you
                        see; and let me tell you it is no easy matter to understand the little lads
                        and lassies.&quot; He sent to each listener his beaming glance, and,
                        permitting it to come to rest upon Penrod, inquired:</p>
                    <p>&quot;And what do you say to that, little gentleman?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mr. Schofield uttered a stentorian cough. &quot;More? You&apos;d
                        better have some more chicken! More! Do!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;More chicken!&quot; urged Margaret simultaneously, &quot;Do
                        please! Please! More! Do! More!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Beautiful, beautiful,&quot; began Mrs. Schofield.
                        &quot;Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful&quot;</p>
                    <p>It is not known in what light Mr. Kinosling viewed the expression of
                        Penrod&apos;s face. Perhaps he mis-took it for awe; perhaps he received
                        no impression at all of its extraordinary quality. He was a rather
                        self-engrossed young man, just then engaged in a double occupation, for he
                        not only talked, but supplied from his own consciousness a critical though
                        favourable auditor as well, which of course kept him quite busy. Besides, it
                        is oftener than is suspected <pb id="VAA2383-285" n="277"/> the case that
                        extremely peculiar expressions upon the countenances of boys are entirely
                        overlooked, and suggest nothing to the minds of people staring straight at
                        them. Certainly Penrod&apos;s expressionwhich, to the perception of his
                        family, was perfectly horriblecaused not the faintest perturbation in the
                        breast of Mr. Kinosling.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Kinosling waived the chicken, and continued to talk. &quot;Yes, I
                        think I may claim to understand boys,&quot; he said, smiling
                        thoughtfully. &quot;One has been a boy one&apos;s self. Ah, it is
                        not all playtime! I hope our young scholar here does not overwork himself at
                        his Latin, at his classics, as I did, so that at the age of eight years I
                        was compelled to wear glasses. He must be careful not to strain the little
                        eyes at his scholar&apos;s tasks, not to let the little shoulders grow
                        round over his scholar&apos;s desk. Youth is golden; we should keep it
                        golden, bright, glistening. Youth should frolic, should be sprightly; it
                        should play its cricket, its tennis, its hand-ball. It should run and leap;
                        it should laugh, should sing madrigals and glees, carol with the lark, ring
                        out in chanties, folk-songs, ballads, roundelays&quot;</p>
                    <p>He talked on. At any instant Mr. Schofield held himself ready to cough
                        vehemently and shout, &quot;More <pb id="VAA2383-286" n="278"/>
                        chicken,&quot; to drown out Penrod in case the fatal words again fell
                        from those eloquent lips; and Mrs. Schofield and Margaret kept themselves
                        prepared at all times to assist him. So passed a threatening meal, which
                        Mrs. Schofield hurried, by every means with decency, to its conclusion. She
                        felt that somehow they would all be safer out in the dark of the front
                        porch, and led the way thither as soon as possible.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No cigar, I thank you.&quot; Mr Kinosling, establishing himself
                        in a wicker chair beside Margaret, waved away her father&apos;s proffer.
                        &quot;I do not smoke. I have never tasted tobacco in any form.&quot;
                        Mrs. Schofield was confirmed in her opinion that this would be an ideal
                        son-in-law. Mr. Schofield was not so sure.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said Mr. Kinosling. &quot;No tobacco for me. No
                        cigar, no pipe, no cigarette, no cheroot. For me, a booka volume of poems,
                        perhaps. Verses, rhymes, lines metrical and cadencedthose are my
                        dissipation. Tennyson by preference: &apos;Maud,&apos; or
                        &apos;Idylls of the King&apos;poetry of the sound Victorian days;
                        there is none later. Or Longfellow will rest me in a tired hour. Yes; for
                        me, a book, a volume in the hand, held lightly between the
                        fingers.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mr. Kinosling looked pleasantly at his fingers as <pb id="VAA2383-287"
                            n="279"/> he spoke, waving his hand in a curving gesture which brought
                        it into the light of a window faintly illumined from the interior of the
                        house. Then he passed those graceful fingers over his hair, and turned
                        toward Penrod, who was perched upon the railing in a dark corner.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The evening is touched with a slight coolness,&quot; said Mr.
                        Kinosling. &quot;Perhaps I may request the little gentleman&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;B&apos;gr-r-<hi rend="i">ruff!&quot;</hi> coughed Mr.
                        Schofield. &quot;You&apos;d better change your mind about a
                        cigar.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, I thank you. I was about to request the lit&quot;</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">&quot;Do</hi> try one,&quot; Margaret urged.
                        &quot;I&apos;m sure papa&apos;s are mice ones. Do try&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, I thank you. I remarked a slight coolness in the air, and my
                        hat is in the hallway. I was about to request&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll get it for you,&quot; said Penrod suddenly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If you will be so good,&quot; said Mr. Kinosling. &quot;It
                        is a black bowler hat, little gentleman, and placed upon a table in the
                        hall.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know where it is.&quot; Penrod entered the door, and a
                        feeling of relief, mutually experienced, carried from one to another of his
                        three relatives their interchanged <pb id="VAA2383-288" n="280"/>
                        congratulations that he had recovered his sanity.</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;The day is done, and the darkness,&apos;&quot;
                        began Mr. Kinoslingand recited that poem entire. He followed it with
                        &quot;The Children&apos;s Hour,&quot; and after a pause, at the
                        close, to allow his listeners time for a little reflection upon his
                        rendition, he passed his hand again over his head, and called, in the
                        direction of the doorway:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I believe I will take my hat now, little gentleman.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Here it is,&quot; said Penrod, unexpectedly climbing over the
                        porch railing, in the other direction. His mother and father and Margaret
                        had supposed him to be standing in the hallway out of deference, one because
                        he thought it tactful not to interrupt the recitations. All of them
                        remembered, later, that this supposed thoughtfulness on his part struck them
                        as unnatural.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Very good, little gentleman!&quot; said Mr. Kinosling, and
                        being somewhat chilled, placed the hat firmly upon his head, pulling it down
                        as far as it would go. It had a pleasant warmth, which he noticed at once.
                        The next instant, he noticed something else, a peculiar sensation of the
                        scalpa sensation which he was quite unable to define. He lifted his hand to
                        take <pb id="VAA2383-289" n="281"/> the hat off, and entered upon a strange
                        experience: his hat seemed to have decided to remain where it was.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you like Tennyson as much as Longfellow, Mr.
                        Kinosling?&quot; inquired Margaret.</p>
                    <p>&quot;IahI cannot say,&quot; he returned absently. &quot;Iaheach
                        has his ownugh! flavour and savour, each hisahah&quot;</p>
                    <p>Struck by a strangeness in his tone, she peered at him curiously through the
                        dusk. His outlines were indistinct, but she made out that his arms were
                        uplifted in a singular gesture. He seemed to be wrenching at his head.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Isis anything the matter?&quot; she asked anxiously.
                        &quot;Mr. Kinosling, are you ill?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not atugh!all,&quot; he replied, in the same odd tone.
                        &quot;IahI believe<hi rend="i">ugh!&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>He dropped his hands from his hat, and rose. His manner was slightly
                        agitated. &quot;I fear I may have taken a triflingahcold. I
                        shouldahperhaps beahbetter at home. I willahsay good-night.&quot;</p>
                    <p>At the steps, he instinctively lifted his hand to remove his hat, but did not
                        do so, and, saying &quot;Goodnight,&quot; again in a frigid voice,
                        departed with visible stiffness from that house, to return no more.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-290" n="282"/>
                    <p>&quot;Well, of all!&quot; cried Mrs. Schofield, astounded.
                        &quot;What was the matter? He just wentlike that!&quot; She made a
                        flurried gesture. &quot;In heaven&apos;s name, Margaret, what <hi
                            rend="i">did</hi> you say to him?&quot;</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">&quot;I!&quot;</hi> exclaimed Margaret indignantly.
                        &quot;Nothing! He just <hi rend="i">went!&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, he didn&apos;t even take off his hat when he said
                        good-night!&quot; said Mrs. Schofield.</p>
                    <p>Margaret, who had crossed to the doorway, caught the ghost of a whisper
                        behind her, where stood Penrod.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">&quot;You bet he didn&apos;t!&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>He knew not that he was overheard.</p>
                    <p>A frightful suspicion flashed through Margaret&apos;s minda suspicion
                        that Mr. Kinosling&apos;s hat would have to be either boiled off or
                        shaved off. With growing horror she recalled Penrod&apos;s long absence
                        when he went to bring the hat.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Penrod,&quot; she cried, &quot;let me see your
                        hands!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She had toiled at those hands herself late that afternoon, nearly scalding
                        her own, but at last achieving a lily purity.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let me see your hands!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She seized them.</p>
                    <p>Again they were tarred!</p>

                        real intentions in the matter of pain if they would examine a boy&apos;s
                        punishments and sorrows, for he prolongs neither beyond their actual
                        duration. With a boy, trouble must be of Homeric dimensions to last
                        overnight. To him, every next day is really a new day. Thus, Penrod woke,
                        next morning, with neither the unspared rod, nor Mr. Kinosling in his mind.
                        Tar, itself, so far as his consideration of it went, might have been an
                        undiscovered substance. His mood was cheerful <pb id="VAA2383-292" n="284"/>
                        and mercantile; some process having worked mysteriously within him, during
                        the night, to the result that his first waking thought was of profits
                        connected with the sale of old ironor perhaps a ragman had passed the house,
                        just before he woke.</p>
                    <p>By ten o&apos;clock he had formed a partnership with the indeed amiable
                        Sam, and the firm of Schofield and Williams plunged headlong into commerce.
                        Heavy dealings in rags, paper, old iron and lead gave the firm a balance of
                        twenty-two cents on the evening of the third day; but a venture in
                        glassware, following, proved disappointing on account of the scepticism of
                        all the druggists in that part of town, even after seven laborious hours had
                        been spent in cleansing a wheelbarrow-load of old medicine bottles with
                        hydrant water and ashes. Likewise, the partners were disheartened by their
                        failure to dispose of a crop of &quot;greens,&quot; although they
                        had uprooted specimens of that decorative and unappreciated flower, the
                        dandelion, with such persistence and energy that the Schofields&apos;
                        and Williams&apos; lawns looked curiously haggard for the rest of that
                        summer.</p>
                    <p>The fit passed: business languished; became extinct. The dog-days had set in.</p>
                    <p>One August afternoon was so hot that even boys <pb id="VAA2383-293" n="285"/>
                        sought indoor shade. In the dimness of the vacant carriage-house of the
                        stable, lounged Masters Penrod Schofield, Samuel Williams, Maurice Levy,
                        Georgie Bassett, and Herman. They sat still and talked. It is a hot day, in
                        rare truth, when boys devote themselves principally to conversation, and
                        this day was that hot.</p>
                    <p>Their elders should beware such days. Peril hovers near when the fierceness
                        of weather forces inaction and boys in groups are quiet. The more closely
                        volcanoes, Western rivers, nitroglycerin, and boys are pent, the deadlier is
                        their action at the point of outbreak. Thus, parents and guardians should
                        look for outrages of the most singular violence and of the most peculiar
                        nature during the confining weather of February and August.</p>
                    <p>The thing which befell upon this broiling afternoon began to brew and stew
                        peacefully enough. All was innocence and languor; no one could have foretold
                        the eruption.</p>
                    <p>They were upon their great theme: &quot;When I get to be a man!&quot;
                        Being human, though boys, they considered their present estate too
                        commonplace to be dwelt upon. So, when the old men gather, they say:
                        &quot;When I was a boy!&quot; It really is the land of nowadays that
                        we never discover.</p>

                    <p>&quot;When I&apos;m a man,&quot; said Sam Williams,
                        &quot;I&apos;m goin&apos; to hire me a couple of coloured
                        waiters to swing me in a hammock and keep pourin&apos; ice-water on me
                        all day out o&apos; those waterin&apos;-cans they sprinkle flowers
                        from. I&apos;ll hire you for one of &apos;em, Herman.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No; you ain&apos; goin&apos; to,&quot; said Herman
                        promptly. &quot;You ain&apos; no flowuh. But nev&apos;
                        min&apos; nat, anyway. Ain&apos; nobody goin&apos; hiah me whens

                    <p>&quot;You mean like a superintendent, or sumpthing like that, and sell
                        tickets?&quot; asked Penrod.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sup&apos;innev&apos; min&apos; nat! Sell ticket? <hi

                    <p>&quot;Generals get a lot more buttons than porters,&quot; said
                        Penrod. &quot;Generals&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Po&apos;tuhs make the bes&apos; livin&apos;,&quot;
                        Herman interrupted. &quot;My uncle spen&apos; mo&apos; money
                        &apos;n any white man n&apos;is town.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I rather be a general,&quot; said Penrod, &quot;or a
                        senator, or sumpthing like that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Senators live in Warshington,&quot; Maurice Levy contributed
                        the information. &quot;I been there. Warshington ain&apos;t so much;
                        Niag&apos;ra Falls is a hundred times as good as Warshington.
                        So&apos;s &apos;Tlantic City, <pb id="VAA2383-295" n="287"/> I was
                        there, too. I been everywhere there is. I&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, anyway,&quot; said Sam Williams, raising his voice in
                        order to obtain the floor, &quot;anyway, I&apos;m goin&apos; to
                        lay in a hammock all day, and have ice-water sprinkled on top o&apos;
                        me, and I&apos;m goin&apos; to lay there all night, too, and the
                        next day. I&apos;m goin&apos; to lay there a couple o&apos;
                        years, maybe.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I bet you don&apos;t!&quot; exclaimed Maurice.
                        &quot;What&apos;d you do in winter?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What you goin&apos; to do when it&apos;s winter, out in a
                        hammock with water sprinkled on top o&apos; you all day? I bet
                        you&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;d stay right there,&quot; Sam declared, with strong
                        conviction, blinking as he looked out through the open doors at the dazzling
                        lawn and trees, trembling in the heat. &quot;They couldn&apos;t
                        sprinkle too much for <hi rend="i">me!&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;d make icicles all over you, and&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wish it would,&quot; said Sam. &quot;I&apos;d eat
                        &apos;em up.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And it&apos;d snow on you&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yay! I&apos;d swaller it as fast as it&apos;d come down. I
                        wish I had a <hi rend="i">barrel</hi> o&apos; snow right now. I wish
                        this whole barn was full of it. I wish they wasn&apos;t anything <pb
                            id="VAA2383-296" n="288"/> in the whole world except just good ole
                        snow.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Penrod and Herman rose and went out to the hydrant, where they drank long and
                        ardently. Sam was still talking about snow when they returned.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, I wouldn&apos;t just roll in it. I&apos;d stick it all
                        round inside my clo&apos;es, and fill my hat. No, I&apos;d freeze a
                        big pile of it all hard, and I&apos;d roll her out flat and then
                        I&apos;d carry her down to some ole tailor&apos;s and have him make
                        me a <hi rend="i">suit</hi> out of her, and&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Can&apos;t you keep still about your ole snow?&quot;
                        demanded Penrod petulantly. &quot;Makes me so thirsty I can&apos;t
                        keep still, and I&apos;ve drunk so much now I bet I bust. That ole
                        hydrant water&apos;s mighty near hot anyway.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m goin&apos; to have a big store, when I grow
                        up,&quot; volunteered Maurice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Candy store?&quot; asked Penrod.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">&quot;No,</hi> sir! I&apos;ll have candy in it, but not
                        to eat, so much. It&apos;s goin&apos; to be a deportment store:
                        ladies&apos; clothes, gentlemen&apos;s clothes, neckties, china
                        goods, leather goods, nice lines in woollings and lace goods&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yay! I wouldn&apos;t give a five-for-a-cent marble for your
                        whole store,&quot; said Sam. &quot;Would you, Penrod?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-297" n="289"/>
                    <p>&quot;Not for ten of &apos;em; not for a million of &apos;em! <hi
                            rend="i">I</hi>&apos;m goin&apos; to have&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wait!&quot; clamoured Maurice. &quot;You&apos;d be
                        foolish, because they&apos;d be a toy deportment in my store where
                        they&apos;d be a hunderd marbles! So, how much would you think your
                        five-for-a-cent marble counts for? And when I&apos;m keepin&apos; my
                        store I&apos;m goin&apos; to get married.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yay!&quot; shrieked Sam derisively. <hi rend="i"
                            >&quot;Married!</hi> Listen!&quot; Penrod and Herman joined in
                        the howl of contempt.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Certumly I&apos;ll get married,&quot; asserted Maurice
                        stoutly. &quot;I&apos;ll get married to Marjorie Jones. She likes me
                        awful good, and I&apos;m her beau.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What makes you think so?&quot; inquired Penrod in a cryptic
                        voice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Because she&apos;s my beau, too,&quot; came the prompt
                        answer. &quot;I&apos;m her beau because she&apos;s my beau; I
                        guess that&apos;s plenty reason! I&apos;ll get married to her as
                        soon as I get my store running nice.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Penrod looked upon him darkly, but, for the moment, held his peace.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Married!&quot; jeered Sam Williams. &quot;Married to
                        Marjorie Jones! You&apos;re the only boy I ever heard say he was going
                        to get married. I wouldn&apos;t get married forwhy, I wouldn&apos;t
                        forfor&quot; <pb id="VAA2383-298" n="290"/> Unable to think of any
                        inducement the mere mention of which would not be ridiculously
                        incommensurate, he proceeded: &quot;I wouldn&apos;t do it! What you
                        want to get married for? What do married people do, except just come home
                        tired, and worry around and kind of scold? You better not do it,
                        M&apos;rice; you&apos;ll be mighty sorry.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Everybody gets married,&quot; stated Maurice, holding his
                        ground. &quot;They gotta.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll bet <hi rend="i">I</hi> don&apos;t!&quot; Sam
                        returned hotly. &quot;They better catch me before they tell <hi rend="i"
                            >me</hi> I have to. Anyway, I bet nobody has to get married unless they
                        want to.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;They do, too,&quot; insisted Maurice. &quot;They <hi
                            rend="i">gotta!&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>&quot;Who told you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Look at what my own papa told me!&quot; cried Maurice, heated
                        with argument. &quot;Didn&apos;t he tell me your papa had to marry
                        your mamma, or else he never&apos;d got to handle a cent of her money?
                        Certumly, people gotta marry. Everybody. You don&apos;t know anybody
                        over twenty years old that isn&apos;t marriedexcept maybe
                        teachers.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Look at policemen!&quot; shouted Sam triumphantly.
                        &quot;You don&apos;t s&apos;pose anybody can make policemen get
                        married, I reckon, do you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, policemen, maybe,&quot; Maurice was forced <pb
                            id="VAA2383-299" n="291"/> to admit. &quot;Policemen and teachers
                        don&apos;t, but everybody else gotta.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I&apos;ll be a policeman,&quot; said Sam. <hi
                            rend="i">&quot;Then</hi> I guess they won&apos;t come around
                        tellin&apos; me I have to get married. What you goin&apos; to be,
                        Penrod?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Chief police,&quot; said the laconic Penrod.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What you?&quot; Sam inquired of quiet Georgie Bassett.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am going to be,&quot; said Georgie, consciously, &quot;a
                        minister.&quot;</p>
                    <p>This announcement created a sensation so profound that it was followed by
                        silence. Herman was the first to speak.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You mean preachuh?&quot; he asked incredulously. &quot;You
                        go&apos; <hi rend="i">preach?&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; answered Georgie, looking like Saint Cecilia at the
                        organ.</p>
                    <p>Herman was impressed. &quot;You know all &apos;at preachuh
                        talk?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m going to learn it,&quot; said Georgie simply.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How loud kin you holler?&quot; asked Herman doubtfully.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He can&apos;t holler at all,&quot; Penrod interposed with
                        scorn. &quot;He hollers like a girl. He&apos;s the poorest hollerer
                        in town!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-300" n="292"/>
                    <p>Herman shook his head. Evidently he thought Georgie&apos;s chance of
                        being ordained very slender. Nevertheless, a final question put to the
                        candidate by the coloured expert seemed to admit one ray of hope.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How good kin you clim a pole?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He can&apos;t climb one at all,&quot; Penrod answered for
                        Georgie. &quot;Over at Sam&apos;s turning-pole you ought to see him
                        try to&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Preachers don&apos;t have to climb poles,&quot; Georgie
                        said with dignity.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">&quot;Good</hi> ones do,&quot; declared Herman.
                        &quot;Bes&apos; one ev&apos; <hi rend="i">I</hi> hear, he clim

                    <p>Herman possessed that extraordinary facility for vivid acting which is the
                        great native gift of his race, and he enchained his listeners. They sat
                        fascinated and spellbound.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Herman, tell that again!&quot; said Penrod, breathlessly.</p>
                    <p>Herman, nothing loath, accepted the encore and repeated the Miltonic episode,
                        expanding it somewhat, and dwelling with a fine art upon those portions of
                        the narrative which he perceived to be most exciting to his audience.
                        Plainly, they thrilled less to Paradise gained than to its losing, and the
                        dreadful climax of the descent into the Pit was the greatest treat of all.</p>
                    <p>The effect was immense and instant. Penrod sprang to his feet.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Georgie Bassett couldn&apos;t do that to save his <pb
                            id="VAA2383-302" n="294"/> life,&quot; he declared. &quot;<hi
                            rend="i">I</hi>&apos;m goin&apos; to be a preacher! <hi rend="i"
                            >I</hi>&apos;d be all right for one, wouldn&apos;t I,
                        Herman?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So am I!&quot; Sam Williams echoed loudly. &quot;I guess I
                        can do it if <hi rend="i">you</hi> can. I&apos;d be better&apos;n
                        Penrod, wouldn&apos;t I, Herman?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am, too!&quot; Maurice shouted. &quot;I got a stronger
                        voice than anybody here, and I&apos;d like to know what&quot;</p>
                    <p>The three clamoured together indistinguishably, each asserting his
                        qualifications for the ministry according to Herman&apos;s theory, which
                        had been accepted by these sudden converts without question.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Listen to <hi rend="i">me!</hi>&quot; Maurice bellowed, proving
                        his claim to at least the voice by drowning the others. &quot;Maybe I
                        can&apos;t climb a pole so good, but who can holler louder&apos;n
                        this? Listen to <hi rend="i">me-e-e!</hi>&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Shut up!&quot; cried Penrod, irritated. &quot;Go to heaven;
                        go to hell!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oo-o-oh!&quot; exclaimed Georgie Bassett, profoundly shocked.</p>
                    <p>Sam and Maurice, awed by Penrod&apos;s daring, ceased from turmoil,
                        staring wide-eyed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You cursed and swore!&quot; said Georgie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I did not!&quot; cried Penrod, hotly. &quot;That
                        isn&apos;t swearing.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-303" n="295"/>
                    <p>&quot;You said, &apos;Go to a big H&apos;!&quot; said
                        Georgie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I did not! I said, &apos;Go to heaven,&apos; before I said
                        a big H. That isn&apos;t swearing, is it, Herman? It&apos;s almost
                        what the preacher said, ain&apos;t it, Herman? It ain&apos;t
                        swearing now, any morenot if you put &apos;go to heaven&apos; with
                        it, is it, Herman? You can say it all you want to, long as you say
                        &apos;go to heaven&apos; first, <hi rend="i">can&apos;t</hi>
                        you, Herman? Anybody can say it if the preacher says it, can&apos;t
                        they, Herman? I guess I know when I ain&apos;t swearing, don&apos;t
                        I, Herman?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Judge Herman ruled for the defendant, and Penrod was considered to have
                        carried his point. With fine consistency, the conclave established that it
                        was proper for the general public to &quot;say it,&quot; provided
                        &quot;go to heaven&quot; should in all cases precede it. This prefix
                        was pronounced a perfect disinfectant, removing all odour of impiety or
                        insult; and, with the exception of Georgie Bassett (who maintained that the
                        minister&apos;s words were &quot;going&quot; and
                        &quot;gone,&quot; not &quot;go&quot;), all the boys
                        proceeded to exercise their new privilege so lavishly that they tired of it.</p>
                    <p>But there was no diminution of evangelical ardour; again were heard the
                        clamours of dispute as to which was the best qualified for the ministry,
                        each of the claimants appealing passionately to Herman, <pb id="VAA2383-304"
                            n="296"/> who, pleased but confused, appeared to be incapable of
                        arriving at a decision.</p>
                    <p>During a pause, Georgie Bassett asserted his prior rights. &quot;Who said
                        it first, I&apos;d like to know?&quot; he demanded. &quot;I was
                        going to be a minister from long back of to-day, I guess. And I guess I said
                        I was going to be a minister right to-day before any of you said anything at
                        all. <hi rend="i">Didn&apos;t</hi> I, Herman? <hi rend="i">You</hi>
                        heard me, didn&apos;t you, Herman? That&apos;s the very thing
                        started you talking about it, wasn&apos;t it, Herman?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos; right,&quot; said Herman. &quot;You the
                        firs&apos; one to say it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Penrod, Sam, and Maurice immediately lost faith in Herman. They turned from
                        him and fell hotly upon Georgie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What if you did say it first?&quot; Penrod shouted.
                        &quot;You couldn&apos;t <hi rend="i">be</hi> a minister if you were
                        a hunderd years old!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I bet his mother wouldn&apos;t let him be one,&quot; said
                        Sam. &quot;She never lets him do anything.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She would, too,&quot; retorted Georgie. &quot;Ever since I
                        was little, she&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;s too sissy to be a preacher!&quot; cried Maurice.
                        &quot;Listen at his squeaky voice!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-305" n="297"/>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m going to be a better minister,&quot; shouted
                        Georgie, &quot;than all three of you put together. I could do it with my
                        left hand!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The three laughed bitingly in chorus. They jeered, derided, scoffed, and
                        raised an uproar which would have had its effect upon much stronger nerves
                        than Georgie&apos;s. For a time he contained his rising choler and
                        chanted monotonously, over and over; <hi rend="i">&quot;I could! I
                            could, too! I could! I could, too!&quot;</hi> But their tumult wore
                        upon him, and he decided to avail himself of the recent decision whereby a
                        big He was rendered innocuous and unprofane. Having used the expression
                        once, he found it comforting, and substituted it for: &quot;I could! I
                        could, too!&quot;</p>
                    <p>But it relieved him only temporarily. His tormentors were unaffected by it
                        and increased their howlings, until at last Georgie lost his head
                        altogether. Badgered beyond bearing, his eyes shining with a wild light, he
                        broke through the besieging trio, hurling little Maurice from his path with
                        a frantic hand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll show you!&quot; he cried, in this sudden frenzy.
                        &quot;You give me a chance, and I&apos;ll prove it right <hi
                            rend="i">now!&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s talkin&apos; business!&quot; shouted
                        Penrod.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Everybody keep still a minute. Everybody!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-306" n="298"/>
                    <p>He took command of the situation at once, displaying a fine capacity for
                        organization and system. It needed only a few minutes to set order in the
                        place of confusion and to determine, with the full concurrence of all
                        parties, the conditions under which Georgie Bassett was to defend his claim
                        by under-going what may be perhaps intelligibly defined as the Herman test.
                        Georgie declared he could do it easily. He was in a state of great
                        excitement and in no condition to think calmly or, probably, he would not
                        have made the attempt at all. Certainly he was overconfident.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="b">I</hi>T WAS during the discussion of the details of this
                        enterprise that Georgie&apos;s mother, a short distance down the street,
                        received a few female callers, who came by appointment to drink a glass of
                        iced tea with her, and to meet the Rev. Mr. Kinosling. Mr. Kinosling was
                        proving almost formidably interesting to the women and girls of his own and
                        other flocks. What favour of his fellow clergymen a slight precociousness of
                        manner and pronunciation cost him was more than balanced by the visible
                        ecstasies of ladies. They blossomed at his touch.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-308" n="300"/>
                    <p>He had just entered Mrs. Bassett&apos;s front door, when the son of the
                        house, followed by an intent and earnest company of four, opened the alley
                        gate and came into the yard. The unconscious Mrs. Bassett was about to have
                        her first experience of a fatal coincidence. It was her first, because she
                        was the mother of a boy so well behaved that he had become a proverb of
                        transcendency. Fatal coincidences were plentiful in the Schofield and
                        Williams families, and would have been familiar to Mrs. Bassett had Georgie
                        been permitted greater intimacy with Penrod and Sam.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Kinosling sipped his iced tea and looked about him approvingly. Seven
                        ladies leaned forward, for it was to be seen that he meant to speak.</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;This cool room is a relief,&quot; he said, waving a
                        graceful hand in a neatly limited gesture, which everybody&apos;s eyes
                        followed, his own included. &quot;It is a relief and a retreat. The
                        windows open, the blinds closedthat is as it should be. It is a retreat, a
                        fastness, a bastion against the heat&apos;s assault. For me, a quiet
                        rooma quiet room and a book, a volume in the hand, held lightly between the
                        fingers. A volume of poems, lines metrical and cadenced; something by a
                        sound Victorian. We have no later poets.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-309" n="301"/>
                    <p>&quot;Swinburne?&quot; suggested Miss Beam, an eager spinster.
                        &quot;Swinburne, Mr. Kinosling? Ah, <hi rend="i"
                        >Swinburne!&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>&quot;Not Swinburne,&quot; said Mr. Kinosling chastely.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>
                    <p>That concluded all the remarks about Swinburne.</p>
                    <p>Miss Beam retired in confusion behind another lady; and somehow there became
                        diffused an impression that Miss Beam was erotic.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I do not observe your manly little son,&quot; Mr. Kinosling
                        addressed his hostess.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;s out playing in the yard,&quot; Mrs. Bassett
                        returned. &quot;I heard his voice just now, I think.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Everywhere I hear wonderful report of him,&quot; said Mr.
                        Kinosling. &quot;I may say that I understand boys, and I feel that he is
                        a rare, a fine, a pure, a lofty spirit. I say spirit, for spirit is the word
                        I hear spoken of him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>A chorus of enthusiastic approbation affirmed the accuracy of this
                        proclamation, and Mrs. Bassett flushed with pleasure. Georgie&apos;s
                        spiritual perfection was demonstrated by instances of it, related by the
                        visitors; his piety was cited, and wonderful things he had said were quoted.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-310" n="302"/>
                    <p>&quot;Not all boys are pure, of fine spirit, of high mind,&quot; said
                        Mr. Kinosling, and continued with true feeling:</p>
                    <p>&quot;You have a neighbour, dear Mrs. Bassett, whose household I indeed
                        really feel it quite impossible to visit until such time when better,
                        firmer, stronger handed, more determined discipline shall prevail. I find
                        Mr. and Mrs. Schofield and their daughter charming&quot;</p>
                    <p>Three or four ladies said &quot;Oh!&quot; and spoke a name
                        simultaneously. It was as if they had said, &quot;Oh, the bubonic
                        plague!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh! Penrod Schofield!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Georgie does not play with him,&quot; said Mrs. Bassett
                        quickly&quot;that is, he avoids him as much as he can without hurting
                        Penrod&apos;s feelings. Georgie is very sensitive to giving pain. I
                        suppose a mother should not tell these things, and I know people who talk
                        about their own children are dreadful bores, but it was only last Thursday
                        night that Georgie looked up in my face so sweetly, after he had said his
                        prayers and his little cheeks flushed, as he said: &quot;Mamma, I think
                        it would be right for me to go more with Penrod. I think it would make him a
                        better boy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>A sibilance went about the room. &quot;Sweet! How sweet! The sweet little
                        soul! Ah, <hi rend="i">sweet!&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-311" n="303"/>
                    <p>&quot;And that very afternoon,&quot; continued Mrs. Bassett,
                        &quot;he had come home in a dreadful state. Penrod had thrown tar all
                        over him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Your son has a forgiving spirit!&quot; said Mr. Kinosling with
                        vehemence. &quot;A too forgiving spirit, perhaps.&quot; He set down
                        his glass. &quot;No more, I thank you. No more cake, I thank you. Was it
                        not Cardinal Newman who said&quot;</p>
                    <p>He was interrupted by the sounds of an altercation just outside the closed
                        blinds of the window nearest him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let him pick his tree!&quot; It was the voice of Samuel
                        Williams. &quot;Didn&apos;t we come over here to give him one of his
                        own trees? Give him a fair show, can&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The little lads!&quot; Mr. Kinosling smiled. &quot;They
                        have their games, their outdoor sports, their pastimes. The young muscles
                        are toughening. The sun will not harm them. They grow; they expand; they
                        learn. They learn fair play, honour, courtesy, from one another, as pebbles
                        grow round in the brook. They learn more from themselves than from us. They
                        take shape, form, outline. Let them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mr. Kinosling!&quot; Another spinsterundeterred by what had
                        happened to Miss Beamleaned far <pb id="VAA2383-312" n="304"/> forward, her
                        face shining and ardent. &quot;Mr. Kinosling, there&apos;s a
                        question I <hi rend="i">do</hi> wish to ask you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;My dear Miss Cosslit,&quot; Mr. Kinosling responded, again
                        waving his hand and watching it, &quot;I am entirely at your
                        disposal.&quot;</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">&quot;Was</hi> Joan of Arc,&quot; she asked fervently,
                        &quot;inspired by spirits?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He smiled indulgently. &quot;Yesand no,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;One must give both answers. One must give the answer, yes; one must
                        give the answer, no.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, <hi rend="i">thank</hi> you!&quot; said Miss Cosslit,
                        blushing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She&apos;s one of my great enthusiasms, you know.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And I have a question, too,&quot; urged Mrs. Lora Rewbush,
                        after a moment&apos;s hasty concentration.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve never been able to settle it for myself, but <hi
                            rend="i">now</hi>&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes?&quot; said Mr. Kinosling encouragingly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Isahisoh, yes: Is Sanskrit a more difficult language than Spanish,
                        Mr. Kinosling?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It depends upon the student,&quot; replied the oracle smiling.
                        &quot;One must not look for linguists everywhere. In my own especial
                        caseif one may cite one&apos;s self as an exampleI found no great, no
                        insurmountable difficulty in mastering, in conquering either.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-313" n="305"/>
                    <p>&quot;And may <hi rend="i">I</hi> ask one?&quot; ventured Mrs.
                        Bassett.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you think it is right to wear egrets?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;There are marks of quality, of caste, of social
                        distinction,&quot; Mr. Kinosling began, &quot;which must be
                        permitted, allowed, though perhaps regulated. Social distinction, one
                        observes, almost invariably implies spiritual distinction as well.
                        Distinction of circumstances is accompanied by mental distinction.
                        Distinction is hereditary; it descends from father to son, and if there is
                        one thing more true than &apos;Like father, like son,&apos; it
                        is&quot; he bowed gallantly to Mrs. Bassett&quot;It is,
                        &apos;Like mother, like son.&apos; What these good ladies have said
                        this afternoon of <hi rend="i">your</hi>&quot;</p>
                    <p>This was the fatal instant. There smote upon all ears the voice of Georgie,
                        painfully shrill and penetratingfraught with protest and protracted strain.
                        His plain words consisted of the newly sanctioned and disinfected curse with
                        a big H.</p>
                    <p>With an ejaculation of horror, Mrs. Bassett sprang to the window and threw
                        open the blinds.</p>
                    <p>Georgie&apos;s back was disclosed to the view of the tea-party. He was
                        endeavouring to ascend a maple tree about twelve feet from the window.
                        Embracing the trunk with arms and legs, he had managed <pb id="VAA2383-314"
                            n="306"/> to squirm to a point above the heads of Penrod and Herman, who
                        stood close by, watching him earnestlyPenrod being obviously in charge of
                        the performance. Across the yard were Sam Williams and Maurice Levy, acting
                        as a jury on the question of voice-power, and it was to a complaint of
                        theirs that Georgie had just replied.</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;That&apos;s right, Georgie,&quot; said Penrod
                        encouragingly. &quot;They can, too, hear you. Let her go!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Going to heaven!&quot; shrieked Georgie, squirming up another
                        inch. &quot;Going to heaven, heaven, heaven!&quot;</p>
                    <p>His mother&apos;s frenzied attempts to attract his attention failed
                        utterly. Georgie was using the full power of his lungs, deafening his own
                        ears to all other sounds. Mrs. Bassett called in vain; while the tea-party
                        stood petrified in a cluster about the window.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Going to heaven!&quot; Georgie bellowed. &quot;Going to
                        heaven! Going to heaven, my Lord! Going to heaven, heaven, heaven!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He tried to climb higher, but began to slip downward, his exertions causing
                        damage to his apparel.</p>
                    <p>A button flew into the air, and his knickerbockers and his waistband severed
                        relations.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Devil&apos;s got my coat-tails, sinners! Old devil&apos;s
                            <pb id="VAA2383-315" n="307"/> got my coat-tails!&quot; he announced
                        appropriately. Then he began to slide. He relaxed his clasp of the tree and
                        slid to the ground.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Going to hell!&quot; shrieked Georgie, reaching a high pitch of
                        enthusiasm in this great climax. &quot;Going to hell! Going to hell!
                        I&apos;m gone to hell, hell, hell!&quot;</p>
                    <p>With a loud scream, Mrs. Bassett threw herself out of the window, alighting
                        by some miracle upon her feet with ankles unsprained.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Kinosling, feeling that his presence as spiritual adviser was demanded in
                        the yard, followed with greater dignity through the front door. At the
                        corner of the house a small departing figure collided with him violently. It
                        was Penrod, tactfully withdrawing from what promised to be a family scene of
                        unusual painfulness.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Kinosling seized him by the shoulders and, giving way to emotion, shook
                        him viciously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You horrible boy!&quot; exclaimed Mr. Kinosling. &quot;You
                        ruffianly creature! Do you know what&apos;s going to happen to you when
                        you grow up? Do you realize what you&apos;re going to <hi rend="i"
                            >be!&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>With flashing eyes, the indignant boy made known his unshaken purpose. He
                        shouted the reply:</p>
                    <p>&quot;A minister!&quot;</p>

                        <hi rend="b">T</hi>HIS busy globe which spawns us is as incapable of
                        flattery and as intent upon its own affair, whatever that is, as a
                        gyroscope; it keeps steadily whirling along its lawful track, and, thus far
                        seeming to hold a right of way, spins doggedly on, with no perceptible
                        diminution of speed to mark the most gigantic human eventsit did not pause
                        to pant and recuperate even when what seemed to Penrose its principal
                        purpose was accomplished, and an enormous shadow, vanishing west-ward over
                        its surface, marked the dawn of his twelfth birthday.</p>
                    <p>To be twelve is an attainment worth the struggle.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-317" n="309"/>
                    <p>A boy, just twelve, is like a Frenchman just elected to the Academy.</p>
                    <p>Distinction and honour wait upon him. Younger boys show deference to a person
                        of twelve; his experience is guaranteed, his judgment, therefore, mellow;
                        consequently, his influence is profound. Eleven is not quite satisfactory:
                        it is only an approach. Eleven has the disadvantage of six, of nineteen, of
                        forty-four, and of sixty-nine. But, like twelve, seven is an honourable age,
                        and the ambition to attain it is laudable. People look forward to being
                        seven. Similarly, twenty is worthy, and so, arbitrarily, is twenty-one;
                        forty-five has great solidity; seventy is most commendable and each year
                        thereafter an increasing honour. Thirteen is embarrassed by the beginnings
                        of a new colthood; the child becomes a youth. But twelve is the very top of
                        boyhood.</p>
                    <p>Dressing, that morning, Penrod felt that the world was changed from the world
                        of yesterday. For one thing, he seemed to own more of it; this day was <hi
                            rend="i">his</hi> day. And it was a day worth owning; the midsummer
                        sunshine, pouring gold through his window, came from a cool sky, and a
                        breeze moved pleasantly in his hair as he leaned from the sill to watch the
                            <pb id="VAA2383-318" n="310"/> tribe of clattering blackbirds take wing,
                        following their leader from the trees in the yard to the day&apos;s work
                        in the open country. The blackbirds were his, as the sunshine and the breeze
                        were his, for they all belonged to the day which was his birthday and
                        therefore most surely his. Pride suffused him: he was twelve!</p>
                    <p>His father and his mother and Margaret seemed to understand the difference
                        between to-day and yesterday. They were at the table when he descended, and
                        they gave him a greeting which of itself marked the milestone. Habitually,
                        his entrance into a room where his elders sat brought a cloud of
                        apprehension: they were prone to look up in pathetic expectancy, as if their
                        thought was, &quot;What new awfulness is he going to start <hi rend="i"
                            >now?&quot;</hi> But this morning they laughed; his mother rose and
                        kissed him twelve times, so did Margaret; and his father shouted,
                        &quot;Well, well! How&apos;s the <hi rend="i">man?&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Then his mother gave him a Bible and &quot;The Vicar of
                        Wakefield&quot;; Margaret gave him a pair of silver-mounted hair
                        brushes; and his father gave him a &quot;Pocket Atlas&quot; and a
                        small compass.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And now, Penrod,&quot; said his mother, after breakfast,
                        &quot;I&apos;m going to take you out in the <pb id="VAA2383-319"
                            n="311"/> country to pay your birthday respects to Aunt Sarah
                        Crim.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Aunt Sarah Crim, Penrod&apos;s great-aunt, was his oldest living
                        relative. She was ninety, and when Mrs. Schofield and Penrod alighted from a
                        carriage at her gate they found her digging with a spade in the garden.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m glad you brought him,&quot; she said, desisting
                        from labour. &quot;Jinny&apos;s baking a cake I&apos;m going to
                        send for his birthday party. Bring him in the house.</p>
                    <p>I&apos;ve got something for him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She led the way to her &quot;sitting-room,&quot; which had a pleasant
                        smell, unlike any other smell, and, opening the drawer of a shining old
                        what-not, took therefrom a boy&apos;s &quot;sling-shot,&quot;
                        made of a forked stick, two strips of rubber and a bit of leather.</p>
                    <p>&quot;This isn&apos;t for you,&quot; she said, placing it in
                        Penrod&apos;s eager hand. &quot;No. It would break all to pieces the
                        first time you tried to shoot it, because it is thirty-five years old. I
                        want to send it back to your father. I think it&apos;s time. You give it
                        to him from me, and tell him I say I believe I can trust him with it now. I
                        took it away from him thirty-five years ago, one day after he&apos;d
                        killed my best hen with it, accidentally, and broken a glass pitcher on <pb
                            id="VAA2383-320" n="312"/> the back porch with itaccidentally. He
                        doesn&apos;t look like a person who&apos;s ever done things of that
                        sort, and I suppose he&apos;s forgotten it so well that he believes he
                        never <hi rend="i">did</hi>, but if you give it to him from me I think
                        he&apos;ll remember. You look like him, Penrod. He was anything but a
                        handsome boy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>After this final bit of reminiscenceprobably designed to be repeated to Mr.
                        Schofieldshe disappeared in the direction of the kitchen, and returned with
                        a pitcher of lemonade and a blue china dish sweetly freighted with flat
                        ginger cookies of a composition that was her own secret. Then, having set
                        this collation before her guests, she presented Penrod with a superb,
                        intricate, and very modern machine of destructive capacities almost
                        limitless. She called it a pocket-knife.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I suppose you&apos;ll do something horrible with it,&quot;
                        she said, composedly. &quot;I hear you do that with everything, anyhow,
                        so you might as well do it with this, and have more fun out of it. They tell
                        me you&apos;re the Worst Boy in Town.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, Aunt Sarah!&quot; Mrs. Schofield lifted a protesting hand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nonsense!&quot; said Mrs. Crim.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But on his birthday!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-321" n="313"/>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s the time to say it. Penrod, aren&apos;t you the
                        Worst Boy in Town?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Penrod, gazing fondly upon his knife and eating cookies rapidly, answered as
                        a matter of course, and absently, &quot;Yes&apos;m.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Certainly!&quot; said Mrs. Crim. &quot;Once you accept a
                        thing about yourself as established and settled, it&apos;s all right.
                        Nobody minds. Boys are just like people, really.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, no!&quot; Mrs. Schofield cried, involuntarily.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, they are,&quot; returned Aunt Sarah. &quot;Only
                        they&apos;re not quite so awful, because they haven&apos;t learned
                        to cover themselves all over with little pretences. When Penrod grows up
                        he&apos;ll be just the same as he is now, except that whenever he does
                        what he wants to do he&apos;ll tell himself and other people a little
                        story about it to make his reason for doing it seem nice and pretty and
                        noble.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, I won&apos;t!&quot; said Penrod suddenly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There&apos;s one cookie left,&quot; observed Aunt Sarah.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are you going to eat it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said her great-nephew, thoughtfully, &quot;I
                        guess I better.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why?&quot; asked the old lady. &quot;Why do you guess
                        you&apos;d &apos;better&apos;?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-322" n="314"/>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Penrod, with a full mouth, &quot;it might
                        get all dried up if nobody took it, and get thrown out and wasted.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re beginning finely,&quot; Mrs. Crim remarked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A year ago you&apos;d have taken the cookie without, the same
                        sense of thrift.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ma&apos;am?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nothing. I see that you&apos;re twelve years old,
                        that&apos;s all. There are more cookies, Penrod.&quot; She went
                        away, returning with a fresh supply and the observation, &quot;Of
                        course, you&apos;ll be sick before the day&apos;s over; you might as
                        well get a good start.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Schofield looked thoughtful. &quot;Aunt Sarah,&quot; she
                        ventured, &quot;don&apos;t you really think we improve as we get
                        older?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Meaning,&quot; said the old lady, &quot;that Penrod
                        hasn&apos;t much chance to escape the penitentiary if he
                        doesn&apos;t? Well, we do learn to restrain ourselves in some things;
                        and there are people who really want someone else to take the last cookie,
                        though they aren&apos;t very common. But it&apos;s all right, the
                        world seems to be getting on.&quot; She gazed whimsically upon her
                        great-nephew and added, &quot;Of course, when you watch a boy and think
                        about him, it doesn&apos;t seem to be getting on very fast.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-323" n="315"/>
                    <p>Penrod moved uneasily in his chair; he was conscious that he was her topic
                        but unable to make out whether or not her observations were complimentary;
                        he inclined to think they were not. Mrs. Crim settled the question for him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I suppose Penrod is regarded as the neighbour-hood curse?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, no,&quot; cried Mrs. Schofield. &quot;He&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I dare say the neighbours are right,&quot; continued the old
                        lady placidly. &quot;He&apos;s had to repeat the history of the race
                        and go through all the stages from the primordial to barbarism. You
                        don&apos;t expect boys to be civilized, do you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You might as well expect eggs to crow. No; you&apos;ve got to
                        take boys as they are, and learn to know them as they are.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Naturally, Aunt Sarah,&quot; said Mrs. Schofield, &quot;I
                            <hi rend="i">know</hi> Penrod.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Aunt Sarah laughed heartily. &quot;Do you think his father knows him,
                        too?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course, men are different,&quot; Mrs. Schofield returned,
                        apologetically. &quot;But a mother knows&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Penrod,&quot; said Aunt Sarah, solemnly, &quot;does your
                        father understand you?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-324" n="316"/>
                    <p>&quot;Ma&apos;am?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;About as much as he&apos;d understand Sitting Bull!&quot;
                        she laughed. &quot;And I&apos;ll tell you what your mother thinks
                        you are, Penrod. Her real belief is that you&apos;re a novice in a
                        convent.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ma&apos;am?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aunt Sarah!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know she thinks that, because whenever you don&apos;t behave
                        like a novice she&apos;s disappointed in you. And your father really
                        believes that you&apos;re a decorous, well-trained young business man,
                        and when-ever you don&apos;t live up to that standard you get on his
                        nerves and he thinks you need a walloping. I&apos;m sure a day very
                        seldom passes without their both saying they don&apos;t know what on
                        earth to do with you. Does whipping do you any good, Penrod?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ma&apos;am?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Go on and finish the lemonade; there&apos;s about a glassful
                        left. Oh, take it, take it; and don&apos;t say why! Of <hi rend="i"
                            >course</hi> you&apos;re a little pig.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Penrod laughed gratefully, his eyes fixed upon her over the rim of his
                        uptilted glass.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Fill yourself up uncomfortably,&quot; said the old lady.
                        &quot;You&apos;re twelve years old, and you ought to be happyif you
                        aren&apos;t anything else. It&apos;s <pb id="VAA2383-325" n="317"/>
                        taken over nineteen hundred years of Christianity and some hundreds of
                        thousands of years of other things to produce you, and there you
                        sit!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ma&apos;am?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;ll be your turn to struggle and muss things up for the
                        betterment of posterity, soon enough,&quot; said Aunt Sarah Crim.
                        &quot;Drink your lemonade!&quot;</p>

                        <hi rend="b">A</hi>UNT SARAH&apos;S a funny old lady,&quot; Penrod
                        observed, on the way back to the town. &quot;What&apos;s she want me
                        to give papa this old sling for? Last thing she said was to be sure not to
                        forget to give it to him. <hi rend="i">He</hi> don&apos;t want it; and
                        she said, herself, it ain&apos;t any good. She&apos;s older than you
                        or papa, isn&apos;t she?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;About fifty years older,&quot; answered Mrs. Schofield, turning
                        upon him a stare of perplexity. &quot;Don&apos;t cut into the
                        leather with your new knife, dear; the livery man might ask us to pay ifNo,
                        I wouldn&apos;t <pb id="VAA2383-327" n="319"/> scrape the paint off,
                        eithernor whittle your shoe with it. <hi rend="i">Couldn&apos;t</hi> you
                        put it up until we get home?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We goin&apos; straight home?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No. We&apos;re going to stop at Mrs. Gelbraith&apos;s and
                        ask a strange little girl to come to your party, this afternoon.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Her name is Fanchon. She&apos;s Mrs. Gelbraith&apos;s
                        little niece.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What makes her so queer?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I didn&apos;t say she&apos;s queer.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You said&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No; I mean that she is a stranger. She lives in New York and has
                        come to visit here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s she live in New York for?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Because her parents live there. You must be very nice to her,
                        Penrod; she has been very carefully brought up. Besides, she
                        doesn&apos;t know the children here, and you must help to keep her from
                        feeling lonely at your party.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes&apos;m.&quot;</p>
                    <p>When they reached Mrs. Gelbraith&apos;s, Penrod sat patiently humped upon
                        a gilt chair during the lengthy exchange of greetings between his mother and
                        Mrs. Gelbraith. That is one of the things a boy must <pb id="VAA2383-328"
                            n="320"/> learn to bear: when his mother meets a compeer there is always
                        a long and dreary wait for him, while the two appear to be using strange
                        symbols of speech, talking for the greater part, it seems to him,
                        simultaneously, and employing a wholly incomprehensible system of emphasis
                        at other times not in vogue. Penrod twisted his legs, his cap and his nose.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Here she is!&quot; Mrs. Gelbraith cried, unexpectedly, and a
                        dark-haired, demure person entered the room wearing a look of gracious
                        social expectancy. In years she was eleven, in manner about sixty-five, and
                        evidently had lived much at court. She performed a curtsey in acknowledgment
                        of Mrs. Schofield&apos;s greeting, and bestowed her hand upon Penrod,
                        who had entertained no hope of such an honour, showed his surprise that it
                        should come to him, and was plainly unable to decide what to do about it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Fanchon, dear,&quot; said Mrs. Gelbraith, &quot;take Penrod
                        out in the yard for a while, and play.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let go the little girl&apos;s hand, Penrod,&quot; Mrs.
                        Schofield laughed, as the children turned toward the door.</p>
                    <p>Penrod hastily dropped the small hand, and exclaiming, with simply honesty,
                        &quot;Why, <hi rend="i">I</hi> don&apos;t want it!&quot;
                        followed Fanchon out into the sunshiny yard, where they came to a halt and
                        surveyed each other.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-329" n="321"/>
                    <p>Penrod stared awkwardly at Fanchon, no other occupation suggesting itself to
                        him, while Fanchon, with the utmost coolness, made a very thorough visual
                        examination of Penrod, favouring him with an estimating scrutiny which
                        lasted until he literally wiggled. Finally, she spoke.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where do you buy your ties?&quot; she asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where do you buy your neckties? Papa gets his at Skoone&apos;s.
                        You ought to get yours there. I&apos;m sure the one you&apos;re
                        wearing isn&apos;t from Skoone&apos;s.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Skoone&apos;s?&quot; Penrod repeated.
                        &quot;Skoone&apos;s?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;On Fifth Avenue,&quot; said Fanchon. &quot;It&apos;s a
                        very smart shop, the men say.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Men?&quot; echoed Penrod, in a hazy whisper.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Men?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where do your people go in summer?&quot; inquired the lady. <hi
                            rend="i">&quot;We</hi> go to Long Shore, but so many middle-class
                        people have begun coming there, mamma thinks of leaving. The middle classes
                        are simply awful, don&apos;t you think?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;They&apos;re so boorjaw. You speak French, of course?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Me?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-330" n="322"/>
                    <p>&quot;We ran over to Paris last year. It&apos;s lovely,
                        don&apos;t you think? Don&apos;t you <hi rend="i">love</hi> the Rue
                        de la Paix?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Penrod wandered in a labyrinth. This girl seemed to be talking, but her words
                        were dumfounding, and of course there was no way for him to know that he was
                        really listening to her mother. It was his first meeting with one of those
                        grown-up little girls, wonderful product of the winter apartment and summer
                        hotel; and Fanchon, an only child, was a star of the brand. He began to feel
                        resentful.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I suppose,&quot; she went on, &quot;I&apos;ll find
                        everything here fearfully Western. Some nice people called yesterday,
                        though. Do you know the Magsworth Bittses? Auntie says they&apos;re
                        charming. Will Roddy be at your party?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I guess he will,&quot; returned Penrod, finding this
                        intelligible. &quot;The mutt!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Really!&quot; Fanchon exclaimed airily.
                        &quot;Aren&apos;t you great pals with him?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s &apos;pals&apos;?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good heavens! Don&apos;t you know what it means to say
                        you&apos;re &apos;great pals&apos; with any one? You <hi
                            rend="i">are</hi> an odd child!&quot;</p>
                    <p>It was too much.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, Bugs!&quot; said Penrod.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-331" n="323"/>
                    <p>This bit of ruffianism had a curious effect. Fanchon looked upon him with
                        sudden favour.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I like you, Penrod!&quot; she said, in an odd way, and,
                        whatever else there may have been in her manner, there certainly was no
                        shyness.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, Bugs!&quot; This repetition may have lacked gallantry, but
                        it was uttered in no very decided tone. Penrod was shaken.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I do!&quot; She stepped closer to him, smiling.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Your hair is ever so pretty.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Sailors&apos; parrots swear like mariners, they say; and gay mothers
                        ought to realize that all children are imitative, for, as the precocious
                        Fanchon leaned toward Penrod, the manner in which she looked into his eyes
                        might have made a thoughtful observer wonder where she had learned her
                        pretty ways.</p>
                    <p>Penrod was even more confused than he had been by her previous mysteries: but
                        his confusion was of a distinctly pleasant and alluring nature: he wanted
                        more of it. Looking intentionally into another person&apos;s eyes is an
                        act unknown to childhood; and Penrod&apos;s discovery that it could be
                        done was sensational. He had never thought of looking into the eyes of
                        Marjorie Jones.</p>
                    <p>Despite all anguish, contumely, tar, and Maurice <pb id="VAA2383-332" n="324"
                        /> Levy, he still secretly thought of Marjorie, with pathetic constancy, as
                        his &quot;beau&quot;though that is not how he would have spelled it.
                        Marjorie was beautiful; her curls were long and the colour of amber; her
                        nose was straight and her freckles were honest; she was much prettier than
                        this accomplished visitor. But beauty is not all.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I do!&quot; breathed Fanchon, softly.</p>
                    <p>She seemed to him a fairy creature from some rosier world than this. So
                        humble is the human heart, it glorifies and makes glamorous almost any poor
                        thing that says to it: &quot;I like you!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Penrod was enslaved. He swallowed, coughed, scratched the back of his neck,
                        and said, disjointedly:</p>
                    <p>&quot;WellI don&apos;t careif you want to. I just as soon.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We&apos;ll dance together,&quot; said Fanchon, &quot;at
                        your party.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I guess so. I just as soon.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t you want to, Penrod?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I&apos;m willing to.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No. Say you <hi rend="i">want</hi> to!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well&quot;</p>
                    <p>He used his toe as a gimlet, boring into the ground, his wide open eyes
                        staring with intense vacancy at <pb id="VAA2383-333" n="325"/> a button on
                        his sleeve. His mother appeared upon the porch in departure, calling
                        farewells over her shoulder to Mrs. Gelbraith, who stood in the doorway.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Say it!&quot; whispered Fanchon.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I just as <hi rend="i">soon.&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>She seemed satisfied.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="b">A</hi>DANCING floor had been laid upon a platform in the yard,
                        when Mrs. Schofield and her son arrived at their own abode; and a white and
                        scarlet striped canopy was in process of erection overhead, to shelter the
                        dancers from the sun. Workmen were busy everywhere under the direction of
                        Margaret, and the smitten heart of Penrod began to beat rapidly. All this
                        was for him; he was Twelve!</p>
                    <p>After lunch, he underwent an elaborate toilette and murmured not. For the
                        first time in his life <pb id="VAA2383-335" n="327"/> he knew the wish to be
                        sand-papered, waxed, and polished to the highest possible degree. And when
                        the operation was over, he stood before the mirror in new bloom, feeling
                        encouraged to hope that his resemblance to his father was not so strong as
                        Aunt Sarah seemed to think.</p>
                    <p>The white gloves upon his hands had a pleasant smell, he found; and, as he
                        came down the stairs, he had great content in the twinkling of his new
                        dancing slippers. He stepped twice on each step, the better to enjoy their
                        effect and at the same time he deeply inhaled the odour of the gloves. In
                        spite of everything, Penrod had his social capacities. Already it is to be
                        perceived that there were in him the makings of a cotillon leader.</p>
                    <p>Then came from the yard a sound of tuning instruments, squeak of fiddle,
                        croon of &apos;cello, a falling triangle ringing and tinkling to the
                        floor; and he turned pale.</p>
                    <p>Chosen guests began to arrive, while Penrod, suffering from stage-fright and
                        perspiration, stood beside his mother, in the
                        &quot;drawing-room,&quot; to receive them. He greeted unfamiliar
                        acquaintances and intimate fellow-criminals with the same frigidity,
                        murmuring: &quot; &apos;M glad to see y&apos;,&quot; to all
                        alike, <pb id="VAA2383-336" n="328"/> largely increasing the embarrassment
                        which always prevails at the beginning of children&apos;s festivities.
                        His unnatural pomp and circumstance had so thoroughly upset him, in truth,
                        that Marjorie Jones received a distinct shock, now to be related. Doctor
                        Thrope, the kind old clergyman who had baptized Penrod, came in for a moment
                        to congratulate the boy, and had just moved away when it was
                        Marjorie&apos;s turn, in the line of children, to speak to Penrod. She
                        gave him what she considered a forgiving look, and, because of the occasion,
                        addressed him in a perfectly courteous manner.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wish you many happy returns of the day, Penrod.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thank you, sir!&quot; he returned, following Dr. Thrope with a
                        glassy stare in which there was absolutely no recognition of Marjorie. Then
                        he greeted Maurice Levy, who was next to Marjorie: &quot; &apos;M
                        glad to see y&apos;!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Dumfounded, Marjorie turned aside, and stood near, observing Penrod with
                        gravity. It was the first great surprise of her life. Customarily, she had
                        seemed to place his character somewhere between that of the professional
                        rioter and that of the orangoutang; nevertheless, her manner at times just
                            <pb id="VAA2383-337" n="329"/> hinted a consciousness that this Caliban
                        was her property. Wherefore, she stared at him incredulously as his head
                        bobbed up and down, in the dancing-school bow, greeting his guests. Then she
                        heard an adult voice, near her, exclaim:</p>
                    <p>&quot;What an exquisite child!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Marjorie glanced upa little consciously, though she was used to itnaturally
                        curious to ascertain who was speaking of her. It was Sam Williams&apos;
                        mother addressing Mrs. Bassett, both being present to help Mrs. Schofield
                        make the festivities festive.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Exquisite!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Here was a second heavy surprise for Marjorie: they were not looking at her.
                        They were looking with beaming approval at a girl she had never seen; a dark
                        and modish stranger of singularly composed and yet modest aspect. Her
                        downcast eyes, becoming in one thus entering a crowded room, were all that
                        produced the effect of modesty, counteracting something about her which
                        might have seemed too assured. She was very slender, very dainty, and her
                        apparel was disheartening to the other girls; it was of a knowing
                        picturesqueness wholly unfamiliar to them. There was a delicate trace of
                        powder upon the lobe of Fanchon&apos;s left ear, <pb id="VAA2383-338"
                            n="330"/> and the outlines of her eyelids, if very closely scrutinized,
                        would have revealed successful experimentation with a burnt match.</p>
                    <p>Marjorie&apos;s lovely eyes dilated: she learned the meaning of hatred at
                        first sight. Observing the stranger with instinctive suspicion, all at once
                        she seemed, to herself, awkward. Poor Marjorie underwent that experience
                        which hearty, healthy, little girls and big girls undergo at one time or
                        anotherfrom heels to head she felt herself, somehow, too <hi rend="i"
                        >thick.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Fanchon leaned close to Penrod and whispered in his ear:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t you forget!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Penrod blushed.</p>
                    <p>Marjorie saw the blush. Her lovely eyes opened even wider, and in them there
                        began to grow a light. It was the light of indignation;at least, people
                        whose eyes glow with that light always call it indignation.</p>
                    <p>Roderick Magsworth Bitts, Junior, approached Fanchon, when she had made her
                        courtesy to Mrs. Schofield. Fanchon whispered in Roderick&apos;s ear
                        also.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Your hair <hi rend="i">is</hi> pretty, Roddy! Don&apos;t forget
                        what you said yesterday!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-339" n="331"/>
                    <p>Roderick likewise blushed.</p>
                    <p>Maurice Levy, captivated by the newcomer&apos;s appearance, pressed close
                        to Roderick.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Give us an intaduction, Roddy?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Roddy being either reluctant or unable to perform the rite, Fanchon took
                        matters into her own hands, and was presently favourably impressed with
                        Maurice, receiving the information that his tie had been brought to him by
                        his papa from Skoone&apos;s, where-upon she privately informed him that
                        she liked wavy bair, and arranged to dance with him. Fanchon also thought
                        sandy hair attractive, Sam Williams discovered, a few minutes later, and so
                        catholic was her taste that a ring of boys quite encircled her before the
                        musicians in the yard struck up their thrilling march, and Mrs. Schofield
                        brought Penrod to escort the lady from out-of-town to the dancing pavilion.</p>
                    <p>Headed by this pair, the children sought partners and paraded solemnly out of
                        the front door and round a corner of the house. There they found the gay
                        marquee; the small orchestra seated on the lawn at one side of it, and a
                        punch bowl of lemonade inviting attention, under a tree. Decorously the
                        small couples stepped upon the platform, one after another, and began to
                        dance.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-340" n="332"/>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s not much like a children&apos;s party in our
                        day,&quot; Mrs. Williams said to Penrod&apos;s mother.
                        &quot;We&apos;d have been playing
                        &apos;Quaker-meeting,&apos; &apos;Clap-in, Clap-out,&apos;
                        or &apos;Going to Jerusalem,&apos; I suppose.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, or &apos;Post-office&apos; and
                        &apos;Drop-the-handker-chief,&apos;&quot; said Mrs. Schofield.
                        &apos;Things change so quickly. Imagine asking little Fanchon Gelbraith
                        to play &apos;London Bridge&apos;! Penrod seems to be having a
                        difficult time with her, poor boy; he wasn&apos;t a shining light in the
                        dancing class.&quot;</p>
                    <p>However, Penrod&apos;s difficulty was not precisely of the kind his
                        mother supposed. Fanchon was showing him a new step, which she taught her
                        next partner in turn, continuing instructions during the dancing. The
                        children crowded the floor, and in the kaleidoscopic jumble of bobbing heads
                        and intermingling figures her extremely different style of motion was
                        unobserved by the older people, who looked on, nodding time benevolently.</p>
                    <p>Fanchon fascinated girls as well as boys. Many of the former eagerly sought
                        her acquaintance and thronged about her between the dances, when, accepting
                        the deference due a cosmopolitan and an oracle of the mode, she gave
                        demonstrations of the new step to succeeding groups, professing astonishment
                            <pb id="VAA2383-341" n="333"/> to find it unknown: it had been
                        &quot;all the go,&quot; she explained, at the Long Shore Casino for
                        fully two seasons. She pronounced &quot;slow&quot; a &quot;Fancy
                        Dance&quot; executed during an intermission by Baby Rennsdale and
                        Georgie Bassett, giving it as her opinion that Miss Rennsdale and Mr.
                        Bassett were &quot;dead ones&quot;; and she expressed surprise that
                        the punch bowl contained lemonade and not champagne.</p>
                    <p>The dancing continued, the new step gaining instantly in popularity, fresh
                        couples adventuring with every number. The word &quot;step&quot; is
                        somewhat misleading, nothing done with the feet being vital to the
                        evolutions introduced by Fanchon. <unclear>Fanchon-</unclear> dance came
                        from the Orient by a roundabout way, pausing in Spain, taking on a Gallic
                        frankness in gallantry at the Bal Bullier in Paris, combining with a
                        relative from the South Seas encountered in San Francisco, flavouring itself
                        with a carefree negroid abandon in New Orleans, and, accumulating, too,
                        something inexpressible from Mexico and South America, it kept, throughout
                        its travels, to the underworld, or to circles where nature is extremely
                        frank and rank, until at last it reached the dives of New York, when it
                        immediately broke out in what is called civilized society. Thereafter it
                        spread, in <pb id="VAA2383-342" n="334"/> variously modified formssome of
                        them disinfectedto watering-places, and thence, carried by hundreds of older
                        male and female Fanchons, over the country, being eagerly adopted everywhere
                        and made wholly pure and respectable by the supreme moral axiom that
                        anything is all right if enough people do it. Everybody was doing it.</p>
                    <p>Not quite everybody. It was perhaps some test of this dance that earth could
                        furnish no more grotesque sight than that of children doing it.</p>
                    <p>Earth, assisted by Fanchon, was furnishing this sight at Penrod&apos;s
                        party. By the time ice-cream and cake arrived, about half the guests had
                        either been initiated into the mysteries by Fanchon or were learning by
                        imitation, and the education of the other half was resumed with the dancing,
                        when the attendant ladies, unconscious of what was happening, withdrew into
                        the house for tea.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That orchestra&apos;s a dead one,&quot; Fanchon remarked to
                        Penrod. &quot;We ought to liven them up a little!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She approached the musicians.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t you know,&quot; she asked the leader,
                        &quot;the Slingo Sligo Slide?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The leader giggled, nodded, rapped with his bow upon his violin; and Penrod,
                        following Fanchon back <pb id="VAA2383-343" n="335"/> upon the dancing
                        floor, blindly brushed with his elbow a solitary little figure standing
                        aloof on the lawn at the edge of the platform.</p>
                    <p>It was Marjorie.</p>
                    <p>In no mood to approve of anything introduced by Fanchon, she had scornfully
                        refused, from the first, to dance the new &quot;step,&quot; and,
                        because of its bonfire popularity, found herself neglected in a society
                        where she had reigned as beauty and belle. Faithless Penrod, dazed by the
                        sweeping Fanchon, had utterly forgotten the amber curls; he had not once
                        asked Marjorie to dance. All afternoon the light of indignation had been
                        growing brighter in her eyes, though Maurice Levy&apos;s defection to
                        the lady from New York had not fanned this flame. From the moment Fanchon
                        had whispered familiarly in Penrod&apos;s ear, and Penrod had blushed,
                        Marjorie had been occupied exclusively with resentment against that guilty
                        pair. It seemed to her that Penrod had no right to allow a strange girl to
                        whisper in his ear; that his blushing, when the strange girl did it, was
                        atrocious; and that the strange girl, herself, ought to be arrested.</p>
                    <p>Forgotten by the merrymakers, Marjorie stood alone upon the lawn, clenching
                        her small fists, watching <pb id="VAA2383-344" n="336"/> the new dance at
                        its high tide, and hating it with a hatred that made every inch of her
                        tremble. And, perhaps because jealousy is a great awakener of the virtues,
                        she had a perception of something in it worse than lack of dignitysomething
                        vaguely but outrageously reprehensible. Finally, when Penrod brushed by her,
                        touched her with his elbow, and did not even see her, Marjorie&apos;s
                        state of mind (not unmingled with emotion!) became dangerous. In fact, a
                        trained nurse, chancing to observe her at this juncture, would probably have
                        advised that she be taken home and put to bed. Marjorie was on the verge of
                        hysterics.</p>
                    <p>She saw Fanchon and Penrod assume the double embrace required by the dance;
                        the &quot;Slingo Sligo Slide&quot; burst from the orchestra like the
                        lunatic shriek of a gin-maddened nigger; and all the little couples began to
                        bob and dip and sway.</p>
                    <p>Marjorie made a scene. She sprang upon the platform and stamped her foot.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Penrod Schofield!&quot; she shouted. &quot;You BEHAVE
                        yourself!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The remarkable girl took Penrod by the ear. By his ear she swung him away
                        from Fanchon and faced him toward the lawn.</p>

                    <p>&quot;You march straight out of here!&quot; she commanded.</p>
                    <p>Penrod marched.</p>
                    <p>He was stunned; obeyed automatically, without question, and had very little
                        realization of what was happening to him. Altogether, and without reason, he
                        was in precisely the condition of an elderly spouse detected in flagrant
                        misbehaviour. Marjorie, similarly, was in precisely the condition of the
                        party who detects such misbehaviour. It may be added that she had acted with
                        a promptness, a decision and a disregard of social consequences all to be
                        commended to the attention of ladies in like predicament.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You ought to be ashamed of yourself!&quot; she raged, when they
                        reached the lawn. &quot;Aren&apos;t you ashamed of
                        yourself?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What for?&quot; he inquired, helplessly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You be quiet!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But what&apos;d <hi rend="i">I</hi> do, Marjorie? <hi rend="i"
                            >I</hi> haven&apos;t done anything to you,&quot; he pleaded.
                        &quot;I haven&apos;t even seen you, all aftern&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You be quiet!&quot; she cried, tears filling her eyes.
                        &quot;Keep still! You ugly boy! Shut <hi rend="i">up</hi>!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She slapped him.</p>
                    <p>He should have understood from this how much <pb id="VAA2383-347" n="339"/>
                        she cared for him. But he rubbed his cheek and declared ruefully:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll never speak to you again!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You will, too!&quot; she sobbed, passionately.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I will not!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He turned to leave her, but paused.</p>
                    <p>His mother, his sister Margaret, and their grownup friends had finished their
                        tea and were approaching from the house. Other parents and guardians were
                        with them, coming for their children; and there were carriages and
                        automobiles waiting in the street. But the &quot;Slingo Slide&quot;
                        went on, regardless.</p>
                    <p>The group of grown-up people hesitated and came to a halt, gazing at the
                        pavilion.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What are they doing?&quot; gasped Mrs. Williams, blushing
                        deeply. &quot;What is it? What <hi rend="i">is</hi> it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">What is it</hi>?&quot; Mrs. Gelbraith echoed in a
                        frightened whisper. &quot;<hi rend="i">What</hi>&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;They&apos;re Tangoing!&quot; cried Margaret Schofield.
                        &quot;Or Bunny Hugging or Grizzly Bearing, or&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;They&apos;re only Turkey Trotting,&quot; said Robert
                        Williams.</p>
                    <p>With fearful outcries the mothers, aunts, and sisters rushed upon the
                        pavilion.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-348" n="340"/>
                    <p>&quot;Of course it was dreadful,&quot; said Mrs. Schofield, an hour
                        later, rendering her lord an account of the day, &quot;but it was every
                        bit the fault of that one extraordinary child. And of all the quiet, demure
                        little thingsthat is, I mean, when she first came. We all spoke of how
                        exquisite she seemedso well trained, so finished! Eleven years old! I never
                        saw anything like her in my life!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I suppose it&apos;s the New Child,&quot; her husband
                        grunted.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And to think of her saying there ought to have been champagne in
                        the lemonade!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Probably she&apos;d forgotten to bring her pocket
                        flask,&quot; he suggested musingly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But aren&apos;t you proud of Penrod?&quot; cried
                        Penrod&apos;s mother. &quot;It was just as I told you: he was
                        standing clear outside the pavilion&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I never thought to see the day! And Penrod was the only boy not
                        doing it, the only one to refuse? <hi rend="i">All</hi> the others
                        were&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Every one!&quot; she returned triumphantly. &quot;Even
                        Georgie Bassett!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Mr. Schofield, patting her on the shoulder,
                        &quot;I guess we can hold up our heads at last.&quot;</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="b">P</hi>ENROD was out in the yard, staring at the empty marquee.
                        The sun was on the horizon line, so far behind the back fence, and a western
                        window of the house blazed in gold unbearable to the eye: his day was nearly
                        over. He sighed, and took from the inside pocket of his new jacket the
                        &quot;sling-shot&quot; aunt Sarah Crim had given him that morning.</p>
                    <p>He snapped the rubbers absently. They held fast; and his next impulse was
                        entirely irresistible. He found a shapely stone, fitted it to the leather,
                            <pb id="VAA2383-350" n="342"/> and drew back the ancient catapult for a
                        shot. A sparrow hopped upon a branch between him and the house, and he aimed
                        at the sparrow, but the reflection from the dazzling window struck in his
                        eyes as he loosed the leather.</p>
                    <p>He missed the sparrow, but not the window. There was a loud crash, and to his
                        horror he caught a glimpse of his father, stricken in mid-shaving, ducking a
                        shower of broken glass, glittering razor flourishing wildly. Words crashed
                        with the glass, stentorian words, fragmentary but colossal.</p>
                    <p>Penrod stood petrified, a broken sling in his hand. He could hear his
                        parent&apos;s booming descent of the back stairs, instant and furious;
                        and then, red-hot above white lather, Mr. Schofield burst out of the kitchen
                        door and hurtled forth upon his son.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; he demanded, shaking Penrod by the
                        shoulder. &quot;Ten minutes ago, for the very first time in our lives,
                        your mother and I were saying we were proud of you, and here you go and
                        throw a rock at me through the window when I&apos;m shaving for
                        dinner!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I didn&apos;t!&quot; Penrod quavered. &quot;I was
                        shooting at a sparrow, and the sun got in my eyes, and the sling
                        broke&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-351" n="343"/>
                    <p>&quot;What sling?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;This&apos;n.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where&apos;d you get that devilish thing? Don&apos;t you
                        know I&apos;ve forbidden you a thousand times&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It ain&apos;t mine,&quot; said Penrod.
                        &quot;It&apos;s yours.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; said the boy meekly. &quot;Aunt Sarah Crim
                        gave it to me this morning and told me to give it back to you. She said she
                        took it away from you thirty-five years ago. You killed her hen, she said.
                        She told me some more to tell you, but I&apos;ve forgotten.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh!&quot; said Mr. Schofield.</p>
                    <p>He took the broken sling in his hand, looked at it long and thoughtfullyand
                        he looked longer, and quite as thoughtfully, at Penrod. Then he turned away,
                        and walked toward the house.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m sorry, papa,&quot; said Penrod.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Schofield coughed, and, as he reached the door, called back, but without
                        turning his head.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Never mind, little boy. A broken window isn&apos;t much
                        harm.&quot;</p>
                    <p>When he had gone in, Penrod wandered down the yard to the back fence, climbed
                        upon it, and sat in reverie there.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-352" n="344"/>
                    <p>A slight figure appeared, likewise upon a fence, beyond two neighbouring
                        yards.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yay, Penrod!&quot; called comrade Sam Williams.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yay!&quot; returned Penrod, mechanically.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I caught Billy Blue Hill!&quot; shouted Sam, describing
                        retribution in a manner perfectly clear to his friend. &quot;You were
                        mighty lucky to get out of it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know that!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You wouldn&apos;t of, if it hadn&apos;t been for
                        Marjorie.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, don&apos;t I know that?&quot; Penrod shouted, with
                        heat.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, so long!&quot; called Sam, dropping from his fence; and
                        the friendly voice came then, more faintly, &quot;Many happy returns of
                        the day, Penrod!&quot;</p>
                    <p>And now, a plaintive little whine sounded from below Penrod&apos;s feet,
                        and, looking down, he saw that Duke, his wistful, old, scraggly dog sat in
                        the grass, gazing seekingly up at him.</p>
                    <p>The last shaft of sunshine of that day fell graciously and like a blessing
                        upon the boy sitting on the fence. Years afterward, a quiet sunset would
                        recall to him sometimes the gentle evening of his twelfth birthday, and
                        bring him the picture of his boy self, sitting in rosy light upon the fence,
                        gazing pensively down upon his wistful, scraggly, little old dog, Duke. <pb

                        remember of that hour, for, in the side street, close by, a pink skirt
                        flickered from behind a shade tree to the shelter of the fence, there was a
                        gleam of amber curls, and Penrod started, as something like a tiny white
                        wing fluttered by his head, and there came to his ears the sound of a light
                        laugh and of light footsteps departing, the laughter tremulous, the
                        footsteps fleet.</p>
                    <p>In the grass, between Duke&apos;s forepaws, there lay a white note,
                        folded in the shape of a cocked hat, and the sun sent forth a final amazing
                        glory as Penrod opened it and read:</p>

                <byline>By ASA DON DICKINSON</byline>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="b">M</hi>ARK TWAIN&apos;S wife called him
                    &quot;Youth.&quot; And it would not be surprising if Booth
                    Tarkington&apos;s intimates had hit upon the same name, for it is to youth
                    that we look for vivacity, the spirit of good fellowship, and a loving
                    appreciation of the fine flower of romancethe ebullient qualities most
                    characteristic of Mr. Tarkington&apos;s personality.</p>
                <p>He was born several years ago in Indianapolis and began to dictate stories to a
                    long-suffering sister before he could write himself. Two enthusiasms seized him
                    at about the same timeone for Jesse James the outlaw, the other for G. P. R.
                    James the novelist. Perhaps the two were blended into one in the boy&apos;s
                    eager mind. At any rate, there were desperate robber plays in the barn and the
                    first pages of many tales of blood were written, and they always began,
                    &quot;It was dusk and four horsemen were seen riding over the top of the
                    hill.&quot;</p>
                <p>From early boyhood he enjoyed close friendship with his fellow-townsmen, James
                    Whitcomb Riley and Meredith Nicholson, and we can imagine the reverence with
                    which the youth with literary aspirations regarded the poet-friend of twice his
                    years whose fame <pb id="VAA2383-355" n="2"/> was already secure. Their long
                    walks togetherthe junior listening with rapt attention to the senior&apos;s
                    &quot;moonings&quot;surely had momentous consequences unconnected with
                    the appalling midnight lunches of pie, watermelon, strong coffee and Welsh
                    rarebits which marked the termination of these rambles.</p>
                <p>In due time Tarkington attended Phillips Exeter Academy, and began his college
                    career at Purdue University, like a good Indianian. At the beginning of the
                    Junior year he entered Princeton and then began what he would probably still
                    describe as the happiest and most successful years of his life. He assures us
                    that he studied some and we must believe him, for he stood well in his class.
                    But how in the world did he manage it? He filled a prominent place in so many
                    lines of student activity that we wonder where he found time for even casual
                    attention to the curriculum. He wrote, he drew, he sang, he composed music, he
                    acted. This man from the dead levels of a Middle Western state took to every
                    form of artistic expression as a duck takes to water. In attempting to explain
                    his varied talents, his relationship to the famous Booth family of actors has
                    been recalled; and a purely imaginary Gallic strain in his ancestry has been
                    invented.</p>
                <p>On being asked, what Princeton gave him, he replies, &quot;Some happy years
                    and recollectionsan uninterrupted affection for and interest in classmates and
                    friends. Princeton becomes part of the life of her sons. Also I have no doubt
                    that I imbibed some education there. Though it seems to me that I <hi rend="i"
                        >tried</hi> to avoid <hi rend="i">that</hi> as much as possible.&quot;</p>
                <p>He might have been forgiven if talent so universal <pb id="VAA2383-356" n="3"/>
                    had resulted in the self-conceit to which the college youth is sometimes
                    subject, but his popularity among his fellows is ample evidence that envy was
                    disarmed by modesty, as in the case of &quot;The Great Harkless,&quot;
                    in &quot;The Gentleman from Indiana.&quot;</p>
                <p>His classmates tell us that when the Seniors gathered on the steps of Nassau
                    Hall, in the long twilights of the spring days, there were always cries for
                    &quot;Tark&quot; and &quot;Danny Deever,&quot; the song he had
                    made his own. He would try desperately to keep out of sight and enjoy the
                    singing of the others. But it was no use. &quot;Tark&quot; always had to
                    do his stunt sooner or later and his song marked the climax of the evening.</p>
                <p>This modesty never forsook him, even after he had definitely arrived as a
                    successful author. As witness, the following &quot;Rondel&quot; which
                    hangs to-day on the wall of the Princeton Club, in New York City, beside a
                    portrait sketch of him standing beside the piano.</p>

                <p>Bright college years must pass at last, and soon after his graduation he returned
                    to Indianapolis to engage in his real life work, which his inability to take
                    himself with absolute seriousness makes him describe as
                    &quot;fussin&apos; with literachoor.&quot; But it is very plain that
                    his work was no joke to him, for he says, &quot;Writing is a trade, and,
                    like any other trade, it must be learned. We must serve our apprenticeship; but
                    we must work it out alone. There are no teachers. We must learn by failure and
                    by repeated efforts how the thing should be done. . . I always wrotesomehow and
                    any-howbut I wanted to be an illustrator; that is, I <hi rend="i">thought</hi> I
                    did. In &apos;95 I got a pen drawing in <hi rend="i">Life</hi> and thought
                    my start had come. Then <hi rend="i">Life</hi> rejected 31 subsequent drawings
                    and I kept on writing and quit drawing.&quot;</p>
                <p>These were indeed days and years of trial, and a mere shallow dillettantism might
                    have been expected from a brilliant young man, on whom rested no necessity of
                    earning his bread and butter. But as old Tom Martin of Plattville might say,
                    &quot;he had sand in his craw&quot; and he kept on writing and
                    re-writing sundry stories which he tells us were &quot;rejected every time
                    and for eight years&quot;! With cheerful candor, he has confessed that the
                    gross return from his first five years of work was exactly $22.50.</p>
                <p>At length the editor of a magazine took a fancy to &quot;Cherry&quot; and
                    accepted it. But he lacked the courage of his conviction and the manuscript
                    languished in his drawer till &quot;Monsieur Beaucaire&quot; appeared in
                        <hi rend="i">McClure&apos;s Magazine.</hi> This gem was a sensational
                    success and immediately won careful consideration <pb id="VAA2383-358" n="5"/>
                    <figure entity="VAA2383-13">
                        <p>From drawing by Booth Tarkington, illustrating his play &quot;The
                            Kisses of Marjorie&quot;</p>
                    </figure>
                    <pb id="VAA2383-359" n="6"/> and, consequently, publication for &quot;The
                    Gentleman from Indiana.&quot; It also speedily delivered
                    &quot;Cherry&quot; from its limbo of obscurity.</p>
                <p>Mr. Tarkington had arrived! And it is safe to say his acquaintanceship with
                    &quot;rejection slips&quot; came to a permanent end then and there.</p>
                <p>In telling how his first full-sized book came to be written, he says:
                    &quot;I&apos;d been writing short stories until I thought I might
                    venture a bigger jobso I did. All the short stories, including
                    &apos;Monsieur Beaucaire,&apos; had been rejected by several magazines,
                    and I had no idea that the novel would get into print. Of course, I <hi rend="i"
                        >hoped</hi> it might. I&apos;d have written it just the same if
                    I&apos;d been sure it wouldn&apos;t. Mr. McClure took it. It was
                    &apos;The Gentleman from Indiana.&apos;&quot;</p>
                <p>With characteristic loyalty he adds, &quot;I had no real success until I
                    struck Indiana subjects.&quot; He is an Indianian first of all and the rest
                    of us Americans can be thankful that, Indiana being so typical a state, the life
                    he has chosen to depict expresses so adequately the life of the country at
                    large.</p>
                <p>He was once elected to the legislature as a Republican, but speedily became an
                    insurgent. Many are the tales that are told about the political campaigning into
                    which he plunged with boyish zest. Here is one echo of those stirring days which
                    he repeats himself with great gusto:</p>
                <lg>
                    <l n="1">&quot;Going to vote for Tarkington?&quot;</l>
                    <l n="1">&quot;That actor fellow?&quot;</l>
                    <l n="1">&quot;Yes, that acrobat.&quot;</l>
                    <l n="1">&quot;Sure, I&apos;m goin&apos; to vote fer him.
                        Jes&apos; wanter sea what the <unclear>du--</unclear> fool&apos;l
                        do!&quot;</l>
                </lg>
                <pb id="VAA2383-360" n="7"/>
                <p>There is another story about a gorgeous waistcoat, and electioneering in a piano
                    factory. But as the joke was on the other fellow in this case, Tarkington is
                    tired of it. Then there is that shabby old veteran, the &quot;Doughnut
                    Story.&quot; But no wise man has told that in his presence for years. He is
                    a patient man, but constant dropping will wear away the stone and even the worm
                    will turn. Few are they who care to invite the shafts of Tarkington&apos;s
                    wit.</p>
                <p>Indianapolis is not the whole world to Tarkington, and though he probably thinks
                    it the best city in which to live, he prefers the country. In fact he finds
                    country life so alluring that he has to do nearly all his <hi rend="i">work</hi>
                    in towns. He has spent years in New York and says he knows &quot;very little
                    about even one bit of it.&quot; He likes Rome, Naples, the Island of Capri,
                    and, as might be expected, Paris, most of all. For he is surely part Frenchman
                    himself, as is witnessed by the gay vivacity of his temperament and his love for
                    the picturesque days of the <hi rend="i">ancien rgime.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>It is interesting to note that of thirteen favorite authors which he names, no
                    less than four are Frenchmen: Cherbuliez, Daudet, Balzac and Dumas. He reads
                    more autobiography, preferably French, than anything else. Of English authors,
                    he prefers Meredith, Stevenson, James, Wells, Bennett and Hardy; and Bennett is
                    a close personal friend. Among his compatriots he greatly admires the work of
                    Mark Twain, Howells, and Riley; and confesses a special fondness for
                    &quot;The Boss of Little Arcady,&quot; by his friend, Harry Leon Wilson.</p>
                <p>He has literary aversions too in plenty, and finds it <pb id="VAA2383-361" n="8"
                    /> hard to particularize in so wide a field. He says, &quot;Perhaps I most
                    hate the kind of &apos;literary thinking&apos; which would hold the
                    whole of the &apos;Iliad,&apos; for instance, to be literaturethe kind
                    of literary thinking which accepts the Classics as sacred and unassailable.
                    After that, I hate the sentimentalists, the intensists, and the baby-talk
                    school.&quot;</p>
                <p>The critics have babbled a great deal as to his own proper <hi rend="i"
                    >mtier</hi>, and most of them have advised him to stick to romanticism. But he
                    refuses to pigeonhole or be pigeonholed, and maintains that the only thing worth
                    considering is <hi rend="i">how a book is written.</hi> He says, &quot;I
                    don&apos;t care to what so-called class it is considered to belong. But, as
                    a matter of fact, most &apos;romanticism&apos; is of very inferior
                    workmanship, nowadays. The best men don&apos;t seem interested to do
                    it.&quot; (Lovers of Beaucaire fervently hope that the last of these
                    sentences applies to Mr. Tarkington as little as does the one which precedes
                    it!)</p>
                <p>There isn&apos;t much &quot;art&quot; in American writing just now,
                    he thinks. &quot;The greatest figure in prose (Mark Twain) has gone. Mr.
                    Howells has not been publishing a great deal. Mr. Riley has been quiet: the new
                    figures have not emerged clearly. Doubtless they will as time goes on.&quot;
                    But nevertheless he believes that <hi rend="i">better writing</hi> is being done
                    to-day than ever before. He expects American fiction to become in time wholly
                    &quot;un-&apos;Mediterranean&apos;: Studies of our people in
                        <unclear>th-</unclear> language of the people.&quot;</p>
                <p>When asked what he thinks about the promise of the new men, he says,
                    &quot;No. I don&apos;t see any rising stars. There are probably some
                    artists who will in, <pb id="VAA2383-362" n="9"/>
                    <figure entity="VAA2383-14">
                        <p>THIS CUT NEEDS NO EXPLANATION</p>
                    </figure> time prove themselves to be artists. There are Americans who can
                    write. Nobody is a star until he is deada long time dead. If he&apos;s
                    starry too soon, usually he doesn&apos;t remain so. If you press me, I
                    should have to say that I consider the most interesting phenomenon in modern
                    literature to be its modernism. I don&apos;t know exactly what I mean by
                    that, but it sounds as if it meant somethingand it does.&quot;</p>
                <p>It is significant that he considers Joseph Conrad &quot;A <pb
                        id="VAA2383-363" n="10"/> very big mana wonderful man. He has a wonderful
                    vision and gives it to us in a strange way that is full of beauty.&quot;</p>
                <p>When one mentions Conrad, one thinks of open water, so it may as well be said
                    here that Tarkington has become an enthusiastic motor boatman. He has traded his
                    old twenty-foot dory for a thirty-footer and is enjoying &quot;mild and
                    slow&quot; cruising. He has had a number of automobiles at home and abroad,
                    but they are now banished and he expects to spend most of his spare time on the
                    water henceforth. He has never been personally active in outdoor games, though
                    he loyally supported athletics at college and he still usually gets to Princeton
                    in the autumn for some of the football.</p>
                <p>The average man is always interested to know how the genius does it. Mr.
                    Tarkington rises at nine and is hard at it in a bath-robe at nine-thirty. He
                    continues with as little food as possible, until evening. And sometimes he works
                    eighteen hours at a stretchoften till after midnight. At any rate there is work
                    every day till the tasknovel, short story or playis done. It is a relief to know
                    that there are vacations between these periods of feverish activity. He
                    corroborates the word of other novelist-dramatists when he says that the <hi
                        rend="i">writing</hi> of a play is comparatively easy.
                    But&quot;&apos;putting it on&apos; is another matter.&quot; And
                    fiction, he feels, is his work. To know one&apos;s work, and how to do it,
                    is surely the greatest of all satisfactions. Mr. Tarkington is to be
                    congratulated.</p>
