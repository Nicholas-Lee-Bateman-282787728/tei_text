            A friend or two
                
                    
                    
                    
                    There's all of pleasure and all of peace;
                    In a friend or two;
                    And all your troubles may find release
                    With a friend or two;
                    It's in the grip of the clasping hand
                    On native soil or in alien land,
                    But the world is made-- do you understand?--
                    Of a friend or two.
                
                
                
                
                    
                    
                    
                    A song to sinq and a crust to share
                    With a friend or two;
                    A smile to give and a qrief to bear
                    With a friend or two;
                    A road to walk and a goal to win,
                    An inglenook to find comfort in,
                    The gladdest hours that we know, begin
                    With a friend or two.
                
                
                
                
                    
                    
                    
                    A little laughter; perhaps some tears
                    With a friend or two;
                    The days, the weeks, and the months and years
                    With a friend or two;
                    A vale to cross and a hill to climb,
                    A mock at and and a jeer at time--
                    The prose of life takes the lilt of rhyme
                    With a friend or two.
                
                
                
                
                    
                    
                    
                    The brother=soul and the brother=heart
                    Of a friend or two
                    Make us drift on from the crowd apart
                    With a friend or two;
                    For come days happy or come days sad
                    We count no hours but the ones made glad
                    By the hale qood times we have ever had
                    With a friend or two.
                
                
                
                
                    
                    
                    
                    Then brim the goblet and quaff the toast
                    To a friend or two,
                    For glad the man who can always boast
                    Of a friend or two;
                    The fairest siqht is a friendly face,
                    The blithest tread is a friendly pace,
                    And heaven will be a better place
                    For a friend or two.
