                    Harris-burg. His early departure was in response to an urgent appeal from one of his henchmen who

            <p>Weed's opposition to the Mill Boy's candidacy was prompted largely by political
                    expediency. To Weed, politics was the science of the possible and availability was his basic axiom.
                    In choosing his presidential favorite, he hoped to please a diverse and conglomerate army of
                    abolitionists, anti-Masons, and National Republicans in western <placeName>

                    the Whig party, when he asked: "Into what crucible can we throw this heterogeneous mass

                    General William Henry Harrison, whose opinions were sufficiently ambiguous to permit the kind of

            <p>As the campaign reached its climax, the executive committee issued a directive to the
                    "Central Whig Committee" of each county in the country. In addition to the usual
                    last-minute exhortations, the directive contained specific advice for the final phases of the
                    canvass. It was, in a sense, a testimonial to the meticulous nature of the Whig organization.
                    Complete poll lists were urged for each precinct, with voters listed as "good, bad, or
                    doubtful." Vigilance committees were suggested to persuade doubtful voters and to get out
                    the vote. Conveyances were to be furnished the aged and infirm. "Urge every friend of
                    Republican Institutions to go to the polls," said the directive; "not one vote
                    should be lost." Then, in a final admonition mailed to every precinct committeeman, the
                    executive committee concluded, "Let us entreat you, as you value your rights and liberties,
                    to lose no time in effecting … [these measures for victory."<hi rend="sup">16</hi>

            <p>Indeed, there was a high political fever throughout the entire West. As one frontier politician put
                    it, "There is a constant gathering of the people by thousands for the purpose of warming
                    each other for the fight." The pattern in each state was much the same, with presidential
                    electors taking the lead in organizational activities. Abraham <placeName>

                    precinct committees, prepare poll lists, and report election prospects regularly. "Let no
                    local interests divide you; but select candidates that can succeed," he warned.
                    "Our plan of operations will of course be concealed from everyone except our good
                    friends." In accordance with this directive, meetings were held in every county of the
                    state, many of which <placeName>

            <p>The fanfare of the canvass of 1840 has often served to obscure its significance, since many have
                    tended to dismiss it as little more than a colorful political circus. The great commotion was in
                    fact a testimonial to meticulous party organization—and a refutation to those who contend
                    that political organizations were relatively undeveloped before the Civil War. Adopting a log-cabin
                    vocabulary, Whig leaders in 1840 gave a belated acquiesence to the methods of the new
                    democracy—much to the distress of antediluvian elements in the party who abhorred
                    appealing to the mob—even when the appeal was designed to promote a conservative victory.</p>

            <p>The Harrison sweep to victory in Indiana and the nation in 1840 resulted in the complete rout of the
                    Hoosier Democrats. The movement continued through the congressional election of 1841, leaving the
                    Indiana Democrats with one seat in Congress. The hopes of the party were at low ebb: the combination
                    of state and national electoral defeats had robbed the Democracy of state and local offices as well
                    as the fruits of patronage. In order for the rehabilitation process to begin, it was necessary to
                    overhaul completely the party machinery.</p>
            <p>The rejuvenation, however, was not slow in developing. A new party organ, the <hi rend="i">Indiana

                    publication in the summer of 1841. The Chapmans, originally from <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>By the summer of 1842, the Democrats had gained control of the state legislature and were prepared
                    for the congressional elections of 1843. The party prospects appeared brighter.</p>
            <p>It was apparent that the Democrats had freed themselves of the old leadership and the old battle
                    cries, and were taking up the standards of the so-called New Democracy. As they laid their plans for
                    the coming election, they saw that the Whigs had furnished them with issues upon which to wage the
                    campaign. There was, for example, the effect that the halting of the canal and road program had had
                    on the outlets to market, leaving them in a sad state of repair. This condition, coupled with the
                    aftermath of the depression of 1837 which was hindering economic progress, the Democrats blamed on
                    the Whigs. The Whig tariff of 1842 and the attitude of the Indiana Whigs in favoring a state rather
                    than a national bank had weakened their party unity; and following the breach between <list type="footnotes">

                    further demoralization. The Democrats of Indiana were ready to take advantage of the political
                    misfortune of their opponents.</p>
            <p>The New Democracy, however, was more than a political rebuttal to the Whig program. Under the
                    guidance of such talented orators as Robert Dale Owen, Joseph Wright, James Whitcomb, and John W.
                    Davis, the Democracy pled for human rights, individual liberty, and private initiative. The
                    sentiments of such western leaders as William Allen of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> made the rounds of the Hoosier press: and during the congressional contests, there were
                    many debates enlarging on the party principles and involving such issues as the tariff, the
                    currency, and internal improvements.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This campaign centered less about personalities than had the campaigns of the past. The change in
                    tactics was in part indicative of new leadership, but more than that it was a reflection of the
                    growing force of the western progress; it was part and parcel of the growing sectional consciousness
                    of the economic needs of the West. The result was that, being out of office nationally as well as
                    locally, the Democracy could become a party of opportunism and could promise relief from the
                    economic burdens under which the citizenry labored.</p>
            <p>The Hoosier campaign of 1843 was termed by the Chapmans in their journal as a revolution. The Whigs
                    were swept out of office almost completely, and for the first time since statehood, the Democrats
                    had elected a governor. Jesse Bright rode into state office as lieutenant-governor, and his brother
                    Michael was appointed state agent.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> James Morrison was elected by the
                    legislature to rule the state bank;<hi rend="sup">5</hi> William E. English became clerk of the
                    assembly; and Andrew L. Robinson, who was to become a Free Soil candidate by 1852, was elected
                    speaker of the House.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> The Democrats had also gained control of the legislature.</p>
            <p>On the national scene, whereas in 1841, there was only one Democratic congressman from the state, now
                    the party had elected members in eight out of the ten districts.</p>

            <p>On January 4, 1844, just a month after the joint resolution of the legislature, Robert Dale Owen
                    introduced into Congress a resolution to end the joint occupation, and by the twenty-fourth, Owen
                    was making a formal reply to the house committee that had decided his proposal was inexpedient.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> Owen was aroused by this to make his maiden speech in Congress in which he
                    upbraided the committee for its action. "We have faults and failings enough, God
                    knows—we of the West; but cowardice—tame, cold blooded
                    cowardice—the craven spirit that would desert a comrade in his utmost need, that, at
                    least, is no part of our character."<hi rend="sup">12</hi> The House apparently felt no
                    inclination to debate the subject.</p>
            <p>In the nation, Owen's speech was eminently successful; it was reprinted and distributed
                    widely in the press, appearing in two Democratic journals in <placeName>

                    Senate in February, 1844, and later in the same month took the floor again to attack Rufus Choate of <placeName>

                    nation. On the contrary, said Hannegan, this was the spirit of America. "It was this spirit

            </p>
            <p>The eighteen senators who voted to end the joint occupations were thus providing an issue for the
                    campaign of 1844. Hannegan in the Senate and Owen in the House were willing to take Indiana along
                    with them in their demands.</p>
            <p>The expansionist mood also asserted itself in the case of the annexation of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName> during the pre-election maneuvers of the political parties. While the northwestern
                    Democrats were shouting for a settlement of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>
                    </placeName> boundary, their southern brethren were leading the movement to annex the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Republic. The result of the expansionist demands was a single plank in the Democratic
                    platform in 1844 which aimed to satisfy the leaders of both sectional interests; yet the idea of
                    manifest destiny had its ardent supporters in both sections. It is important to consider the Indiana
                    Democrats' position in this controversy.</p>

                    </placeName> convention. The matter had been kept in the background partly by the secrecy of the
                    negotiations in progress and partly because it would have been unwise politically for the followers
                    of Martin Van Buren to allow expansion to become the burning issue of the coming campaign, since his
                    stand on the question was one of a "wait and see" character. For the Democracy of
                    the Northwest, it was difficult to become enthusiastic in such a situation, but when it was
                    suggested that the two prongs of the expansionist drive be linked, the Democratic congressional
                    delegation from Indiana voted solidly for it. The resolution, however, was laid on the table.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>

                    Cass claimed he feared the black troops that the British might unloose on the southern states if
                    given the opportunity. Politically, Cass felt that more and more American people were in favor of
                    annexation and since they were, action should come soon.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hannegan thus had an unequivocal statement on a much feared question that he could use in advancing
                    the cause of Cass.</p>
            <p>General Cass had begun the groundwork for his campaign in Indiana at an early time. The state
                    convention, held at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> in January of 1843, had been filled with Cass supporters who tried to secure a pledge
                    that the Indiana delegation would go to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                    </placeName> supporting him. Their effort, however, had failed and the state convention had
                    requested all the prominent candidates to submit replies to a set of questions concerning the bank,
                    the tariff, land, limited veto, and whether the potential candidate would support the Democratic
                    party if he did not receive the nomination.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The replies were all safe enough as submitted by Van Buren, John Calhoun, Colonel Richard Johnson,
                    James Buchanan, and Cass. As Van Buren's correspondent from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> put it: it was a case of answering as fully as if this were the first time that the
                    questions had been asked of him. Calhoun was amazed that he should be considered for the office.
                    This chivalrous attitude was not too well received by such partisan Hoosiers as Judge John Law, the
                    loyal Van Burenite.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>

                    Scott had been invited but had declined the opportunity. The joyous occasion was addressed by
                    General Cass. His remarks in themselves were innocent enough, but the meeting of the Democratic
                    leaders was sufficient to give the Cass advocates a chance to begin their move toward capturing the
                    caucus of the state for the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Democrat.</p>
            <p>It seems to be clear that the Hoosier Democrats had not turned suddenly against Van Buren because of
                    his attitude on the <placeName>

                    </placeName> question. This may well have been the excuse they needed to cast him aside, explaining
                    that it was all for party harmony. The unity of the party was of primary concern to the politician.
                    At the same time, manifest destiny was a solid tenet of political faith to many. To men such as
                    Hannegan, these two goals were not in conflict—they were concerned with the fact that
                    both sections, North and South, wanted more land; that slavery went with the <placeName>

                    </placeName> acquisition was more of a fringe issue, as it were.</p>
            <p>Thus when the convention met in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>

            </p>
            <p>With Cass as the majority choice of the Indiana delegation, the national convention met in <placeName>

                    committeeman and manipulator, represented Indiana on the rules committee. When the two-thirds rule
                    was introduced in order to block the aspirations of Van Buren, the Indiana delegates, along with
                    those from <placeName>

                    </placeName> and from most of the southern states, cast their votes in favor of the rule; <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

                    for the presidential candidate. On the first ballot, the Hoosiers cast three votes for Van Buren and
                    nine for Cass; on the fifth roll call, only one delegate remained faithful to the former president;
                    on the eighth ballot when the tide turned in favor of James K. Polk, the dark horse candidate, the
                    Indiana delegation still cast its vote in favor of Cass. Only on the final ballot did the Hoosiers
                    support Polk in acclamation.</p>

                    the program of their party. The expansionists were particularly interested in carrying out the <placeName>

                    proposals immediately or to wait until after the inauguration in March.</p>
            <p>Soon after the Congress convened in January, 1845, the question of annexing <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName> arose in the House. Caleb Smith, in the Whig minority, attacked the South in general
                    and William L. Yancey in particular for appealing to patriotism, claiming <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName> was merely a party issue and that sufficient reasons had not been advanced for its
                        annexation.<hi rend="sup">32</hi> Thus the opportunity arose for Robert Dale Owen to deliver an
                    address filled with spell-binding phrases in which he attempted to eliminate all the objections that
                    had been raised in the debates. He declared a treaty was not necessary to annex <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName>; all that was needed was a joint resolution. He attempted to dispel the fears of the
                    North regarding slavery, by claiming that it, like monarchy, was merely a temporary
                    evil—both would disappear with progress. According to him, it was not the problem of the
                    Negro that blocked the annexation, it was the Whig rejection of any annexation. His plea wound up
                    with the demand for immediate action.<hi rend="sup">33</hi>

            <p>Owen's speech indicated that he did not foresee the danger of a war over <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName>. He believed the dispersal of slavery would weaken the slave system, leading gradually
                    to emancipation in the border states. He was not concerned with the difficulties of
                    constitutionality, an attitude which prompted Samuel Sample, Whig congressman from <placeName>

                    occasion to say that he was anxious to vote for a measure such as this; indeed, he claimed that he
                    was prepared to go even further than the legislature of his state had instructed him to go.<hi rend="sup">36</hi>
            </p>

                    saw fit to vote against an amendment to that effect was William J. Brown. On the final vote, Sample
                    went along with the Democrats while Caleb Smith reneged. When the bill, however, was received in the

                    was pushing Cass for the presidency in 1848, it would seem that some Indiana Democrats were feeling
                    their political neglect early in the game. The election was over and they wanted no more promises
                    "that the administration may deem it a virtue to violate and needful to refuse any and all

            <p>While the Indiana politicians were confronting the presidency with their sectional attitudes, they
                    were also expressing their views as to what their role should be in relation to other sections. The
                    western attitude was one of youth—a realization of newly found manhood—and
                    with this growing self-consciousness came bluster, show of muscle, and vigor. The confining nature
                    of the federal household bore a little heavily at times and the parental guidance of the older
                    sections was not always gratefully accepted. The western child was beginning to have a mind of its
                    own. Indeed, it wanted a new status in the family, although it did not seem to recognize that
                    responsibilities come with a more nearly adult position, and occasionally it even went so far as to
                    disclaim the parent. One Indiana politician wrote, for example: "I have been of the

                    hampered the West on lands and the tariff, and had demanded for Negro representation in the South,
                    this Hoosier suggested that Daniel Webster should be authorized to make another treaty with Great
                    Britain, which would draw the eastern boundary line at the <placeName>

            <p>These western leaders were thus frequently inciting the Hoosiers to look upon the older sections of
                    the nation as contributing to the difficulties of securing the material needs of the expanding
                    Northwest. The plan of ceding New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> had, of course, its ludicrous aspects.</p>
            <p>The road, however, was usually open to bargaining for political and economic needs that could be
                    secured only through the action of the federal government. Indiana's Hannegan, for
                    example, told Duff Green of a trade that would be offered to Calhoun and the South, prompting Green
                    to write: "I saw Hannegan of Indiana yesterday. He says that the West will be united and
                    will demand funds for the improvements of their harbours, rivers, and the <placeName>

                    these to the West the West will go with the South on the tariff."<hi rend="sup">45</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was nothing emotional or jingoistic about this planned tactic; it was merely a practical
                    example of the give and take of politics, one of the points of conflict that had to be resolved if
                    the bundle of interests that made up the political parties could operate to carry out the general
                    will of the body politic. To the President and Congress fell the task of adjusting these conflicts.</p>

                    our just claim up to the degree of 52, 40, will be carried without faltering or flinching on our

                    across the mountains. William Wick prepared his constituents for war which he claimed was
                    inevitable. Since there was prosperity in Indiana, he urged the Indianans to save all they could
                    because the western valley would be the storehouse of the Army. Their nation, he told his
                    constituents, would have to tax them to support the impending war. The editors at home had
                    anticipated war through such slogans as "Peace if practicable—war, if

                    the reluctant Southerners that: "If the question is to be considered as a local question,
                    then I ask that we may be the judges of the course that is to be pursued. That is what we did when
                    the South came here and asked us, not to defend their own soil, but to admit into the Union a
                    foreign territory—an independent nation. If upon that question, we had hesitated, it
                    would have been said that we wished to back out. …You said, this is the golden
                    moment." Kennedy elaborated on this part of his speech in the Appendix in the <hi rend="i">Congressionad Globe</hi> by continuing: "If a northern or western man presumed to
                    question the <hi rend="i">mode</hi> or object to the time, he was denounced as recreant to the best
                    interests of the country, and suspected of secret hostility to the measure…. We went with

                    that their hesitation and opposition will not deter us from discharging our duty to our constituents
                    and to our country." "Where I live," said Kennedy, "this is no
                    party question. There is no difference between Whigs and Democrats on this subject. In a question
                    involving national rights, we know no party differences."<hi rend="sup">51</hi> On this

            <p>The ire of Hannegan was raised in March when Senator William H. Haywood, Jr., suggested that
                    Polk's message of 1845 could be interpreted as meaning that the President stood for a
                    compromise at the forty-ninth parallel. If these were the words of the President, then he
                    "has spoken words of falsehood and with the tongue of a serpent." <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Hannegan declared, dwelt together in the American heart. The West would not be trodden
                    on this way. After being called to order, Hannegan injected a new issue into the debate when he
                    added: "The last steamer from Europe, it is said, puts this question in such a position
                    that for <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>

                    the territory of my country.… Whence this movement for free trade on the part of <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>? Does not every one know that she has been driven into this course by the out cries of
                    starving millions? … But the West is to be provided for; it is to have a new and most
                    profitable market. Some of us know that from the Baltic <placeName>

                    Hannegan pitted himself against the administration. During the evening of the same day that Haywood
                    made his speech, Hannegan called at the White House where from an anteroom he shouted to Polk,

            <p>On the next day, Polk was severely castigated by Hannegan in the Senate, and he continued to attack

            <p>Among the fourteen who voted against ratification on June 18, 1846, the names of Hannegan and Bright
                    are to be found. Six of the last ditch opposition were from the Northwest. Hannegan continued his
                    violent attacks even up to the ratification of the treaty, for Polk related in his diary just two
                    days before ratification occurred: "Mr. Hannegan had made a violent speech, and that
                    several of the North Western Senators were excited &amp; in a bad Temper." These
                    "spoiled children," as Polk called them, held their grudge, and it was not until
                    the following year that Hannegan called again at the White House. "He had certainly no
                    cause for complaint against me for my course was a consistent one. I received him in a courteous
                    manner," claimed Polk.<hi rend="sup">58</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The consistency of Polk was one matter, but to men such as Hannegan, Cass, and Allen, with their
                    uncompromising attitudes toward <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>
                    </placeName>, the expansionist urge was another. Fanatics on the subject, they would listen to no
                    compromise! Polk explained the tempest in terms of political ambition, but it was more than that.
                    Whether popular passions were whipped up by the Hoosiers themselves or by Indiana politicians in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> is not a readily answered question. There, however, seems to be little doubt that the <placeName>

                    caused new stress and strain on the unity of the Democracy.</p>
            <p>At the time when Hannegan had informed Duff Green of the trade which the West would make to get its
                    economic program, the Indiana Senator did not include the expansion issue as a part of a possible
                    political bargain. To western men of Hannegan's background, there was no compromising of
                    the best interests of all the people since manifest destiny had been clothed with sanctity. Yet when
                    the southern senators joined with the Pennsylvanians and both hurled the tariff issue into the melee
                    (for different reasons), complications arose that <list type="footnotes">

                    wheat would arrive in Great Britain before a single bushel of American wheat could be shipped across
                    the Atlantic. At the same time, in the House, William W. Wick, also a staunch Indiana Democrat, was
                    producing statistics on the amount of western grain going directly to the continent. The wheat trade
                    was vastly important to many Hoosiers.<hi rend="sup">59</hi>

                    </placeName> controversy, had had his moment in the limelight and was now fading into the wings. He
                    showed little interest on other western demands; for example, even during a naval appropriation bill
                    debate, he brought up 'the matter of expansion. He voiced few opinions about the tariff
                    or internal improvements. The manifest destiny of the growing nation had provided him opportunity to
                    exhibit his political forte—oratory. He was a blustery and often brilliant speaker. An
                    English woman who visited the Senate galleries described him as a "genuine son of the West;
                    ardent, impulsive and undaunted; thinking, acting and daring with the most perfect freedom. His
                    spirit is youthful and buoyant, and he is ever sanguine of success, though he feels acutely the
                    bitterness of disappointment." She went on to say that the Indiana Senator possessed the
                    characteristics of his western colleagues who were "fluent of speech, quick in action, and
                    ready in expedients; they are, in fact, the very men required for the posttion they hold, that of
                    Borderers of the Republic. They are a new power, whose interests, although inseparably blended with
                    those of the other sections of the Union, are yet distinct and individual; the West but now begins
                    to assert herself, to exhibit her strength, and though yet an infant, to claim her share in the
                    'balance of power.' "<hi rend="sup">60</hi>

            <p>Hannegan was far from being a careful and calculating statesman; rather he was a politician who
                    allowed himself to be carried away by his own eloquence. His vehemence and bluster were born of
                    debate rather than of a long planned course of political action. Typical of a stump speaker who
                    never yielded ground to his opponent, Hannegan obstinately defended any position he took. His
                    impetuousness led him to say many things that he later regretted. In the <placeName>

                    came spontaneously and in extemporaneous remarks. His hurried visits to Polk at the White House were
                    in the heat of anger. To brush aside the wheat trade of the West was certainly not a calculated
                    move. In the course of senatorial debates, he was rather frequently called to order by the president
                    of the Senate. On occasion, his heated flow of words made later apologies necessary. After one of
                    these occurrences in the Senate, the Indiana politician offered an explanation for his impetuous
                    manner] "His [John Fairfield] language was meant in kindness…. It implies,
                    simply, that I act without reflection —that I press forward without
                    consideration—that I have no consultation with patience. That, sir, can be implied only
                    from the ardor of my manner, which God gave me, and which I did not bestow upon myself. I have on
                    one or two occasions been taken to task here for this ardor of manner. Let me, once for all, say,
                    look at the language—look not at the manner. Who is there that can say to me, you have
                    planted a thorn, or thrust with a dagger? Is there malice in me? If my manner be warm, I cannot help
                    it. If it be a crime and an offence to carry a warm heart—and although I say it
                    myself—an honest one, then am I subject to the reproach….But, sir, I, at least

                    demands—54° 40—was lost.</p>
            <p>While still smarting from this defeat, the Hoosier politicians had little time to regain their pose
                    for there were other battles to be fought and won if the western program was to become an actuality.
                    Sectional issues that posed no easy compromise included the tariff, internal improvements, and
                    slavery.</p>

            <p>One of the most promising sources for the study of the Indians of the Middle West and the Middle
                    Atlantic States is the body of records left by early missionaries of the <hi rend="i">Unitas
                    Fratrum</hi> or Moravian church, who worked among the retreating tribes before their culture was
                    submerged by that of the white man. A few of these Moravian records have already been printed,
                    notably the White River Diaries, translations of which were published by the Indiana Historical
                    Bureau in 1938 under the editorship of Lawrence H. Gipson; but the great bulk of them remains in

                    </placeName> collection is by far the largest and the most important. Bishop Samuel H. Gapp, the
                    archivist, explained it in this way: "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bethlehem</settlement>
                    </placeName> was the headquarters for all the Moravian missions in the New World, from <placeName>

                    records, and to suggest some ways in which they may most profitably be used.</p>
            <p>It has been my privilege recently to spend some time among them, working in the beautiful archives
                    building on the campus of Moravian College. Thanks to Bishop Kenneth G. Hamilton, chairman of the
                    archives committee, and to the archivist, Bishop Samuel H. Gapp, I have been given the opportunity
                    of going through all the famous "green boxes" of the Indian Department. My primary
                    purpose was to search for journals and letters written by John Heckewelder, who in 1754, at the age
                    of eleven, came from <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> to America, and who, between the year 1762 (when he had his introduction to missionary
                    work by going out with Christian Frederick Post to the Muskingum) and his retirement some fifty
                    years later, journeyed over twenty-six thousand miles through the woods of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Indiana, and southwestern Ontario in the service of Indian missions.</p>
            <p>While I was engaged in this search for Heckewelder materials, I kept my eyes open for other things;
                    and, with Bishop Gapp's very generous and understanding assistance, I was able to get a
                    pretty good view of the whole breathtaking collection. My own earlier studies of colonial and Indian
                    figures had made me alert to the significance of many of the documents handled. I found in these
                    pages intimate references to Indians with whom I had already some acquaintance, and clues to riddles
                    that had bothered scholars for a long time past. I mention this personal experience because, in what
                    follows, I want you to know that I am not reporting from hearsay, and also that I am not altogether
                    talking through my hat.</p>
            <p>To understand what kind of value the Moravian records have for the ethnohistorian, it is necessary to
                    know first what went into their making, in other words to know something about the purpose and
                    history of the mission under whose auspices these records were made. That is essential, not
                    primarily because it explains the wide geographical area from which the records came, but rather
                    because a study of the motives animating the missionaries will explain the kind of contact they had
                    both with individual Indians inside the mission community, and with the Indian nations outside it,
                    on whose territories the mission had found domicile.</p>
            <pb n="143" id="VAA4025-048-2-041"/>
            <p>It is an unusual story. If you want it in full, read DeCost Smith's <hi rend="i">Martyrs
                        of the Oblong and Little Nine</hi>.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Here, I can give you only a glimpse of
                    it, but perhaps enough to serve the present purpose.</p>
            <p>In the year 1740, one of the Moravian Brethren, Christian Henry Rauch, established a mission among
                    the Mahican at Shekomeko and Wechquadnach in the Province of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> on the borders of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName>. The first convert was "Tschoop" (Job), a wretched creature who was
                    said to look more like a bear than a man, misshapen, wild, drunken, product of a time of frustration
                    when his people found themselves made outcasts in their own country by white men who seized their
                    land and gave them in return a contempt that beat on the Indian's brain until it seemed
                    as if it would crush it.</p>
            <p>Tschoop's conversion had something dramatic and a trifle strident about it. "I am
                    a poor wild heathen," he confessed in a letter to Count Zinzendorf, renouncing the worship
                    of his mother-in-law's idol, which he stated was "made of leather in the shape
                    of a man and adorned with wampum."<hi rend="sup">2</hi> But the conversion of Tschoop was
                    genuine—complete and permanent. This success, and others like it, encouraged the
                    Moravians to believe that their method of evangelism, which was aimed at changing the whole man,
                    educating him, teaching him arts and crafts, restoring his self-respect, and so enabling him to make
                    the transition from old ways to new without the disintegration of his personality—that
                    this method gave the best promise for a solution of the whole displaced-persons problem which the
                    white man's conquest of this continent was precipitating. The Moravians had hopes of the
                    regeneration, by their method, not merely of a few individuals like Tschoop of Shekomeko and Joshua
                    of Wechquadnach, but of whole communities, of nations, eventually of the whole Indian race. Count
                    Nikolaus Ludwig von Zinzendorf, the originating genius of these Indian missions, dreamed at one time
                    of a Christian Indian state—not alien to but under the aegis of the Province of <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>To this great end, the saving of the Indian people from the mass degradation to which the rum trader
                    and other exploiters of human weakness seemed bent on consigning them, <list type="footnotes">

                    the Indians, but lived with them, working with them in the fields, accompanying them to the woods
                    for "sugar boiling," and imparting to them their own crafts and
                    skills—for these missionaries worked without salary, living, as the Indians did, by what
                    they produced with their own hands. They taught their converts to read and write, to work at trades.
                    Joshua of Wechquadnach became a cooper. Martha became a mantua maker. The missionaries did not
                    regard the saving of souls as a mere matter of baptism, of correct answers to catechism, or even of
                    confession of faith. It was a matter of Christian living —a thing which is caught, if at
                    all, by contagion, from the people one lives with.</p>
            <p>It was a noble experiment, but the times were against it. War with the French in <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> filled these border areas, during the mid-1740's, with the fears and
                    suspicions too readily entertained at any time of people with a strange speech and a different
                    color. Persecution of the missionaries and their flock soon brought an end to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> mission. The Moravians would not, however, forsake the "little Congregation of
                    Brown Hearts," as they called their Indian brethren. They brought them, accordingly, to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, hoping that the enlightened religious and racial policies of the Penns would there
                    assure them freedom and protection.</p>
            <p>A promising mission community was established on the Lehigh River at the mouth of Mahoning Oreek.
                    This was Gnadenhutten, "Tents of Grace," a name that recurs constantly in the
                    story of the mission. But the life of this first Gnadenhutten was short. During the French and
                    Indian War it was destroyed by enemy Indians, and a number of the missionaries there were killed. A
                    new beginning was made a few years later, at the close of Pontiac's War, at a place
                    called Wyalusing on the North Branch of the Susquehanna River. The <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> chief, John Papunhank, was the first convert here. By this time the mission had grown
                    considerably through the addition of many <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> to the original Mahican band. At Wyalusing, Mahican and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> together built a good-sized town, the houses for the most part of squared logs, with
                    gardens, fences, orchards, and streets swept every Saturday with housewives' brooms in
                    preparation for the Sabbath. There Joshua, who had a house, garden, and stable, worked at his
                    cooper's trade and played the spineh—ne that he had made with his own hands,
                    under instruction from his Moravian <pb n="145" id="VAA4025-048-2-043"/> teachers. In later years,
                    out west, when the mission had acquired an organ, he became the organist and leader of the church
                    choir. Meantime, travelers up the Susquehanna were amazed at the neatness of Friedenshutten and its
                    air of happy industry.</p>
            <p>Another mission was established a few miles north at the Indian town of Sheshequin. This place was
                    close to the great Indian center of Tioga, where trails converged from all parts of the Six Nations
                    country. The missionaries here, in consequence, found themselves in touch with the great world of
                    Indian affairs. On occasion they received embassies, as did also Wyalusing, from Indian nations in
                    the north and in the west.</p>
            <p>But up out of the nearby Wyoming Valley, where <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>

                    impossible for the mission, something occurred that changed the whole outlook and brought alive

                    of the whole Indian race.</p>

                    been keeping itself informed of the progress made by the Christian Indians at Wyalusing in adopting
                    the white man's ways without losing their own identity. The Great Council now decided to
                    invite these Moravian Indians to come west and show by example how the transition from old customs
                    to new could safely be made. Netawatwees was convinced that these Christian Indians had found the
                    best way to ride the "wave of the future."</p>
            <p>The Council sent official invitations to Wyalusing and Sheshequin, first by the prophet Wangomen and

                    West. Accompanying the invitation was an offer to set aside for the newcomers a large tract of good
                    land on the Muskingum, where they could have better farms and build better towns than any they had
                    hitherto known.</p>

            <p>Hitherto the Moravian missionaries, whose faithfully-kept diaries form the bulk of the records here
                    discussed, had had only incidental contact with Indians outside their mission—as, for
                    instance, in 1753 when a Band of Nanticoke about to migrate to the Six Nations country, invited the
                    Christian Indians to take their place as guardians of the Wyoming Valley, an invitation the converts
                    Teedyuscung (later known as "King of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName>") and the Mahican Abraham accepted, with considerable impact on colonial
                    history. But from now on, that is to say, from the year 1772 when the mission built its first towns,
                    Schonbrunn (near the present New <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>) and a second Gnadenhutten, the Moravians found themselves in the very vortex of Indian
                    politics. Not that they wished to take a direct part in these matters, but the winds of
                    international diplomacy blew strongly through their settlement. The diaries contain frequent reports
                    of embassies passing through their towns from north, west, and south. In reading these documents
                    today, one becomes aware of "cold wars" and political cross currents almost as
                    confusing in the woods of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and Indiana as those one hears of today in Europe and Asia. Though this gave the
                    missionaries unparalleled opportunities to observe the high world of Indian diplomacy and
                    statecraft, it also entailed involvements which in the end wrecked the settlement. When war came,
                    they found themselves actually straddling Indian warpaths.</p>

                    be taught to his people. Captain White Eyes and Chief Killbuck, followers of Netawatwees and friends
                    to the Americans, were for keeping the borders quiet. Captain Pipe, on the other hand, a <placeName>

            <p>This was more than John Heckewelder, who was one of the founders of Gnadenhiitten, could stand. In

                    in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>, he was authorized to seize the missionaries and bring them, with their flock, north to
                    Lake <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Erie</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where they would, as the British saw it, be in no position to do further mischief.
                    John Heckewelder's narrative of his captivity and of the journey made in the fall of the
                    year with his wife and baby daughter, Polly, to Upper Sandusky<hi rend="sup">10</hi> gives a picture
                    of "wild" Indians from a somewhat unusual angle—for example, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Ottawa</settlement>
                    </placeName> warrior who dressed himself up in stolen missionary clothes, and rode about camp with a
                    nightcap on his head. At Captives Town, as the new missionary settlement at Upper Sandusky came to
                    be called, the Brethren built themselves houses and tried to keep alive during a winter of famine.</p>
            <p>When the missionaries were summoned to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>, to be examined before Major Arent S. de Peyster, the British commandant, there
                    occurred one of those odd reversals that make history stranger than fiction. Captain Pipe, who, with
                    his warriors on their arrival at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> had marched up the street to the government house shouting the "death
                    hallo," turned out to be a man of quixote magnanimity. He could be cruel, on provocation,
                    but what he had recently seen of these Moravian teachers did not stir up that element in his nature.
                    He knew as well as Netawatwees had known that, in the long run, the Moravian influence was good for
                    his people. When the British Commandant called on Captain Pipe to present his charges against the
                    prisoners, the chief declined to make any. "These are good men," he said.
                    "I would be sorry to see them ill-treated." The major, accordingly, dropped the
                    case and set the missionaries free—with a gentle admonition henceforth to leave war
                    matters alone.</p>
            <p>Meantime certain of the American borderers, unaware of the help the Moravians and their Indians had
                    been giving to the American cause, were working up to the hysterical outburst which was to bring so
                    much shame upon them. Early in the spring of 1782, a considerable part of the half-starved mission

                    year's corn. There, in the fields, a band of militia under a certain Colonel David
                    Williamson found them. Approaching them with professions of friendship, the militia took them
                    prisoners, herded them into two houses (one of which was Joshua's cooper shop), and there
                    hacked and clubbed these unarmed people —over a third of whom were children—to
                    death, using as tools for this purpose axes, knives, and Joshua's cooper's

                    men against Upper Sandusky, he found Captives Town deserted. But in the neighborhood were Captain
                    Pipe and his warriors, prepared to take, not prisoners this time, but scalps. Williamson fled and
                    escaped, leaving Crawford, who could not keep up with him, to his fate. Crawford was taken prisoner
                    and tortured on orders from Captain Pipe, not for anything he had done himself but because he had
                    been out with Williamson.</p>
            <p>For many years after that, the Moravian mission, now often described in the diaries as the
                    "wandering congregation," was buffeted about by the winds of politics and war.
                    Under the Shawnee, Tecumseh, and his brother, the Prophet, a fierce nativist movement sprang up
                    which reversed Netawat-wees' policy of conciliation and compromise, and put the Moravians
                    high on the list of those who must be liquidated. In 1806, Joshua the cooper, organist, and
                    choirmaster, formerly of Gnadenhiitten and now a "chapel interpreter" in the White
                    River mission, was burned at the stake. Horizons narrowed for the Moravians. Their former high hopes
                    were lost in a struggle for bare survival. David Zeisberger died believing the mission to have
                    failed. During the twenty-six years he had lived since the massacre at Gnadenhiitten on the
                    Muskingum, he had seen his flock driven from one place to another: from Captives Town to New

                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>, it remained for some time in quiet. But, during the War of 1812, the congregation
                    again found itself in the path of armies. Always the flaming sword between them and the City of
                    Peace! Before the Battle of Moraviantown, British forces occupied the town. After the battle,
                    General William H. Harrison's victorious soldiers sacked and burned it.</p>
            <p>But this time the congregation did not wander. A quarter of a mile away, across the Thomas River,
                    they built a new <placeName>

                    </placeName>—they have almost forgotten their Mahican blood, though some of the old
                    Mahican baptismal names still run in their families—a good-living, industrious people,
                    commuters who work in neighboring towns but who, under Chief Omer Peters (as delightful <pb n="152" id="VAA4025-048-2-050"/> a gentleman as you will find to talk with in a day's drive)
                    have preserved their own identity as Indians. Though they are members of the United Church of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>, they honor the memory of the Moravian Brethren who led their ancestors here nearly one
                    hundred sixty years ago. Visit them, if you wish to see a living monument to one of the noblest
                    experiments ever made in the furtherance of race understanding.</p>
            <p>It will be seen from this brief sketch of the mission what opportunities the Moravians had for
                    observing the Indian world before its collapse. What use they made of these opportunities we have
                    now to consider.</p>
            <p>The Moravians had an educated ministry, and their church leaders pursued an enlightened evangelical
                    policy. Theirs was not the "baptize and run" type of evangelism—count
                    souls saved and call it a day. On the contrary, the evangelistic work was only part of a sound
                    educational policy aimed at the good life, the all-around development of their converts. Such a
                    policy required that the Moravian teachers should live and work with their people, and understand
                    their personal problems.</p>
            <p>The missionaries who made the records we are surveying were an intelligent, well-balanced,
                    well-informed group. Their eyes were not exclusively turned inward. They were interested in all that
                    went on around them. Not infrequently they were employed by the government to serve as advisers at
                    Indian treaties, or, as in the case of Christian Frederick Post, to undertake dangerous
                    ambassadorial assignments. Post, in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> country in 1758, was sold by Daniel, a <placeName>

                    </placeName>, to the French for value received. Daniel failed to deliver the goods only because Post
                    had sat at Pisquetomen's fire, and the laws of hospitality (as this brother of King
                    Beaver understood them) could not be broken to surrender him. Missionaries such as this were not
                    overburdened by the <hi rend="i">minutiae</hi> of doctrine and discipline. When they met Indians, it
                    was not the nonessential things about them that they observed. They were not looking for oddities to
                    tickle the fancy of metropolitan audiences. Their appraisal of the Indians had regard to their
                    essential humanity.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Bethlehem</settlement>
                    </placeName>, a wide range of material. In attempting any analysis of these Archives, we must note

                    people were interested. There is news here of government doings in <placeName>

                    among the followers of John Huss in the fifteenth century), but also the expansion of a very young
                    nation into the as-yet-unwelcoming West.</p>
            <p>But the section of the Moravian records which is of chief concern to us here is the one known as the
                    Indian Department, which has been just recently taken out of the old green boxes, reorganized, and
                    rearranged for greater convenience to the student. It is here that the ethnohistorian finds his
                    Golconda. Some time ago I stumbled on the original pages (scattered through three separate boxes) of
                    Christian Frederick Post's 1758 journal to Venango, describing the journey that cost <placeName>

                    </placeName> her Indian allies on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and so cleared the way for General John Forbes at Fort Duquesne. These fragments were
                    without title page or signature, but they were unmistakably Post's to anyone familiar
                    with his handwriting, incredible spelling, and style. Since I was at the time making a study of
                    Indian trails, this, the first version of his badly printed diary, was to me the Great Mogul. It
                    explained discrepancies in the printed journal and cleared up the uncertainty with regard to his
                    route. Further assistance from Bishop Gapp, whose profound knowledge of church history is matched by
                    an acute understanding of a wide range of subjects pertinent to this inquiry, including the
                    peculiarities of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> idiom and the habits of cows on the march, cleared up what remained of the Forbidden
                    Path mystery. Everywhere in these papers are traces of Indian personages who, after a brief

            <p>If you are interested in Indian biographies, after having exhausted the government records, try the
                    Moravian Archives. Go first, if the man you are interested in was a Christian, to the list of 721
                    Indians baptized up to the year 1772, a list that notes, wherever possible, the man's or
                    woman's name (Indian name and baptismal name), family relationships, tribe, place and
                    time of baptism and who performed the ceremony, place and time of death. Then look him up in the
                    Moravian obituaries, which are preserved in a section by themselves. Look for him also in the lists
                    of communicants, and the separate records of baptisms, births, marriages, and deaths. Finally, look
                    for him in the diaries of those missions where he may have lived, or, if he was not a Christian,
                    where he is most likely to have paid a visit or in some way to have made his influence felt. Strings
                    of wampum were being constantly delivered at one or another of the mission stations, and the
                    messages that accompanied them from this or that chief are carefully recorded. Netawatwees and

                    White River; Chief Little Turtle of the Miami; the Shawnee prophet, —they are all here
                    and many more, men who played a part in the history of the West, only waiting to be brought alive

            <p>A diary from Shamokin at the Forks of the Susquehanna (the present Sunbury) pictures some canoe loads
                    of Iroquois warriors stopping off for the night, and, in return for the hospitality received,
                    putting on a war dance for their hosts. The sound of the drum, the flashing of drawn swords in their
                    hands, and the movement of their bodies—not the naked torsos of magazine illustrations,
                    but all clad in brown coats trimmed with gold lace<hi rend="sup">16</hi>—these make a
                    colorful and surprisingly modern scene in which the Indians appear more like "gentlemen

            <p>One curious journal, kept during the period of wanderings in the West, is headed, "Diary of
                    the Indian Congregation in Night's-Lodging on the Cayahoga." The dates are
                    October, 1786, to February, 1787—surely a long night for this latitude. But
                    "night's-lodging" is a familiar Indian metaphor, meaning a visit of a
                    year—or, it may be, of indefinite duration. The Seneca of <placeName>

                    per lb. or 6 pence for the fat only." If the price of fat in this list seems excessive, we
                    must remember that bear's fat ms used for cosmetics. And if that seems outlandish, may I

            <p>The Moravian diaries are buzzing with movement. In their pages, one finds the primeval American
                    forest, which it is now conventional to think of as an all-but-unbroken solitude, teeming with life
                    like a ripe cheese. We are made to realize that the Indians were great travelers. Their woods were
                    honeycombed with trails over which they sped on all manner of businesses: hunters combing the
                    valleys by day in search of game, and, in the evening, still full of high spirits, peeling the bark
                    off trees and on the bare spot thus exposed painting their exploits; runners giving the alarm yell
                    as they approached each town to assemble the people; warriors uttering their triumphant scalp cry as
                    they returned from an expedition; chiefs with their retinue bearing peace pipes and wampum for
                    distant council fires; or, as happened each year among the Chippewa, whole communities traveling
                    north to escape the September fever.</p>
            <p>The travel journals, of which there are many, are among the best things in the whole collection; for
                    these missionary travelers, freed while on the trail from the routine of conventional duties, had
                    time to look around them. Fresh scenes and new contacts put life and dash into their style. Nowhere
                    will you find vivider or more honest sketches of our westward <pb n="157" id="VAA4025-048-2-055"/>

                    the white man and the Indian at his best and at his worst.</p>
            <p>In John Heckewelder's journals you may read of Indians killing one another in drunken
                    brawls, and of white men in the taverns tearing at one another until the skin of their hands hung
                    down in tatters. From Heckewelder, however, you will learn more of the pleasures than of the
                    discomforts of pioneer travel. He, like most of the Moravians, who had a strong vein of the
                    artistic, had a taste for wild scenery, whether among the mountains or on the plains, long before
                    the romantic poets had made such landscapes fashionable. He was entranced by the extent of hills
                    spread out below him as he looked down from the summit of the Allegheny Mountains west of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bedford</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He was equally delighted with the "majesty" of Indiana's
                    Lombardy poplars, "under whose shadow," as he wrote, "the buffaloes hide
                    from the summer sun." He wrote with enthusiasm about the "beautiful <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> river," where it "proudly empties into the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>."</p>
            <p>In 1792 Heckewelder accompanied General Rufus <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Putnam</settlement>
                    </placeName>, as an adviser to the Indian conference at <placeName>

                    </placeName>,<hi rend="sup">17</hi> where, he said, "articles of peace were formally signed

                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, he was amazed to see the "almost continuous" herds of buffalo along
                    the bank. His description of the Indians at the conference, though vivid, is disappointingly
                    scrappy; but he makes up for this by an excited description of the country around, which he declared
                    to be the best he had ever seen. "It may be said of the meadows of this country,"
                    he wrote, "that some of them are several days journey in length." They served then
                    chiefly for the grazing of buffalo herds.</p>

                    once. "The salt spot," he continued, "several acres in size, is so much
                    trodden down and grubbed up, that not a blade of grass can grow and the entire woods are for miles
                    around quite bare. Many heads and skeletons of these animals are to be found which were either shot
                    from time to time, or had died there. From here a great many buffalo trails lead out, and we had the
                    misfortune to take such an one instead of the right one, our guides not being with us, but when they
                    came back again, they led us in to the right path."</p>
            <p>If one were looking for oddities in these Moravian journals, one would certainly not want to miss the
                    glimpses there given of medical practice on the trail. The best way to treat a bruise, Heckewelder
                    learned from a white woman who attended to him after his horse had stepped on his foot while he was
                    groping in the dark for his hat which a low branch had knocked off his head, was to apply old wagon
                    grease as it ran off the wheel hub. Not having any handy, she applied a tar plaster to his foot,
                    which healed him in no time. For earache, he noted (apparently from the same medical authority) a
                    good remedy was the vapor of red sumac boiled in water.<hi rend="sup">18</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of a cure for spider bites, this is what he learned one day in October, 1786, on his way east from
                    the Muskingum: "Early on the 13th," he wrote, one of the Indians "while
                    driving in the horses was so badly poisoned by a spider that he gave us to understand he must die.
                    In a very few minutes his eyes were swollen shut, and his whole body covered with large red spots.
                    He pointed to his heart, which, as he told us afterward, felt as if it were under a heavy weight or
                    in a press. John Cook [an Indian] who had gone through this same experience twice in his life
                    before, made him drink a concoction of gunpowder, tobacco, and rotten leaves, the same being also

                    to those, that is, who are engaged in Indian studies? Granted the scraps of linguistic material, the
                    picturesque travel journals, the reports of Indian conferences (some of which have not found their
                    way into government records); granted the new light thrown on trails and on Indian biographies, the
                    question still remains: how solid and impressive a contribution do these records make to the highly
                    specialized and well-developed modern science of anthropology? How important, for instance, are the
                    Moravian studies of Indian religion, of council ritual, of medicine societies?</p>
            <p>The question, so narrowed, has only one honest answer. Of formal ethnological studies, the Moravian
                    records at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bethlehem</settlement>
                    </placeName> have little to offer. Zeisberger and Heckewelder did valuable linguistic work, but,
                    when they attempted to enter the field of ethnology, their contribution is disappointing.</p>
            <p>Heckewelder, it is true, in his retirement wrote and published an ambitious book entitled the <hi rend="i">History, Manners and Customs of the Indian Nations Who Once Inhabited <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                        </placeName> and the Neighboring States</hi>—but that is not the work for which we
                    have chief reason to thank him. Indeed, it was that book which produced Fenimore Cooper's
                    travesty on the "Mingoes." When Heckewelder wrote from mere hearsay (as he did
                    about the Six Nations—Cooper's Mingoes—getting his information
                    concerning them from that part of the <placeName>

                    he could be very wrong. But when he described what he saw with his own eyes, he was excellent.</p>
            <p>That is true of the rest of the Moravians. It was not as interpreters of Indian life but as
                    participants in it, and as reporters of casual contacts with individual Indians (not observed as
                    types or cases), that they made their real contribution to science.</p>
            <p>So, if there is little formal study of the Indians in the Moravian records, what does it matter? If
                    you want firsthand data—not someone else's synthesis of customs, beliefs, and
                    personality traits—for your own studies of the Indian as <list type="footnotes">

                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, had, for some forty years prior to the journey which he described in his letter
                    published below, farmed in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fulton</region>
                    </placeName> County and then in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Cass County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, and operated a brickyard near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In 1880 he sold the brickyard and used his new-found leisure by setting out alone to
                    see the western <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and to visit his brother-in-law, Colonel David P. Jenkins of Spokane Falls, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> Territory.</p>
            <p>To make a western trip was not unusual in the 1880's. Many a farmer and small businessman
                    scouted the country for good land or business opportunities, but the writing of a detailed report
                    was unusual, and, as is customary with all such annals of ordinary folk, its preservation was mere
                    chance. Men and women who aspire to or attain distinction often endeavor to preserve diaries,
                    photographs, and other personal documents. On the other hand, farmers, mechanics, and small burghers
                    are often enveloped in oblivion because their records do not immediately seem worth saving. The
                    letter of Samuel A. Custer, which is in the Crew Papers, an unpublished collection of family papers,
                    now in the possession of Arthur R. Hogue, gives an account of a middle-aged, well-to-do, but
                    otherwise undistinguished small businessman who traveled through the West in 1880. He noted the
                    means of transportation used, his impression of the towns he visited, the amusements he engaged in,
                    and such things as had more than ordinary appeal.</p>
            <p>Undoubtedly Mrs. Elizabeth H. Crew, the "Sisternlaw" addressed in
                    Custer's letter, should have the credit for its preservation, along with some two hundred
                    other interesting items. Elizabeth Crew, the youngest daughter of Israel and Elizabeth Horseman
                    Jenkins, was born January 7, 1821. On December 28, 1837, she married Jesse B. Crew, a <placeName>

                    with a large circle of relatives among whom were her sister, Hannah, the wife of Samuel A. Custer,
                    and her brother, David P. Jenkins, of Spokane Falls. Upon Elizabeth's death the papers
                    which she had collected went to her grandson, Robert Barclay Hoge of <placeName>

            <p>The career of David P. Jenkins had a real connection with the document which follows, because he kept
                    before the Jenkins family the excitements of the westward movement in which he shared. Beginning the

                    </placeName>. In March, 1845, a better location was sought in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Indiana, and five years later Hennepin, <placeName>

                    </placeName>, appeared more attractive. He took his family to LaSalle in 1852 in the hope that the
                    terminal of the <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> River would create a booming city. During the Civil War, Jenkins served as Lieutenant
                    Colonel of the 14th <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> Cavalry. After <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Appomattox</settlement>
                    </placeName> he continued to move, always westward, through mining towns such as Custer described in
                    his letter, until he settled finally at Spokane Falls (now Spokane, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>). His letters never ceased to radiate the enthusiasm of the land speculator. For
                    example, about 1885 (the letter was undated) he wrote to his sister, Elizabeth Crew: "Our
                    young city [Spokane] is growing very fast—when I was at your place or rather
                    Hoge's—our little town had about 15 or 1600 Inhabitants. That was 3 years
                    ago—we have now near 5,000 and I think in another year we will have 8,000. Our scenery is
                    fine and the country very healthy and climate splendid. Mercury has not reached zero yet this
                    winter."</p>
            <p>For thirty years or more Colonel Jenkins wrote in this manner about the communities in which he
                    lived. His letters and conversation alone might have induced Samuel Custer to take a long look at
                    the wonders of the West. But there were other reasons. The Crews, the Thompsons, the Hills, and the
                    Custers, plus all of the Jenkins family, who contributed letters to the Crew Papers, were all
                    involved in the westward movement of the nineteenth century. The Crew and Jenkins families had their
                    roots in the James River region and <placeName>

                    </placeName>. The agitation of the slavery issue and Nat Turner's Rebellion (1831)

                    </placeName>. Some of them went all the way to the Rocky Mountains while others seriously considered
                    moving. Their letters indicated that the minds of these people were filled with thoughts about the
                    West. It is not surprising then that when Custer found himself with leisure, health, and sufficient
                    money he traveled —West!</p>
            <p>No attempt has been made to note Custer's deviations from modern, or consistent, spelling.
                    In order to assist the reader in understanding the otherwise involved sentence structure,
                    punctuation and capital letters have been inserted where that was deemed necessary. The manuscript
                    itself consists of eighteen ruled foolscap pages on which Custer wrote in a very legible script,
                    using a purple ink which is now somewhat faded.</p>

                                    few and make an attempt to describe Some of them. I first visited a place called the
                                    garden of the gods. It is a collection of Rocks 3 miles from the mountains; these
                                    Rocks are Entirely detached from each other Some Redd, Some gray, Some white and
                                    Rise up to the hight of 325 feet, peaked at the top like Church Spires. They cover
                                    Several acres of land. This is grand Scenery. Next was the Manatau [Manitou]
                                    Springs. These is 4 in No [number] near the foot of Pikes Peak. They are strong

                                    Peak but failed, So I got 3 days Rashions and put out alone. I took the trail which
                                    was cut out [of] brush and Rocks by the government; it is 2 feet wide and 14 miles
                                    long up the first Range of the Rockey Mountains. I arrived at [the] timberline which

                                    that is partly decayed; from the best calculations it was 40 feet in diameter and
                                    425 feet in length. Those standing are from 250 to 350 feet high. There is one

                        <p>There is Some fine buildings in the City, a number of Churches, Protestant Episcople
                                    Church, Methodist, Catholick, Presbyterians, Congregationalist, and the Mormans
                                    which are the most numerous of all and have the largest buildings I ever Saw. The
                                    Tabernacle is a huge and Rounded [edifice] Covered with a rounded Roof of Shingles
                                    and is about the Shape of the half of an Egg Shell divided length ways. The building
                                    is 233 feet [by] 133 ft and in the center is 70 feet from floor to ceiling. The

                                    filled. There are 20 doors to the Tabernacle, nearly all of them 9 feet wide and all

                                    2 feet square. The entire Structure is 58 feet to the top of the great towers, 30

                                    most Remarkable edifices in America. The length of the building East and west is 200
                                    feet and its width 100 feet. The foundations which are of a Reddish quarts are laid
                                    16 feet below the surface of the earth and are also 16 feet in thickness. The walls
                                    Resting on these foundations are 9 feet 9 inches thick of a light gray Granite, all
                                    of which [blocks] are dressed Square. The Corner Stone of this Structure was laid
                                    April 6th 1853 and the building has now Reached the hight of 50 feet at their

                        <p>There is some grand Mountain scenery around Salt lake City. One noted high Round Peak
                                    is called Ensign Peak 2 miles from the City. It is said that the Prophet Joseph
                                    Smith Saw in a vision this Same Peak and the Standard of Zion unfurled on this Peak,
                                    and when the Mormons first landed here they drilled a hole in the Rocks on the top
                                    of this Peak and planted their banner here and the hole Remains to this day. I Seen
                                    it last September. From this elevated position a moast magnificent Range is visible.
                                    Mount nebo<hi rend="sup">39</hi> 90 miles South I could see very Plainly and many
                                    other Snow capped Peaks of the wasatch mountains. The view extends to allmost an
                                    equal distance to the North. Westward it takes in nearly all of the Great American
                                    desert and also all of Salt lake with its islands. The most interesting feture of
                                    this entire Region is the Great Salt lake its Self. It is beautiful Clear Salt water
                                    So Strong with Salt that 4 barrels of it boiled down will make one of Salt. There is
                                    a baithing place at the South end of the Lake reached by R.R. from the City where a
                                    great many persons go to take a bath or swim in this wonderful Lake. You can get a

                                    to keep their heads up and Resort here daily in great numbers. Any person by keeping

            <p>The lack of a centralized, state-wide system of schools produced a condition in Indiana, during the
                    period 1816–1843, which contemporary observers and later historians viewed with regret.
                    Indeed, not until after the Civil War did the schools secure a real measure of state organization.
                    Prior to that time the purely local character of school management permitted school district
                    trustees to provide terms of unequal length, books of their own choice, poorly qualified teachers,
                    and their own methods of payment. This situation, wrote Logan Esarey: "lasted until the
                    revision of the school law of 1843. The latter date perhaps marks the lowest level of general
                    intelligence ever reached in the State. The harmful effects of the failure to organize were felt in
                    all classes and fields of social life."<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

                    employed by school district trustees in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jennings County</region>

                    population of 3,950.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In stark simplicity the document sets forth the affairs of School District No. 6 in Congressional
                    Township 6 North Range 9 East. Located in the southeastern part of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jennings County</region>

            <p>The manuscript, discovered in 1949 by the editor, consists of sixteen soiled and faded pages, 5
                    1/2" × 7 3/4", stitched together to form a little book without covers.
                    Since the pages are not numbered one can only conjecture that they form the entire account without
                    breaks or omissions until the voters decided to discontinue the school. So far as possible the

                    however, one can note the variation in the spelling of family names. Thus one finds: Agon, Agan, or
                    Again; Bingaman, or Bingerman; Frasee, or Frasey; Hughs, or Hughes; McLaughlin, or Mcglaughin;
                    Vardiman, Vardaman, or Vardamon.</p>
            <p>Terminology within the document deserves a word of explanation. For example, the
                    "draw," mentioned on September 3,1838; February 27,1839; March, 1840; and March
                    28,1844, undoubtedly refers to the funds available to the school district trustees, who, by a law of
                    1833, could "draw" on the township treasurer for sums produced by the sale or
                    lease of land within section 16 of the congressional township, section 16 being land set apart for
                    school purposes.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Since these funds could be deposited, if the school trustees
                    so desired, one will come across references to drawing the interest (6%) on March 1 and September 1.</p>
            <p>The financial amounts given in the document will not seem large to modern readers accustomed to
                    modern prices, nor were they actually impressive amounts a century ago. Land sold at about two
                    dollars an acre; thus an entire section might produce only $1,280.00 for educational purposes when a
                    certain section 16 was entirely sold. This was supplemented, of course, by school taxes, managed by
                    the school district trustees and paid by each qualified voter according to his wealth. Moreover, the
                    trustees could hold each male freeholder liable for two days work each year on the schoolhouse. How
                    heavily the school tax bore upon those paying it—and what the financial compensation
                    meant in real income for the teacher—can be indicated roughly by giving some prices for
                    the period. A letter from Hamilton County, 1840, stated that in central Indiana: "wheat is
                    worth 50 cts per bushel; corn 18 3/4 to 25 cts; oats 18 3/4 cts; Irish potatoes, 12 1/2 cts; sweet
                    from 37 1/2 to 50 cts per bushel. Pork is worth 3 1/2 cts per pound; beef 2 1/2 to 3 cts per lb.;

            <p>No event in history has ever been so conscientiously and self-consciously recorded for the benefit of
                    posterity as was the American participation in World War II. From the flood of published results now
                    pouring from the presses, the public has gained the impression that there was at least one historian
                    attached to every regimental headquarters, pacing the decks of every battleship, and riding into
                    combat in every tank. If civilian war agencies had been as permanent as the Pentagon, and as well
                    endowed, their publishing programs would have betrayed the presence of a professional historian in
                    every office in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, as well.</p>
            <p>Whether this mass worship at the shrine of militant Clio was history or hysteria is a debated
                    subject. At any rate, it produced a tremendous volume of historical writing, published and
                    otherwise, with which the future students of World War II will have to reckon. By far the greater
                    part of it remains unpublished and therefore uncatalogued. The National Archives has performed
                    another of its invaluable services to American historians by bringing together, for the first time,
                    a list of all these wartime historical studies, both published and in all conditions short of
                    publication, made by the civilian agencies of the Federal Government.</p>
            <p>The "official" World War II history program was conceived in 1941 by the Bureau of
                    the Budget, which not only initiated many administrative studies of its own but encouraged other
                    federal agencies to establish historical sections. Eventually, some forty-odd civilian agencies
                    responded to this suggestion, and the entire program was co-ordinated by a Committee on Records of
                    War Administration, composed of representatives from the Library of Congress, the National Archives,
                    and a number of scholarly societies. The fruits of their labors, together with a few items produced
                    outside the regularly sponsored program are listed in the work under review.</p>
            <p>The compilers of this list enter their customary demurrer against pretensions to exhaustiveness but
                    it is doubtful if they have overlooked any significant work. More than 500 studies sponsored by 51
                    agencies (which are listed alphabetically <pb n="194" id="VAA4025-048-2-092"/> without regard to
                    their current status in the federal hierarchy) appear by title. Of these, only 115 have been
                    printed, and 99 "processed" (presumably by multigraph, mimeograph, etc.) for
                    distribution. Copies of these 214 studies are readily available, either in depository libraries, the
                    National Archives, or the Budget Bureau Library. The remaining three-fifths of the studies
                    catalogued exist only in typed copies or in some form of unfinished draft, accessible only in the
                    deposited records of the agency in the National Archives or still in the possession of the agency
                    itself. It is a matter of some comparative interest that while certain agencies, among which are the
                    Selective Service System, the OSRD and the OPA, finished or are in the process of finishing a rather
                    elaborate series of historical studies, the majority of the Government's wartime
                    agencies, even such important ones as the WPB, failed to get their monographs much beyond the
                    "processing" stage. It is also intriguing to notice that the names of eminent
                    American historians are attached to some of these unpublished reports. All of the pertinent
                    information about each study, including the indispensable point of where it may (or may not) be
                    consulted, seems to have been included in this bibliography. An index referring to the agency which
                    was the object of the study rather than the one which sponsored it is a necessary guide through the
                    weird jungle of federal bureaucracy. Unfortunately, this bibliography itself may be difficult for
                    the average historical student to consult. It was prepared for the National Historical Publications
                    Commission and only a limited number of extra copies apparently were reproduced for other
                    governmental agencies.</p>

            <p>This large, handsome book deals with many things besides trail driving and trail drivers. In eight
                    chapters with a total of 229 illustrations, it presents a colorful panorama of life in the so-called
                    Cow Country during the latter half of the nineteenth century. The chapters average approximately ten
                    pages of text followed by some twenty pages of pictures, most of them with explanatory notes of
                    several lines. The pages, more <pb n="195" id="VAA4025-048-2-093"/> over, are large, measuring more
                    than eleven and a half by eight and a half inches.</p>
            <p>The text is well written and tells in very interesting fashion the story of most of the leading
                    figures engaged in the range cattle industry. In addition it describes the deeds or misdeeds of many
                    other characters who played a part in the life of this portion of the West when it was really wild.
                    These include the frontier peace officers as sheriffs, town marshals, and <placeName>

                    and run-of-the-mine cowhands. Also depicted are the picturesque Britons and Continentals that
                    operated ranches, the Plains Indians, and the few women, good or bad, who were to be found in the

                    the illustrations are even more fascinating and make the book a unique contribution to the
                    literature of the West. Most of them are made from photographs and the task of assembling such a
                    remarkable collection of pictures must have been a long and laborious one. Sources of all
                    illustrations are given in the table of contents but there are no citations given for the text. The
                    bibliography consists entirely of books, articles in periodicals, and reports but is quite
                    extensive, consisting of some five hundred volumes and other publications. This is a beautiful book
                    containing by far the finest collection of pictures of the Cow Country which this reviewer has ever
                    seen assembled in a single volume. It is a good book to own, and to read.</p>

            <p>Any contribution to the very limited literature of utopian criticism is a welcome event, and
                    Holloway's treatment of some of the communitarian experiments in America is very pleasant
                    and informative reading. The book is not definitive, nor does it make any such claim, but there is a
                    surprising <pb n="196" id="VAA4025-048-2-094"/> amount of detail in these relatively few pages. The
                    result, however, is not at all a mere catalogue of dates, events, and figures; the style is lively
                    without being trite, and only one who is acquainted with the overwhelming mass of material on this
                    subject can properly appreciate the organization and selection which are evident in
                    Holloway's work.</p>
            <p>A considerable part of this attractive balance is unquestionably the product of a nice attention to
                    and judgment of the historical relation and continuity between "intellectual
                    excitements," utopians dreams, and practical experiments. The nineteenth century was
                    indeed, as Holloway remarks, "the golden age of community experiments"; there were
                    well over a hundred identifiable community projects in the first half of the century alone. Holloway
                    notes how the eager enthusiasm of devotees often pushed to practical folly the ideals of the
                    utopists; but in spite of the impracticalities, the pettiness, and the disillusion which marked most
                    of the utopian experiments, it is yet hard to avoid a feeling of disquiet in observing that the
                    twentieth century evidences little of the sublime confidence and courage which carried many of these
                    adventurers through strenuous work, hardship, and disaster without dampening the ardor of their
                    utopian quest.</p>
            <p>A short review is not adequate even to digest an analysis which treats of Ephrata, the Shaker
                    societies, Harmony, Bime-ler's Zoar, Owen's <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the Fourier Phalanxes, and the Icarian ventures, the while bringing into the picture a
                    dozen or so of the lesser known communities. I was impressed with the skill with which Holloway
                    picked out the significant and important characteristics of these manifold and diverse experimental
                    groups, and his tolerant appraisal of the reasons for their failure shows understanding as well as
                    information. Those who have accepted the unfortunate equivalence of "uto-pian"
                    with "crackpot" may find here a new understanding, especially if their view is
                    based on the mistaken notion that utopian experiments were generally doomed because of unorthodox
                    and unworkable economic ideals. It is a strange paradox that the outstanding economic disaster among
                    utopian communities should be that fathered by a successful industrial manager, Robert Owen.</p>
            <p>Another feature of Holloway's description of the utopian era in America is his
                    appreciation of the positive and constructive contributions which these communitarian efforts made
                    to the intellectual and institutional life of the country, a recognition sadly lacking in most
                    surveys of this important facet of <pb n="197" id="VAA4025-048-2-095"/> our cultural history. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, for instance, was not successful as a utopian community, but its failure should not
                    preclude an evaluation of the cultural contributions it engendered: the first kindergarten, the
                    first nursery school, the institution of free libraries, the inspiration of a free school system in
                    Indiana and hence throughout the Middle West, and the first school system offering equal advantages
                    to both sexes. Of these significant consequences of utopian experiment, Hollo-way is properly, but
                    almost uniquely, observant.</p>
            <p>In any such brief work one would expect to encounter occasionally somewhat sweeping generalizations
                    and opinions; while Holloway does not document his every assertion with a footnote, his descriptions
                    and judgments seem, on the whole, authoritative and sound.</p>

            <p>There have been a number of articles and chapters of books, as well as published portions of diaries
                    and plantation accounts, that have dealt with the care and health of slaves, but this is the first
                    monograph that treats the subject in its entirety and in relation to the medical problems facing the
                    country as a whole.</p>
            <p>The study is set in its proper perspective by a summary of the medical conditions in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in the second quarter of the nineteenth century. This resume reveals the low state of
                    public health and the apathy toward health reforms, and it shows that problems in the South differed
                    from those in other rural areas only because of climatic conditions and the large Negro population.</p>
            <p>Cholera and yellow fever epidemics attracted more attention than the other diseases, but Postell
                    maintains that the domestic diseases constituted the greater hazard to the slave and the owner. Of
                    these, pneumonia was probably the most fatal; but tetanus, dysentery, and dietary disturbances also
                    took a rather large toll. Negroes were the greatest sufferers from cholera, but malaria troubled
                    them little. Similarly, <pb n="198" id="VAA4025-048-2-096"/> there is little mention of venereal
                    infection, and tuberculosis was much less common before emancipation than after.</p>
            <p>To cure the ills of the slaves there were several types of "doctors": botanic,
                    regular, homeopaths, hydropathists, eclectics, and "medicine men." But domestic
                    cures—based on tradition, the "doctor book," popular magazines, and
                    agricultural journals—underlay the medical practice in the South. The prescription of the
                    "doctor" or the self-appointed practitioner might be good, bad, or indifferent and
                    the rating frequently varied from one disease to another. In comparing treatments for flux,
                    pleurisy, and worms, the author concludes that the domestic remedy was best in two cases and that
                    the botanic remedy did the "least amount" of harm in the third case. The regular
                    medical treatment did not "score." The reader, of course, is not to conclude that
                    this was true for all diseases. While quakery, superstition, magic, and sheer humbug constituted
                    far-too-important elements of the practice of the period, and while the treatments can best be
                    described as crude and heroic, there were giants among the medical men of that era and encouraging
                    progress was being made by 1860.</p>
            <p>The planter was ever-mindful of the well-being of his slaves, and the conclusion is reached that the
                    "over-all picture of slave health is simply a picture of health conditions in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, and their health status was no better and no worse than that of the populace as a
                    whole for that period" (p. 164).</p>
            <p>The cataloging of ills and remedies does not lend itself to a smooth-flowing narrative style, but the
                    problems presented by such a study do not excuse such loose writing as the following: "Dr.
                    Philips of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>

                    of the children, getting all the sour milk" (p. 35); and "Unfortunately, Negro
                    women were not all the traditional born cooks depicted in literature" (p. 37). There are
                    some other slips in writing and in calculations, but they do not detract seriously from the value of
                    this volume to the student of slavery and the antebellum South.</p>

            <p>Too often the interest of the reading public in local history has suffered because of the formal and
                    pedantic style of certain writers. Unfortunately, such dull and uninspiring presentations of local
                    histories have prompted an indeterminate number of readers to turn to the historical novel as a
                    means of satisfying a natural curiosity concerning early local histories. While the results may be
                    gratifying from the standpoint of entertainment, the fact remains that the novel embraces historical
                    accuracy only as a matter of literary convenience. Between these two extremes in the presentation of
                    local history lies the middle ground of offering an informal and interesting history, yet giving
                    proper emphasis to accuracy. Such is the case in this account of the reminiscences of Oliver
                    Johnson.</p>
            <p>In presenting in written form the stories told to him by his grandfather, Howard Johnson has related
                    a seemingly accurate history of the events and situations which attended the earliest settlers of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion</region>
                    </placeName> County, Indiana. The greater portion of the story deals with Oliver
                    Johnson's experiences, observations, and impressions during the second quarter of the
                    nineteenth century. The author's use of dialect in relating this story adds charm to a
                    style which is both smooth and informal. Occasionally, he has employed footnotes for the sake of
                    clarity or documentation. A portrait of Oliver Johnson serves as a frontispiece and a comprehensive
                    index comprises the final pages of this work. Following a brief introduction by the author, there is
                    a map designating the location of those places mentioned in the story. Not only does this map serve
                    as a geographic guide, but also it attests to the accuracy and authenticity of the narrative.</p>
            <p>This thin volume of ninety-two pages represents a definite contribution to the local history of the
                    Hoosier State. The author has succeeded in presenting in a simple yet vivid style a subject which
                    can be summed up in the one word "refreshing." Finally, mention should be made of
                    the contribution of Albert Fessler, nephew of Howard Johnson, and of the officers of the Indiana
                    Historical Society. In a large measure it was their words of encouragement and their general
                    assistance that prompted the writing and publication of this story.</p>

            <p>This work is the first history of nursing in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, and it tells the story of the problems and accomplishments in this basic period of
                    professional nursing and relates the world and national events which affected its development. In
                    the past thirty years a number of histories have been written describing the development of nursing
                    from its earliest manifestations in mother and family care to its present status as the largest
                    profession for women in the world. Only recently, however, has serious study been given to setting
                    forth the story of nursing within the separate states. This is largely due to the fact that nursing
                    as a profession is still comparatively new since nursing organizations, nursing legislation, and
                    educational standards for nursing schools have developed within the twentieth century.</p>
            <p>The first period of this history, from the opening of the Northwest Territory in the latter part of
                    the eighteenth century to the middle of the nineteenth century, may be characterized as one of
                    ignorance, quackery, and superstition in medical science, and lack of facilities for adequate
                    treatment. A few hospitals were established but nursing in the homes or hospitals was the
                    responsibility of the mother, relative, or practical nurse of the community.</p>
            <p>After the turn of the mid-century, religious orders established hospitals in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and began to furnish some of the nursing service. During this period Florence
                    Nightingale left the battlefields of the Crimean War to return to <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> where she formulated the foundations of modern nursing and established the first school
                    based on sound educational preparation for the practice of nursing. It is pointed out that the work
                    of Miss Nightingale in the Crimean War affected the nursing care in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> during the Civil War, and her pattern of nursing education was reflected in the rapid
                    development of nursing schools there in the twentieth century.</p>
            <p>By 1900 the new nursing system had achieved recognition and new concepts of medical science, health
                    maintenance, and hospital care were on the move. Soon, nursing schools were to be found in
                    practically every hospital and nursing home, and the need for standards and licensure became urgent.
                    The <placeName>

                    <pb n="201" id="VAA4025-048-2-099"/> State Nurses' Association incorporated in 1904 faced
                    many obstacles before securing the first nurse practice act in 1915. The nurses of the organization
                    worked for women's suffrage and the right to serve on the state committee regulating the
                    standards of nursing schools and the licensure of nurses. The nurse examining board functioned under
                    the state medical board until 1941, when the state nurses' board was finally created.</p>
            <p>Events in the first half of the twentieth century present a swiftly moving complex story as nursing
                    schools advanced toward sound educational programs as opposed to the apprenticeship pattern, as new
                    fields in public health nursing, school nursing, and industrial nursing developed, and as nurses
                    faced the problems of military needs during the two world wars. Many nurses who participated in the

            <p>Hilton U. Brown is one of the few Hoosiers who have lived in Indiana since before the Civil War. His
                    memory of events, personalities, episodes, and movements, spans a period of almost ninety years. <hi rend="i">A Book of Memories</hi> is an apt title for these recollections of the dean of Indiana
                    newspapermen. This volume is neither history nor autobiography in the usual sense. It reflects a
                    substantial degree of understanding, a generous tone, and even a spirit of youthfulness. The
                    author's apparent conservative leanings are grounded upon a considerable knowledge of
                    human nature. Hilton U. Brown has obviously found <pb n="202" id="VAA4025-048-2-100"/> zest in
                    living; he is not unduly sentimental about the good old days, nor does he find only sordidness and
                    corruption in recent years. Perhaps his study of Greek and Roman civilizations—of
                    language, history and literature—gave him a perspective about mankind which has abided
                    with him to his present age of ninety-three.</p>
            <p>This book has many glimpses and sidelights concerning men, incidents, trends, and episodes which will
                    be helpful to historians and others. Many who use this volume will wish its author had told more,
                    while historians will naturally check him against other accounts in accordance with the standards
                    and practices of their profession. These random recollections include useful information regarding

                    "main beat." His service on numerous boards and committees which have considered
                    or dealt with many aspects or problems of the life of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> has marked him as one of its prominent civic leaders. His counsel with many other
                    committees and groups have added to his influence through the decades.</p>
            <p>Mr. Brown has told much about many things, but in so doing he has revealed considerable of himself.
                    None can record his memories of others without telling something about himself. The author deserves
                    an orchid for adding the words <pb n="203" id="VAA4025-048-2-101"/> "Permission to reprint
                    granted," beneath the copyright description. Possibly here he WM acting M a newspaper man
                    who wants information to be unfettered and without needless restrictions. Whoever compiled the index
                    should have realized that names alone do not make a satisfactory guide. The book has a certain
                    composite touch—as indicated in the postscript—which may be common newspaper
                    practice, but offers some difficulties by way of interpretation. The generous use of verbatim
                    quotations poses similar problems. Such criticisms, both favorable and unfavorable, are obvious to
                    the careful reader. Hoosiers should be grateful for this further addition to their literature.
                    Perhaps with this beginning Hilton U. Brown will decide to add another volume in order to record
                    more of his memories as he enjoys the years of life beyond that commonly allotted to man.</p>

                    W. Baughman, and Ernest W. Burgess. (<placeName>

                    </placeName>: Longmans, Green and Co., 1951, pp. xiv, 271. Tables, appendix, and index. $3.50.)</head>
            <p>The project undertaken by the authors of this volume was to present some statistical analyses of the
                    social and economic readjustment of the American veteran of World War II. At least this is the
                    proposition which is posed to the reader.</p>
            <p>An introductory statement that "specific hypotheses can be safely and profitably entertained
                    even though conclusive statistical data may be lacking" leaves the findings uncomfortably
                    in doubt from the beginning. This feeling becomes increasingly more pronounced as many of the
                    tables, most notably in the "Appendix," are judged not reliable by the
                    authors' themselves. Moreover, they say that any application of the findings to a
                    geographical section or the whole of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> is left to the discretion of the reader. Certainly the study is of a very localized
                    nature.</p>
            <p>One small city in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> and its environs was selected. From this city a varying number of persons was chosen
                    for each study, the total being 416. Frequently the people under observation numbered from
                    approximately fifty to one hundred for a particular part of the work. For many of the studies,
                    merely the lower socioeconomic groups were the ones concerning whom reports were published.
                    Generally the groups compared were unmarried and married veterans as <pb n="204" id="VAA4025-048-2-102"/> well as married non-veterans. Yet there were over fifteen million
                    American veterans as a result of World War II, from all types of background and geographical areas.
                    Parenthetically it is to be admitted that this is undoubtedly a thorough study of "Midwest,
                    Abraham" County, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Having briefly considered the dubious widespread utility of the statistics presented, the unbalance
                    of the testimonies included in the text is to be noted. The word "unbalance"
                    serves the dual purpose of characterizing many of the interviews individually and all when
                    considered <hi rend="i">in toto</hi>, for a large number of the statements are apparently those of
                    chronic malcontents using the usual colorful G.I. vocabulary. It is also in doubt as to whether
                    these testimonies are quoted or composed by the authors and attributed to others. The example of a
                    field worker meeting a veteran on the street by chance and taking down two pages of conversation
                    verbatim should demonstrate why this doubt arose.</p>
            <p>Another textual criticism is that the material is presented with some misleading or poorly chosen
                    phraseology, similes, and/or concepts. This type of shortcoming runs the gamut from the American
                    Legion, V.F.W., and other such organizations playing a large role in the formulation of the
                    political attitudes of its members, to pronouncements of a more trivial nature such as having each
                    family putting up a service flag for its representative in the armed forces.</p>
            <p>Lastly, it is not clear whether this work was designed for professional or for more popular usage. If
                    the former be the case, then such facts as wives of the lower status being more likely to work than
                    those of the upper status can hardly be classified as "surprising." If the latter
                    be the case, then a more general rule of explanation of statistical and sociological terms could be
                    applied. In either case that which the authors have shown "to be a definite
                    tendency" (as opposed to a phrase such as "proved to be true") is for a
                    great part what is to be expected concerning the matters of readjustment, social mobility, <hi rend="i">etc</hi>.</p>
            <p>It is freely admitted that the forty-nine tables presented are of interest albeit not of definitive
                    and broad applicability. According to the findings noted in this work it can be generally said that
                    in the area studied the married non-veterans have a slight edge in postcwar affairs which would
                    appear to be a sound judgment. Perhaps this volume will prove useful to sociologists as a case study
                    of "Abraham" County.</p>

                    </placeName> in Brown County which took its title from his given name. As the settlement increased
                    in size, a request was made for a post office which was not granted because there was another town
