                    </placeName>, like other communities throughout the North in the middle of the nineteenth century,
                    was caught in the growing storm over slavery. Controversies that had long been brewing suddenly
                    intensified as a result of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 and the <placeName>

                    </placeName> people of various political allegiances worked together to stop the spread of slavery
                    into new western territories. A small, persistent body of them were abolitionists. Inspired by their
                    religious convictions, they called for the end of slavery and for equal rights for African
                    Americans.</p>
            <p>Historians have given little attention to the debates over slavery in the rapidly growing town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In part this reflects the scarcity of primary sources, such as diaries, letters, and
                    other personal papers of antislavery leaders. Moreover, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s financial and political leaders, such as Allen <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Hugh McCulloch, and Samuel Hanna, apparently took little interest in the antislavery
                    movement. Late-twentieth century studies by Charles R. Poinsatte and George R. Mather, however,
                    demonstrate that citizens in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>

                    universal education seems pale compared with the paper's agitation for equal citizenship
                    for African Americans. Events in 1854 and 1855 cast a long shadow across a country increasingly
                    divided between North and South. The <hi rend="i">Standard</hi> records the stories of anonymous
                    African American slaves who escaped through Indiana and neighboring states in search of freedom. Its
                    issues also record how individual leaders responded to the growing political and moral debate over
                    slavery. A largely unknown primary source for abolitionism in Indiana, the <hi rend="i">Standard</hi> reveals an aspect of radicalism in the state in this period that has been

                    of members and low attendance: "[W]e are at peace among ourselves," the report
                    proclaimed. "[I]t has been a painful duty to exclude quite a number from our communion, and

                    because of its minister's views on slavery can only be guessed. Certainly, in his sermons
                    Burroughs made it no secret that he considered slavery "a sin against God, humanity and

            <p>After two years as minister, Burroughs resigned his pulpit to open a printing business and sell
                    books. He was also appointed to minor posts in the town's government: in 1850 he served on
                    the board of health, and in 1854, he was sealer of weights and measures. The latter position gave
                    him responsibility for inspecting local businesses to ensure that tradespeople were buying and
                    selling in accordance with set standards, no minor task given <placeName>

            <p>Burroughs and his editors were highly controversial figures in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> of their time. An editorial in July 1854 indicated that they were prepared for the
                    risks associated with controversy: "It [publication of the <hi rend="i">Standard</hi>] will
                    cost money, and time—it may cost more—it may cost those who are connected with
                    it, the displeasure of some, whose friendship and society were prized." Bert Griswold, a
                    local historian, claimed that Burroughs, in fact, "brought upon him many threats of
                    personal injury" as well as "the ‘egging’ of his newspaper
                    office." It is likely that the views expressed by the <hi rend="i">Sentinel's</hi>
                    publisher, Tigar, in the summer of 1855 represented a widespread racism that sanctioned attempts to
                    intimidate the abolitionists. If black people were given the vote, Tigar warned, before long they
                    would be "made equal, in all things, with the whites. … Will the people of
                    Indiana endorse … such unnatural doctrines? ‘Down with the poor white man, but
                    up with the negro."’ Moreover, Burroughs also incurred the anger of some local
                    citizens because he supported the Underground Railroad. While no records prove his direct
                    involvement, he came close to admitting his participation when he wrote in the <hi rend="i">Standard</hi> that "most abolitionists belong to the Underground Railroad."<hi rend="sup">20</hi>

                    Burroughs and his editors devoted far more space to exposing the injustices of the slave system. Not

                    "exchanges" noting slave rescues and escapes, it also reported incidents that
                    occurred close to home, in northern Indiana. Moreover, the <hi rend="i">Standard</hi>'s
                    editorials reflected the high-minded radical convictions of its publisher and editors; in an era
                    when newspapers included little local news and when publishers often indulged in petty personal
                    attacks, the <hi rend="i">Standard</hi> proved an exception.<hi rend="sup">21</hi>

            <p>While the <hi rend="i">Times</hi> occasionally reprinted accounts of fugitive slaves who gained
                    national attention, the <hi rend="i">Standard</hi>'s frequent and more localized reporting
                    of escaped slaves both aroused sympathy for the plight of runaway slaves and alerted readers to the
                    possibility that fugitives might come through their own neighborhoods. On July 6, 1854, the paper
                    reported that twenty-three slaves from <placeName>

                    "succeeded in ‘stealing’ his daughter from Boone Co., Ky. She is now
                    safe and under the care of a conductor of the underground railway." In November,

                            the People's party in 1854, and as a Republican in 1856. Brenton believed that
                            slavery was both morally wrong and inconsistent with the principles of the Constitution and
                            that the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 should be unconditionally repealed. His positions
                            paralleled those of the North Indiana Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church. <placeName>

                    education" and that well-qualified teachers should be available for this purpose. The

                    because it was the first case tried in Indiana that tested the provision for severe penalties under
                    the 1850 law. Waterhouse was liable for fines of $1,000 and six months'
                    imprisonment if found guilty of helping fugitives and was further liable to the slaves'
                    owner for $1,000 for each fugitive whom he aided.</p>
            <p>The verdict in the Waterhouse trial was a clear victory for abolitionists. The defense provided by
                    George Julian and E. H. Brackett won a verdict that mocked the harsh provisions of the fugitive
                    slave law. Although they found Waterhouse guilty as charged, the jury and the presiding judge fined

                    national attention. The Indiana Yearly Meeting of Anti-Slavery Friends had solicited his analysis

            </p>
            <p>After 1831 African Americans, upon settling in Indiana, were required either to post a
                    $500 bond as proof of their financial independence or be hired out for six months, but
                    Article XIII of the new 1851 constitution altogether forbade "Negroes" and
                    "mulattos" (defined as anyone with one-eighth or more "Negro"
                    blood) to come into or settle in Indiana. Anyone employing or otherwise encouraging African
                    Americans to remain in the state was to be fined. Furthermore, a fund gathered from such fines was
                    to be used to buy land in Africa for colonizing African Americans already living in Indiana; those
                    who wanted to stay in Indiana were required to provide witnesses to prove that they had settled in
                    the state before November 1851. Moreover, they had to register with a circuit court. Point by point
                    Julian listed other basic rights of citizenship denied to African Americans: the right to vote, the
                    right to testify as a witness in any case involving a white person, the right as taxpayers to send
                    their children to common schools.<hi rend="sup">37</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Julian explained that, in part, the harsh provisions came about because Indiana citizens were on the
                    whole "sick of all agitation connected with the African race." But it could not be
                    denied, he added, <list type="footnotes">

                    rules affecting the treatment of African Americans were every bit as mean-spirited and damaging as
                    those that were written. Under the "unwritten code," black people were
                    "constantly subject to insult and annoyance in traveling and the other daily avocations of
                    life" and were "practically excluded from all social privileges, and even from the
                    Christian communion." Julian added that Indiana was "in political and social
                    sympathy with the Slave Power, ready to obey, ‘with alacrity,’ its
                    Negro-catching mandate! Verily, our first work of repentance, of reform, lies within our own
                    borders—even at our very doors. May the spread of liberal education and the spirit of
                    Christianity hasten our preparation for it!"<hi rend="sup">38</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Julian's enthusiasm for the <hi rend="i">Standard</hi> ran high in November when he
                    challenged readers to support this "pioneer enterprise." Although <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> seemed an "unpropitious place" because of the "inveterate
                    prejudices" of its citizens, Julian saw potential supporters in the "rural
                    districts" and assured readers that as "the most thorough-going and radically
                    reformatory paper in the entire State," the paper was sorely needed. Comparing the <hi rend="i">Standard</hi>'s bloodless war for reform with General Anthony <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>'s struggles during the Revolutionary War, Julian called on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>-area citizens to become champions of "the conflict now waging—a
                    conflict, not of blood and carnage, but a peaceful, moral warfare, requiring, however, on the part
                    of its champions, at least equal firmness and determination." "Rally, then, and
                    thus make <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>From Centreville Julian sent news of fugitive slaves back to Burroughs. On December 21 he wrote that
                    sixteen fugitives, believed to be from <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Covington</settlement>,

                    ‘put through’ the section of the Underground R.R., which runs through this

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

            <p>While the verdict could be seen as a victory for abolitionists, Julian still found the case
                    profoundly disturbing. "[T]he most damning fact connected with it," he charged,
                    was that "the prosecution was got up on our own soil—by the Marshal and his
                    aids." Julian believed that "we must begin a reformation here at the
                    North—in Indiana—before we can, with a good grace, condemn the peculiar
                    institution of the south, for we chiefly sustain it, and its spirit exists and bears rule among

            <p>In March Julian made a rare plea on behalf of American slave women. At a recent women's
                    college commencement he had attended, the college president encouraged graduates to support missions
                    in foreign countries. The "Reverend President," Julian complained, "had

                    </placeName> in the early winter of 1856. No doubt the "heavy expenses" of
                    printing two newspapers had led him to quit publishing the weekly <hi rend="i">Standard</hi> in the
                    summer of 1855 to devote all his energies to the daily paper. As though financial problems had not
                    been burden enough, in December Burroughs severely injured his hand in his steam printing press.<hi rend="sup">42</hi> But, according to articles in the <hi rend="i">Times</hi> in the fall of
                    1855, Burroughs's problems were deeper still.</p>
            <p>Dawson, well known for his bitter attacks upon Catholics and foreigners, continually struck out at
                    Burroughs as well. Although he had earlier welcomed Burroughs as a professional competitor, Dawson
                    now described him as "billious," "[o]ur neighbor of long heel and woolly
                    head sympathies" with "the dullness of a Dutch burgomaster. … He

                    instead of calling for what he believed was morally right. The People's party of 1854 was
                    now the Republican party, but Burroughs and other radical abolitionists believed the problem of
                    slavery was not being fully addressed by the party's platform. He agreed with the new
                    party's position on the extension of slavery, he wrote in the <hi rend="i">Daily
                    Standard</hi> in late October 1855, but he continued to insist that the country move much farther.

            <p>Dawson announced at the end of January 1856 that Burroughs would soon retire "from his

                    to enjoy the sweet serenity which should always bless old age." Burroughs was then
                    forty-eight years old. A few days later under a heading entitled "Obituary,"

            <p>After he closed down his printing press in the early winter of 1856, Daniel W. Burroughs, the Baptist
                    minister, printer, and abolitionist newspaper publisher, disappeared from <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s records. Nevertheless, the cause that he had championed so forcefully
                    continued to gain momentum. Case, the <hi rend="i">Standard</hi>'s first antislavery
                    editor, had earned local respect for his defense of a free black man arrested in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> in August 1855 under the Indiana Black Laws. In the fall of 1857 Case was elected as a
                    Republican to serve the remaining term in Congress of Brenton, who had died in office, and Case was
                    reelected in 1858. Years later a congressional colleague remembered him as one of the original
                    antislavery members of Congress, a small group of "dreadfully hard workers" who
                    "hung on to their principles and objects with bulldog like tenacity." Case and his
                    fellow abolitionists "won in the end, after years of persecution and what would be now
                    called brutality." Isaac Julian, the <hi rend="i">Standard</hi>'s other champion
                    for antislavery reform, took over the Centreville <hi rend="i">Indiana True Republican</hi> in 1858.

                    1854–1855 period in Indiana. Published midway between the passage of the Fugitive Slave
                    Act of 1850 and the outbreak of the Civil War, this abolitionist newspaper illuminates the major
                    moral debate of our country's history. The struggles of African Americans for fuller
                    citizenship are implicit in accounts of kidnappings of free people of color, of pursuits of fugitive
                    slaves, and of trials that tested the authority of the federal government. Indifference over slavery
                    "agitation" was replaced by determination to stop the spread of slavery into new
                    territories and by heightened opposition to the fugitive slave law. Although the nation was far from

                    </placeName> from a prominent Richmond family, Coffin had devoted her life to improving the plight
                    of the wayward, the poor, the incarcerated, and the afflicted women of Indiana. Energized by the
                    sweeping revivalism of the 1860s and 1870s, she and her husband, banker Charles Coffin, had
                    established a mission school and women's home in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, and secured a female doctor for the Indiana Hospital for the Insane. Although a
                    banking scandal later stripped the Coffins of much of their wealth and influence and forced them to
                    move to <placeName>

                    </placeName> in 1884, Rhoda's accomplishments, while tarnished, were not forgotten.

                    </placeName> honored the achievements of its former citizen.</p>
            <p>Rhoda Coffin was a leading figure in humanitarian and reform work in Indiana from the 1860s to the
                    1880s, when the establishment of prisons for juveniles and women significantly changed the justice
                    system. Her life illuminates the process of nineteenth-century reform and the role of women in it.
                    Some have argued that Coffin fought to expand women's rights in a male-dominated society.
                    Others have defined her actions as socially acceptable benevolence accomplished in the shadow of her
                    prominent husband. But Coffin's life cannot be summed up neatly by either contention, since
                    the boundaries between nineteenth-century traditional benevolence and political activism were too
                    blurred. Instead, her career was characterized by activities to assert women's moral
                    leadership in the public sphere while fighting for women's fundamental rights as well.</p>
            <p>Coffin's life also represents the direction taken by many Orthodox <placeName>

                    Coffin's actions were also influenced by the evangelistic fervor of nineteenth-century non-<placeName>

                    practiced quietism, a meditative form of worship in which an "Inner Light" or
                    voice of God could be revealed. Although Rhoda accepted these teachings, she questioned the rigidity
                    and formality of their practice. Quietly, she envied the spiritual freedom exhibited by the

                    not only acceptable but also advisable in promoting the greater good of temperance, antislavery, and
                    prison reform.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Rhoda's father-in-law, Elijah Coffin, supported Gurney's evangelical goals and used
                    his influence as clerk of the yearly meeting to unite and guide Orthodox Quakerism toward the
                    Gurneyite camp. His was a difficult task, since Orthodox members had divided over many theological
                    issues. One major split, for example, occurred in 1827, when Elias Hicks and his followers broke
                    away over doctrinal issues. Many Hicksite Quakers, including Lucretia Mott, became involved in such
                    "worldly" causes as antislavery and women's rights.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another challenge came from disagreements over slavery. In 1842, a group contending that Orthodox
                    Friends' stance was too weak broke away to form the Anti-Slavery Friends (ASF). The ASF
                    remained separate from the Orthodox fold until 1857, at which time they felt the Orthodox had
                    embraced their position.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> Others left the Orthodox body for conservative
                    reasons. John Wilbur, convinced that the Society under Gurney was becoming too evangelical,
                    established his own meetings in 1843, which embraced the old principles of isolation, plain dress,
                    and reflection.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By mid-nineteenth century, Quakers were deeply divided, with Gurneyite Orthodox Friends occupying a
                    middle ground. Within these confines, the Coffin family made some attempts at charitable activities
                    "in the world." As early as 1835, Elijah had established the first Friends sabbath
                    school in the region, which many Orthodox Quakers disapproved because of its evangelical origin, its
                    outreach to non-Quakers, and its tendency to draw Friends into society.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> Rhoda

                    thousand, many of whom prayed and testified publicly for the first time. From this meeting, a weekly
                    prayer group was established at the Coffin home, where younger Friends, who felt dominated by elder
                    members in worship services, could pray and testify freely.<hi rend="sup">15</hi> For Rhoda, the

            <p>Thomas Hamm has argued that this prayer meeting reflected a great renewal movement in Orthodox
                    Quakerism. Inspired by national and local evangelicalism, members sought to modify and reform <placeName>

                    argued that Quakers were to be "lights" in their communities by working for social
                    reform "in the world."<hi rend="sup">17</hi>

                    </placeName> author Hannah Whitall Smith and her husband, Robert, similarly conducted reform work
                    together. In addition, fellow Richmondite and reformer Sarah Smith and her husband, James, were
                    important renewalists who worked for Indiana prison reform. In many cases, Margaret Bacon states,
                    "it was not unusual to find the wife the stronger member of the team."<hi rend="sup">19</hi> Certainly Hannah Smith and Sarah Smith were the more prominent spouses in
                    their marriages. However, both Coffins were well known for their reform activities, and Rhoda
                    described their work as a team effort: "My husband threw his whole soul into the various
                    branches of work, and in all the various interests we went hand in hand … I praise the
                    Lord that we were permitted to be united."<hi rend="sup">20</hi>

            <p>Although Rhoda Coffin's reform activities were carried out largely in conjunction with those
                    of her husband, she also worked closely with other women. During the 1860s, women's reform
                    groups responded to the Civil War's expanded challenges to aid the wounded and minister to
                    the poor. The war brought evangelical women into public life more fully, although they were under
                    the supervision of men. Sellman observes that men initially directed charitable activities in <placeName>

                    and 1863 were especially hard on the poor. While local farmers helped by donating wagonloads of
                    wood, flour, meal, and potatoes, Rhoda and a group of women Friends undertook house-to-house visits

            <p>Rhoda Coffin's work in the sabbath school remained well within the realm of socially

                    activities inherent to women's benevolent role. Since the Second Great Awakening, women,
                    formerly confined to the "domestic sphere," had been called upon by evangelicals

                    the south side of town, an area heavily populated by German immigrants, created problems. The school
                    sought to heal tensions and divisions between rich and poor and native and immigrant, which had
                    intensified since the 1840s and 1850s because of the increased number of immigrants in town and an

                    Protestants. Using Nancy Hewitt's categories of women reformers—upper-class
                    "benevolents," middle-class perfectionists, and radical ultraists

                    call the meeting herself with "intense burning in my soul for the advancement of the
                    work" and with great fear that "I was about to break the rules of the

            <p>One of the Association's greatest accomplishments was the establishment of a Home for

                    HMA members identified the need for a place where "helpless women with children, friendless
                    girls, strangers passing though the city … and diseased, deformed, and illegitimate
                    children" could go for refuge.<hi rend="sup">42</hi> At the request of Rhoda and six other
                    women, each of whom represented a different church denomination in town, Charles agreed to pursue

                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>

            </p>
            <p>Women who justified their move from the private arena into reform with the argument that
                    women's morality and influence was needed in the public realm have been labeled by most
                    historians as "social feminists." Nineteenth-century reformers who challenged the
                    sexual social hierarchy and fought for equal political and legal rights have often been called
                    "radical feminists." For Coffin, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> renewal movement was the key to her establishing a philanthropic career. Hence, to
                    label her a "feminist" without qualification is misleading.<hi rend="sup">48</hi>
                    Her reform work, especially in the 1860s, was grounded in the idea that women's morality
                    was needed in the world. While many other Hicksite women challenged the political structure by
                    campaigning for women's rights and suffrage, Coffin always acted within a socially
                    acceptable public role. And, like most other wealthy women philanthropists, her reform work was
                    carried out in close partnership with her husband, whose financial resources and high position
                    provided invaluable support.</p>

                    undercut gender equality within Quakerism. Moreover, Gurney's attitudes toward women also
                    affected Orthodox Quakers' thinking in the mid-nineteenth century. While Gurney believed
                    that women had a right to preach, he said they must not usurp authority from men; the stronger sex
                    should "fight the battles of the Lord."<hi rend="sup">49</hi>

                    </placeName> were significantly more radical than Rhoda Coffin and her Gurneyite colleagues. The
                    Friends of Human Progress, also known as Progressive or Congregational Friends, who were composed
                    primarily of former Hicksites, promoted equal rights for blacks and women in the 1850s. Mary Frame
                    Thomas, a physician and Richmond's most prominent women's rights activist and
                    Progressive Friend, edited and published the national women's rights journal <hi rend="i">The Lily</hi> from 1855 to 1857.<hi rend="sup">50</hi>

                    the Indiana Women's Rights Association, which called for every woman to find
                    "useful and lucrative ernployment."<hi rend="sup">51</hi> In 1855, the Association

            <p>Coffin was not involved in these women's rights organizations. During her early career she
                    used only moral suasion to achieve her goals. She also placed family responsibilities first. In her
                    words, no Christian work should interfere with the "relation of or duties as husband and
                    wife," and she asserted that these responsibilities were compatible with reform work only
                    with a "proper system and arrangement of home and its duties."<hi rend="sup">53</hi>

                    state penitentiaries to assess conditions and recommend improvements. The Coffins believed that this
                    opportunity would enable them to improve prison conditions and bring the gospel to inmates.
                    "Our first work as far as we conceived it," Rhoda recalled, "was to carry
                    the glad tidings of the Gospel to those in bonds." They were unprepared for the

                    the prison committee of the Indiana legislature to investigate. In a letter to the prison warden,
                    Charles proposed methods to improve management, including religious instruction through prayer
                    meetings and sabbath schools.<hi rend="sup">57</hi> However, both Coffins were perceptive enough to
                    know that holding sabbath school would not end the abuses women were subjected to in such a system.</p>
            <p>Coffin's response to the shocking testimony she encountered at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                    </placeName> was to propose that the state establish a separate female prison operated solely by
                    God-fearing women. Like other women prison reformers of her time, she believed that a
                    "woman is the best adapted to have charge of, meet the wants, and supply the needs of
                    female prisoners" and that a woman alone "can understand the susceptibilities,
                    temptations, weaknesses, and the difficulties by which such prisoners are surrounded."<hi rend="sup">58</hi> Most important, she felt that women, who would have the female
                    prisoners' interests at heart, could best reform them.</p>
            <p>Her philosophy on prison reform fit well within a new reform movement that began in the 1860s.
                    Estelle Freedman suggests that where early prison reformers visited prisons and established private
                    homes for "friendless" or discharged women, post-Civil War reformers, bolstered by
                    their wartime social service experiences, "adopted new methods and added new
                    responsibilities to their reform agenda, including authority on state correctional boards and
                    institutions." These "professional" reformers argued that only women had
                    the ability to properly care for their sex. As Freedman points out, three principles guided their
                    actions: "The separation of women prisoners from men; the provision of differential,
                    feminine care; and control over women's prison by female staff and management."<hi rend="sup">59</hi> Coffin's ideas and efforts on prison reform were in the vanguard of
                    the movement and would make her a national leader.</p>

            <p>Although women did not achieve sole control of the institution, the reformatory law did grant them
                    specific rights. Its passage also pushed Coffin further into the political realm. Her lobbying with
                    her friend Sarah Smith, superintendent of the <placeName>

            <p>Her belief that female prisoners could be reformed and thereafter lead productive lives reflected a
                    new philosophy in prison reform. Rather than serving as penitentiaries (in which prisoners were left
                    alone to repent their conduct), prisons were to become rehabilitation centers. By the 1860s, prison
                    matrons already supervised an increasing number of women prisoners, but they had little reformative
                    effect; reformers believed it was because "as working-class women, they were unlikely to
                    provide the middle-class role models that progressive penologists recommended." By the
                    1870s, the reformation of female inmates by the care and instruction of "respectable
                    women" became the prison reformers' objective.<hi rend="sup">63</hi>

            <p>Freedman points out similarities among these late-nineteenth-century reformers. Most received strong
                    religious training, were educated at female academies, and sought benevolent reforms while they were
                    also wives and mothers. Even as they entered the public sphere as volunteers, and later as
                    professional reformers, they continued to value domesticity and female moral superiority. In
                    contrast, the Progressive era reformers who followed them were mostly paid professionals; they had
                    little religious impulse to convert fallen women and dropped the idea of female superiority.<hi rend="sup">67</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The passage of the women's prison bill did not mark the end of Coffin's involvement
                    in the movement. Although the Indiana women's prison would not be completed until 1873, she
                    remained active in overseeing its progress and in promoting prison reform nationally. In 1870 she
                    and Charles traveled to <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>Clearly, the contrast was not lost on Coffin. In Smith, she saw an angel "illuminated by a
                    sacred light direct from the Holy Spirit under whose inspiration she was then acting."<hi rend="sup">71</hi> Coffin felt that she and her fellow reformers were women of high moral
                    character whose duty was to help the fallen woman travel the narrow path. While she supported and
                    comforted her female charges, theirs was not a relationship between equals. If, as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Spencer</settlement>
                    </placeName> claims, her work promoted a "sense of sisterhood with women of all classes and
                    conditions," it was a sisterhood of the upright reaching down to aid the fallen.<hi rend="sup">72</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This unequal relationship is evident in Coffin's reformatory philosophy, which focused on
                    the special needs of female prisoners. To make them productive, God-fearing wives and mothers, her
                    programs stressed the concept of domestic womanhood. Although she promoted this ideal for inmates,
                    her own experience clearly pushed her outside the boundaries of this restrictive sphere. As an
                    author, lecturer, and manager, Coffin herself moved comfortably into the male-dominated realm, even
                    as she continued to prescribe traditional roles for inmates.</p>
            <p>Her emphasis on the value of labor in the reformation process calls attention to the prominence of
                    class divisions in her theories. "The poorer classes," she reflected,
                    "imbibe the spirit of their more favored sisters" who believed that labor was
                    "beneath the dignity of a lady of culture," and thus ignored ways in which they
                    could make an honest living. Coffin believed that labor was "essential to
                    reformation," since "idleness and pride engender vice." In the
                    reformatory women were taught housewifery and sewing skills.<hi rend="sup">73</hi>

            <p>Only a few years after its establishment, the Indiana Reformatory Institute received national acclaim
                    for its accomplishments. Comstock (who had withdrawn under pressure from issuing the call to form
                    the HMA a decade before) visited the prison in 1875 and afterwards wrote to Indiana Governor Thomas
                    Hendricks, "I have visited all the State Prisons from the Atlantic to the <placeName>

            <p>Although the Institute received praise from outsiders, its internal management was riddled with

                    operation, the reformatory law gave a male board of managers full financial control. During the

                    spoke to the National Prison Congress about the importance of femaleantrolled women's
                    prisons. In her words, "a woman's prison should be entirely under the control of
                    women, from the board of managers to the lowest officer."<hi rend="sup">76</hi> As the
                    first woman to speak before the congress in its six-year history, she was relieved to hear strong

            <p>In March 1877 a select committee of the Indiana Senate found that the Institute's budget had
                    been poorly managed under the board. In light of this evidence and the problems between the
                    superintendent and the board of managers, the legislature passed a bill creating a new female board.
                    The governor immediately appointed Coffin to the office, and soon afterwards she assumed the
                    board's presidency. Although opponents were convinced that the
                    "experiment" would fail, within a few years, the women rectified the

                    Sellman argues that this revivalist spirit allowed <placeName>

                    </placeName> women to transcend social boundaries in the name of redeeming men, particularly in
                    relation to temperance. The winter of 1873-1874 saw a rapidly spreading national grass-roots
                    uprising of evangelical women against saloons, which broke out in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName> in Feburary 1874. From February to mid-May evangelical women gathered to "pray
                    and sing hymns outside of local saloons," and Coffin was one of the strongest leaders of
                    the group.<hi rend="sup">81</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Initially, the crusaders employed moral suasion and revivalist tactics to shame patrons into
                    abandoning saloons. Later they recorded saloon patron's names and threatened their jobs.
                    The women also increasingly excluded male allies, who were involved in the beginning of the
                    movement. Sellman concludes that "although most had no intention of embracing
                    women's rights, it seemed clear that the Crusade helped transform these women."<hi rend="sup">82</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Class and ethnicity played strong roles in the movement. Crusaders were native-born women of British
                    ethnicity from the most prominent and wealthy families, and their targets were saloons on the south
                    side of town, which was populated heavily by German immigrants whose culture included the use of
                    alcohol. Germans strongly resented the wealthy reformers' intrusions into their
                    neighborhood—intrusions that dated back to the establishment of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Street Sabbath School and the Home for Friendless Women. Germans also argued that the

            <p>The crusade's outcome caused Coffin to reevaluate her evangelical activity. By the

                    renewal movement had attempted to eliminate practices it thought archaic and outmoded, such as
                    strict rules on marriage, elder member governance, and isolation from the world, the new revival
                    movement "obliterated the plain life [and] revolutionized the basis and form of <placeName>

            <p>In 1880 Coffin had begun to work toward securing a female physician for the Indiana Hospital for the
                    Insane, and she met opposition here as well. A group consisting of Dr. William B. Fletcher,
                    superintendent of the Hospital, Dr. Mary Thomas of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Sarah Smith of the Women's Reformatory Institute, and Coffin attempted to
                    persuade the hospital's board of managers that the asylum needed a woman doctor on the
                    staff. The board was uncooperative and constructed obstacles to the appointment. A member requested
                    numerous detailed recommendations from the institutions the reformers' candidate had
                    attended, as well as a petition signed by leading businessmen of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, who, unlike women, were voters and constituents. Finally, board members demanded a
                    recommendation from the governor.<hi rend="sup">92</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A frustrated Rhoda Coffin met with Governor Albert Porter, who told her he had promised the position
                    to her colleague in the project, Dr. Thomas. Rhoda knew this to be false and informed Thomas, who
                    then wrote to the governor that she preferred to remain in private practice. Cornered, the governor
                    wrote a recommendation for their candidate. In 1884, Superintendent Fletcher remarked in his annual
                    report that the hospital's new doctor, Sarah Stockton, had "given complete
                    satisfaction in every way" and that a "special improved condition of the female
                    patients under her charge" was evident.<hi rend="sup">93</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Her work to secure a female doctor for the hospital changed Coffin's outlook towards
                    women's rights: "I came out of that contest a full-fledged woman suffragist. If a
                    vote was necessary before I could succeed in getting a woman physician to care for the helpless of
                    my sex, I decided that I must have a vote."<hi rend="sup">94</hi>

                            Coffin's work with the Indiana Hospital for the Insane is not documented by other
                            primary sources. A rare exception is a letter from Dr. William B. Fletcher's wife,
                            Agnes, to Coffin that mentions her involvement in improving the hospital. Agnes relates that
                            her "plan for turning the eastward Dormitory into a room for work, amusement and
                            instruction will be delightfully feasible just as soon as the eight additional wards are
                            finished." She also proclaims that "scarcely a day passes that I do not

                    addressed the General Assembly, and worked closely with Susan B. Anthony and Lucy Stone. Although
                    their proposed suffrage amendment was defeated in 1883, the participants in the women's
                    rights campaign laid the foundation for final ratification of suffrage by Indiana in 1921.<hi rend="sup">95</hi>

            <p>Although Coffin claimed that her involvement in securing a female physician for the asylum led her to
                    support women's rights, she never fought for suffrage. She continued to collaborate with
                    Charles, embracing asylum reform as passionately as she had prison work. In 1882–1883,
                    she and Charles toured asylums in <placeName>

                    religious newspapers.<hi rend="sup">96</hi> Upon their return, Rhoda supplied the Indiana hospital

            </p>
            <p>The campaign for a woman physician may have influenced Coffin to urge women's equality

                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> establishments. In 1881 Professor Mahalah Jay, who taught at the Earlham College
                    preparatory school, criticized the small number of female professors and the large pay discrepancy
                    between men and women faculty members at the school. While others remained silent, Coffin came to
                    Jay's support by emphasizing that Quakers, who professed "the equality of men and
                    women should [not] have such an inconsistency in their institution."<hi rend="sup">98</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Her support for equal pay for women professors is consistent with her new thinking at the time.
                    Although she continued to emphasize women's moral superiority in justifying their presence
                    in the workplace, Coffin now spoke of a woman's right to hold positions for which she was
                    qualified. Although her view of women's morality continued to shape her argument, her
                    emphasis had shifted perceptibly.</p>

                    career of benevolence of the sort common to evangelical upper class women of the era."
                    Women in the renewal movement, who were at best their husband's partners, worked behind the
                    scenes. Rhoda Coffin, in Hamm's opinion, was content to remain in the socially acceptable
                    and subordinate roles her more radical Hicksite counterparts had rejected.<hi rend="sup">100</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Each historian has captured a side of Coffin's character. What is missing from both
                    portrayals is an understanding of the complexity at the core of her actions. As Hamm indicates,
                    Coffin displayed many of the characteristics of the "benevolent" woman. She
                    believed women's Christian morality was an important force in society, and she promoted
                    women's roles as wife and mother. However, her involvement in combating abuses against
                    female prisoners and fighting legislative battles shaped her increasingly progressive stance for
                    women's equality. By the 1880s, Coffin had recognized the need for women's
                    political rights to bolster the power of moral suasion in fighting the ills of society.</p>
            <p>The 1880s represented not only a time of ideological growth and continued public service for the
                    Coffins, they also were marked by a devastating scandal. In July 1884 Charles's bank in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName> failed and was placed in receivership, an event that cast a shadow on the
                    Coffins' previous accomplishments and restricted their future endeavors. Not only did they
                    lose much of their fortune, but their fellow Richmondites blamed both Charles and his sons for the
                    bank's demise. According to Hamm, the investigation showed that "while Coffin was
                    outwardly a pillar of religion and morality, he had extended large, unsecured loans to his sons for
                    speculative purposes, watered his bank's stock, misrepresented its assets, and embezzled
                    funds from estates for which he was a trustee."<hi rend="sup">101</hi>

            <p>As her health failed and she became less active, Coffin took comfort in her past accomplishments. Her
                    work in the prison reformatory movement had been ground-breaking. Prompted by evangelical fervor and
                    informed by the idea of inherent female morality, her benevolent career evolved to embrace the more
                    "masculine" roles of campaigner, public speaker, and author. Yet, in assuming new
                    roles, she continued to argue for and support women's moral influence in family life and
                    society.</p>

            <p>Having surveyed local history archives over the past four years, the Indiana Archives series broadens
                    its geographical and methodological scope this year to explore some oral history resources available
                    in the state. As a relatively new research tool and field of study, oral history makes its most
                    obvious contribution in compensating, at least partially, for the absence of written documents. Yet
                    oral history also has been part of a broader effort to redefine the boundaries of traditional
                    scholarship, diversify its sources of information, and democratize the process of historical
                    interpretation. Indeed, oral history is unique in that it creates its own documents, and these
                    records are by definition dialogues between history and memory, narratives describing past
                    experiences through the present context of remembrance.</p>
            <p>Oral history's potential value must therefore be tempered by an awareness that it is a
                    product of historical consciousness, or the way people understand and articulate their pasts. Those
                    who generate, read, and use oral testimony must guard against the uncritical acceptance of broad
                    historical judgments made by those who have wielded political, economic, or social authority and the
                    relegation of those not in such positions to a kind of impressionistic sideshow, with little more to
                    offer than personal observations or recalled feelings. A second, related challenge is to welcome
                    first-hand accounts of events while refraining from granting sole interpretive power to them, as if
                    there were no independent sources of knowledge with which to assess their perspectives. Add to these
                    issues thought-provoking questions about the selectivity of oral history subjects and speakers and
                    about the legal and institutional guidelines affecting the interviewing process, and what was once a
                    fairly freewheeling pursuit has become more complex, problematic, and reflective.</p>
            <p>Indiana's oral historians have been addressing these and other concerns over the past three
                    decades, and some of the products of <list type="footnotes">

                    remarkable history of <hi rend="i">Steel Shavings</hi>, a journal based at Indiana University
                    Northwest, which over the past twenty-five years has incorporated hundreds of oral accounts
                    generated by students, faculty members, and community residents that highlight the economic, ethnic,
                    and racial diversity of the state's Calumet region. Glenn McMullen outlines the steadily
                    increasing integration of taped and transcribed interviews into collections processed at the Indiana

            <p>These contributions suggest that the effort to preserve the collective memory of residents of Indiana
                    and beyond is well established and growing. Hours of interviews are being conducted annually among
                    elites and at the grassroots, and theoretical as well as logistical questions about the interviewing
                    process continue. The next step, as these essays suggest, is to use these narratives in ways that
                    respect diversity, acknowledge interrelationships, and depict an interactive past, one that reveals
                    a conversation among various voices whose memories help construct a more comprehensive, more
                    insightful understanding.</p>

            <p>It is often said in oral history circles that when a person dies, a library burns to the ground. Oral
                    history is one method for saving the story of an individual's life from that consuming
                    fire. Oral history interviews preserve, record, and make available for future generations the
                    memories, experiences, and opinions of individuals. Tape-recorded interviews not only collect unique
                    facets of a person's existence, but also reflect the imprint left upon that
                    individual's life by communities and events. Because of this duality in oral history,
                    interviews provide new data, insight, and understanding for the study of history and culture when
                    used in conjunction with written records or in situations where no written records exist.</p>
            <p>The primary mission of the Oral History Research Center (OHRC) at Indiana University, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, is to foster the use of personal memory in the study of modern history. That mission
                    encompasses archival, pedagogical, and research goals. First, the center raises funds to conduct
                    interviews that preserve the oral history of Indiana, the Midwest, and the nation. Second, the
                    center uses the funding it receives to train graduate students from history, folklore, anthropology,
                    and other fields at Indiana University in the discipline <pb n="220" id="VAA4025-097-3-058"/> of
                    oral history and the study of social memory. Third, the center contributes to the emerging scholarly
                    study of memory by undertaking research projects that collect interviews to illuminate specific
                    historical issues and events. To this end, the center fosters the use of oral history through access
                    to its archives of interviews, through workshops on oral history methodology, and through its
                    website at &lt;www.indiana.edu/~ohrc/collect.htm&gt;.</p>
            <p>The OHRC began in 1968 under the direction of Indiana University history professor Oscar O. Winther.
                    Its first project was to gather information for an institutional history of the university. The
                    center's founding was also part of an innovative movement to bring the public into the
                    academy and democratize the writing and transmission of history. While interviewing witnesses to
                    historical events has long been recognized as a valuable research tool, the new center emphasized
                    its value for a wide variety of historical subjects. The influence of social history, with its
                    concentration on the lives of minorities and workers, as well as the impact of feminist and
                    post-colonial/post-authoritarian academics have prompted the center to undertake projects not only
                    for the history of Indiana but for the nation as well.</p>
            <p>Since its establishment, the OHRC has gathered a steadily growing archive of interviews and
                    collateral materials and a select library of noncirculating, secondary sources related to the
                    center's mission. The archives currently holds over 1,600 interviews, with a particular
                    focus on Indiana history. Approximately 85 percent of the collection is transcribed, and 50 percent
                    of those transcripts include an index and table of contents with the interview. A copy of each
                    edited, indexed transcript, along with the original audiotape, is housed at the Indiana University
                    Archives for long-term preservation storage. The interviews are available to researchers in either
                    location, although the level of accessibility in both places is determined by the permission forms
                    that accompany interviews.</p>
            <p>A list of the center's projects, with a brief summary of the topics covered in each project,
                    is available in hard copy and online through the OHRC website. This collections list is updated
                    regularly. The website has greatly increased the center's ability to serve researchers,
                    providing information about the collection and the field of oral history and facilitating quick
                    access to our reference resources through an e-mail link. Its text is in an easily readable format
                    for those who do not have highly sophisticated graphics capabilities on their computers. The website
                    has been used by researchers from such distant countries as <placeName>

                    factories, to old "river towns" like <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> that saw the earliest settlement of the state, OHRC oral histories have connected
                    Indiana's regional narratives with national economic developments.</p>
            <p>In addition to the regional strength of the OHRC archives, the center's collections and
                    research initiatives encompass national and international topics. A recent study of mestizo identity
                    in Central America, conducted in collaboration with the Indiana University Center for Latin American
                    and Caribbean Studies, is one example of this wider perspective. Another is the center's
                    cooperation with the Indiana University Russian and East European Institute and the university in
                    Cluj, <placeName>
                        <country reg="rm">Romania</country>
                    </placeName>, to help recover the history of that country's communist period. Such projects
                    not only contribute to the advancement of knowledge in underrepresented areas of study, but also
                    provide fertile ground for comparative research on issues such as ethnicity, nationalism, and the
                    nature of democracy.</p>
            <p>The OHRC's archive also serves as a resource for research, teaching, and public programming.
                    The variety of reference questions addressed through the center indicates the potential of the
                    archives. The center's holdings have been used for a Hollywood film about Alfred
                    Kinsey's pioneering work on human sexuality; a documentary film on the life and music of
                    composer Hoagy Carmichael; and a history of the Packard Motor Car Company used by James A. Ward in
                    his <hi rend="i">The Fall of the Packard Motor Car Company</hi> (1995). The Indiana State Museum
                    consulted the OHRC during the development of its labor history exhibits, as did the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe County</region>
                    </placeName> Historical Society for an exhibit on the county's limestone industry.</p>
            <p>The following sample of the OHRC's projects suggests the breadth of oral history as a
                    discipline.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">Biography</hi>: Oral history is an important resource for biographical research, as
                    demonstrated by the center's studies of Indiana politicians Homer Capehart and John Hurt,
                    Indiana University researcher Alfred Kinsey, and national figures Melvyn Douglas and Helen Gahagan
                    Douglas. Ingrid W. Scobie's <hi rend="i">Center Stage: Helen Gahagan Douglas, A Life</hi>
                    (1992), and the recent biographies of Alfred Kinsey by Jonathan Gathorne-Hardy, <hi rend="i">Sex the
                        Measure of All Things: A Life of Alfred C. Kinsey</hi> (2000), and James H. Jones, <hi rend="i">Alfred C. Kinsey: A Public/Private Life</hi> (19971, drew upon these collections.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">Institutional studies</hi>: The center uses oral history to study the intersection of
                    individual lives with institutions of all kinds. Some projects have explored institutions that have
                    a wide-ranging effect on American society, such as philanthropic foundations. <hi rend="i">Fund
                        Raisers: Their Careers, Stories, Concerns, and Accomplishments</hi>, by Margaret A Duronio and
                    Eugene R. Tempel (1997), made use of these projects. <pb n="222" id="VAA4025-097-3-060"/> The OHRC
                    has also studied state institutions, such as the Indiana Humanities Council, the Center on
                    Philanthropy at Indiana University-Purdue University, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and Indiana University, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. And the center has explored the impact on their communities of local institutions,
                    such as county historical societies and the influence of a single church in a small town in southern
                    Indiana.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">Industries and professions</hi>: This area is one of the strengths of the
                    center's collection. It includes a study of the auto industry in Indiana, an oral history
                    of labor unions in both the auto and coal industries, and a project documenting changes in the
                    medical profession as seen by local physicians. Several projects have cast a wider net, recording
                    the economic history of the state; the most recent addressed economic development as a cultural
                    concept, tracing changes in three diverse areas of Indiana.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">Community studies</hi>: The OHRC's community studies encompass rural towns such
                    as Paoli in south central Indiana, communities with a predominantly industrial economy such as
                    Whiting in the northwest, and vibrant urban centers such as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The center has examined other kinds of communities as well: ethnic communities
                    composed of Korean, German, and Indian immigrants; black community initiatives, such as the Flanner
                    House homes developed during the 1950s and 1960s in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> to provide low-cost housing to African Americans in an era of segregation and real
                    estate redlining; and women's community efforts, such as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s women's shelter, Middle Way House. The OHRC's ethnic
                    community collections contributed to <hi rend="i">Peopling Indiana: The Ethnic Experience</hi>,
                    edited by Robert M. Taylor and Connie A. McBirney (1996). John Bodnar's <hi rend="i">Our
                        Towns: Remembering Community in Indiana</hi> (2001) brings together a number of community
                    studies the center has done over the past thirty years.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">Life cycle studies</hi>: This is a relatively new area for the OHRC, the result of a
                    collaboration with the Poynter Center for the Study of Ethics and American Institutions at Indiana
                    University, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The Open Society funded an examination of the experience of death in America, using
                    the OHRC's earlier social history of Paoli to place the study in a context and identify
                    interviewees. The archives also holds David Ransel's interviews with Russian and Tatar
                    women about childbirth and child-rearing practices, topics examined in his <hi rend="i">Village
                        Mothers: Three Generations of Change in Russia and Tataria</hi> (2000).</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">Period studies</hi>: Oral history collects first-person perspectives on major social
                    movements or cultural changes, offering a human scale for massive forces at work in history. Among
                    the pivotal periods of the twentieth century represented in the OHRC's collection are the
                    civil rights movement, World War I, and World War II.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">Event studies</hi>: These oral history projects focus on unexplored facets of a single
                    historical event. This approach has produced stud- <pb n="223" id="VAA4025-097-3-061"/> ies ranging
                    from the impact of a tornado in the city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, to the making of the atomic bomb, to an auto strike in Anderson, Indiana.</p>
            <p>Like other archives, the center faces the challenges of preserving its collection and increasing
                    access to the interviews. The OHRC's current National Endowment for the Humanities grant to
                    create a searchable electronic database of the collection online will greatly improve the
                    center's ability to serve researchers by allowing keyword searches of the interviews. As
                    part of an initiative to broaden its potential, in the fall of 2001 the OHRC will change its name to
                    the Center for the Study of History and Memory. Latin American scholar Daniel James will join the
                    center as codirector with Bodnar, and the directors will consider adding seminars and classes to the
                    center's services.</p>
            <p>The Oral History Research Center archives is an irreplaceable resource for the history of Indiana in
                    the twentieth century and for many of the great events, social movements, and cultural
                    transformations of the last century. The center anticipates even greater interest in and need for
                    the study of oral history and cultural memory as a means to preserve the past in years to come: in
                    an age in which many are moving toward lives that leave no paper trail—communicating by
                    electronic mail and voice mail and recording documents in computer files that can vanish with the
                    touch of a delete key—oral history offers a way to record a person's memories
                    and preserve for the future the "library" of an individual life.</p>

            <p>The internet and digital revolutions have opened up all sorts of possibilities for disseminating oral

                    students, families, community residents, and scholars interested in "Nearby

                    university's Calumet Regional Archives (CRA).<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>CRA's oral history component was in part the product of the author's research

                    the interviews should be processed more systematically (storing tapes, securing valid permission
                    agreements, allowing interviewees to review and edit transcripts, and other procedures). CRA
                    archivist Steve McShane has facilitated the tasks of preservation, cataloguing, and disseminating
                    holdings on the internet. In 2001 the collection includes approximately one thousand audiotapes and
                    videotapes, many with typescripts. Some have been donated by scholars, civic groups such as the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Historical Society and the Latino Historical Society, and media interviewers. The CRA
                    also seeks to videotape all donors who contribute manuscript collections and to respond to inquiries

            <p>Over the past quarter century the oral interviews published in <hi rend="i">Steel Shavings</hi> have
                    centered largely around the acculturation process among immigrant families settling in northwest

                    local politics; Fords clogged Dunes Highway on summer weekends. Like elsewhere in the nation, it was
                    an age of ballyhoo. Victorian standards, never strong in the Calumet region, were in retreat.

                    eleven children born to an Egyptian-American steelworker and a devout Polish mother, Farag

                    <hi rend="b">Indiana Historical Society Library's Oral History Collections</hi>
                </p>
            <p>The oral history collections housed in the William Henry Smith Memorial Library at the Indiana
                    Historical Society (IHS) are both wide-ranging and extensive. Oral history interviews reside in
                    collections resulting from specific research projects and as components of collections of personal
                    and family papers and organizational and business records. Occasionally, an oral history interview
                    by itself will form a small collection.</p>
            <p>In general, the IHS library has been the recipient of oral histories produced by others more than it
                    has pursued an active oral history program of its own. The society provides guidelines for
                    interviews, offers training in some cases, and makes sure that potential interviewers use the
                    standard legal instruments allowing interviews to be used and cited. The IHS is beginning to
                    incorporate oral history interviews into processing collections, using them to fill in gaps in the
                    documentary record.</p>
            <p>Oral histories are subject to the same collection development policy that governs other materials
                    coming into the IHS's collections. The library is actively documenting women's
                    history, ethnic history, black history (all limited to Indiana and the Old Northwest), and railroad
                    and interurban history (more widely defined to include Indiana and other parts of the Midwest). Thus
                    it is not surprising that most of the IHS oral history collections fall in these same areas, and
                    many of the examples mentioned below reflect these collection emphases.</p>
            <p>The society has been involved with two programs that give funding for oral history projects: Clio
                    grants and Indiana Heritage Research Grants. These projects, when completed, usually require the
                    deposit of tapes and transcripts that they produce in the IHS library, where they can be mined by
                    others for additional information and insights.</p>
            <pb n="235" id="VAA4025-097-3-073"/>
            <p>Collections based on projects funded by Clio grants include Remembering Indiana in the Twentieth
                    Century, 1995-1997; and the Indiana Broadcasters Pioneers Foundation, Inc., Oral History Project
                    Collection, 1994-1997. The Remembering Indiana project, for which John E. Bodnar served as project
                    director, deposited fifteen transcripts of interviews in the IHS library. Eight reminiscences deal
                    with <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> are among the topics discussed. Excerpts from these interviews have been incorporated
                    into Bodnar's <hi rend="i">Our Towns.</hi> The Indiana Broadcasters Pioneers Foundation
                    oral history collection led to the publication of <hi rend="i">"In the Public
                        Interest": Oral Histories of Hoosier Broadcasters</hi> (1999), compiled and edited by
                    Linda Weintraut and Jane R. Nolan. The collection itself contains the tapes and transcripts of
                    interviews with twenty-six Indiana pioneer broadcasters, covering topics in Hoosier broadcasting
                    from 1926 to the mid-1990s.</p>
            <p>The Indiana Heritage Research Grant (IHRG) program, jointly funded by the IHS and the Indiana
                    Humanities Council, assists in research efforts that range from cataloging and translating primary
                    materials to creating and transcribing oral histories. Two IHRG-based oral history collections are
                    the Margaret Robbins Oral History Project, 1992, and Reclaiming a German-American Past: The <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Dubois County</region>
                    </placeName> Area Oral History Interviews, 1993-1994. Weintraut and Nolan interviewed Margaret Ruth
                    Schricker Robbins, the daughter of former Indiana Governor Henry F. Schricker, in 1992. They covered
                    topics such as Robbins's family; local, state, and national politics; the Depression; and
                    the Ku Klux Klan in Indiana. Heiko Muehr conducted three interviews as part of the Reclaiming a
                    German-American Past project. Interviewees describe German-American life and efforts to preserve
                    their culture in southwestern Indiana.</p>
            <p>The IHS formerly organized some of its holdings into interest groups, or sections, and its Military
                    History Section operated an oral history program from 1979 to 1985 that documented the experiences
                    of military veterans from the Hoosier state. Interviewees include a ninety-seven-year-old veteran of
                    the Moro Wars in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="ph">Philippines</country>
                    </placeName> in 1904; a veteran of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vera Cruz</settlement>
                    </placeName> Expedition of 1914; and veterans of World Wars I and II, the Korean War, and the <placeName>
                        <country reg="vm">Vietnam</country>
                    </placeName> War. By the end of the program, nearly one hundred interviews had taken place. One
                    particularly lengthy series of conversations, conducted over a three-year period, were with Frank R.
                    Dillman, who saw service in <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> during the First World War. Although most of those interviewed are white males, Eugene
                    B. Bailey, a member of the 809th Pioneer Infantry, a black World War I regiment, and Anna A.

            <p>There were never formal initiatives in the 1970s and 1980s to document Indiana's ethnic or
                    black heritage through oral history as there had been for military history, but a few concerted
                    efforts generated significant groups of tapes and transcripts in these areas. For example, Jean
                    Spears interviewed black residents of Lyles Station in 1970, and Margaret Trauner interviewed
                    Slovenian, Yugoslavian, and other residents of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s Haughville neighborhood in 1983. Carl Cafouros interviewed members of the
                    city's Greek community in 1980. Collections representing more recent efforts to chronicle
                    African American experiences in Indiana have included two IHRG-funded projects: Remembering The
                    Past: Oral and Pictorial History of African Americans in <placeName>

            <p>A number of interviews contained in personal papers and organizational records document the history
                    of women in Indiana. Women's history, which the IHS has collected for years, has received
                    renewed attention since the 1980s with the creation of the Indiana Women's History
                    Association (IWHA, originally ded the Indiana Women's History Archives, Inc.). The IWHA has
                    been helpful in bringing to the society collections documenting recent women's history.
                    Records ranging from the Indiana chapter of the National Organization for Women (NOW) to the

            <p>Other IHS collections—especially personal and family papers— contain
                    women's oral history interviews. Information on many of these is readily accessible through

                    project relies upon IWHA volunteers to locate and describe collections that include women.</p>
            <p>The IHS website can be used to locate these and other oral histories in the Smith Library collection.
                    Researchers looking for materials can do keyword or more structured searches in the
                    library's online catalog, or do keyword searches only using the IHS website's
                    search mechanism. Either approach will lead to detailed collection guides, though the online catalog
                    also provides subject headings through which related materials can be sought.</p>
            <p>Oral history interviews and transcripts continue to make their way into the IHS collections. Indeed,
                    oral histories are becoming almost standard components of family papers and organizational <pb n="[237]" id="VAA4025-097-3-075"/>

                    history as an integral step in the processing of existing collections, especially as a way of filing
                    gaps in the historical record. In these cases, the archival processor, who gains knowledge of
                    individuals and families during the course of organizing their papers, is taking on the additional
                    role of interviewer, and the resulting taped and transcribed interviews become part of the
                    collection. Meanwhile, members of the IHS's Musical Heritage Committee have begun an oral
                    history program under the auspices of the Smith Library, seeking to record the memories and
                    observations of those who have contributed to Indiana's rich and diverse musical past.</p>
            <p>In areas ranging from Indiana's military history to its musical heritage, oral history plays
                    an important part in the Indiana Historical Society's efforts to document the
                    state's history. The society's recent move into a new headquarters building has
                    given it the opportunity to create an audiovisual room for researchers using media as diverse as
                    microfilm, audiotapes, and videotapes. With these new facilities, and with new generations of
                    researchers who expect historical documentation to come from a variety of media, the use of oral
                    histories will certainly continue to grow.</p>

            <p>Few Americans today remember Carl Fisher or know anything about his remarkable career, which was
                    based on the culture of speed, spectacle, and leisure in the early years of the twentieth century.
                    Born in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Greensburg</settlement>, <country reg="inu">Indiana</country>
               </placeName>, in 1874, Fisher grew up in a single-parent family in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, quit school after the sixth grade, and went to work to help support his mother. He
                    spent several years during his teens riding the rails as a "news butcher," selling
                    newspapers, magazines, and tobacco on passenger trains. It was a prophetic beginning, as
                    Fisher's early career was to be built around wheels, engines, and salesmanship. Captivated
                    by the bicycle craze of the late 1880s, the young Fisher helped organize a bicycle club in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, participated in bicycle races, and tinkered with new types of bicycles; he eventually
                    turned his diversion into a lucrative business, first by repairing bikes and later by using creative
                    advertising to sell them.</p>
            <p>Two-wheelers provided a career start, but the emerging automobile industry ultimately offered
                    enormous financial success. One of the first car owners in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Fisher soon began selling automobiles from his downtown bicycle showroom and then
                    formed the short-lived Empire Motor Car Company to manufacture them. In 1904, he formed the
                    Prest-O-Lite corporation, which produced the first successful auto headlights and made his fortune.
                    The restless Fisher soon abandoned bicycle racing as too slow and too tame and became an avid auto
                    racer. This avocation led him and his associates to build the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Speedway, which held its first 500-mile auto race in 1911, perfectly combining
                    Fisher's interests in speed and spectacle. Similarly, Fisher was deeply involved in the
                    Progressive era's Good Roads movement, organizing his <placeName>

                    entrepreneurial interests. Using Prest-O-Lite profits, he bought huge tracts of undeveloped and
                    seemingly uninhabitable marshland on the barrier island that became Miami Beach. Over the next
                    fifteen years, he created and effectively promoted a magnificent winter vacation paradise centered
                    upon sun, sand, surf, and outdoor sports—fishing, yachting, motorboat racing, tennis,
                    golf, and polo—not to mention Prohibition era booze and gambling. By the mid-twenties,
                    Fisher's holdings were worth about $100 million, mostly profits based on
                    escalating land values. <pb n="240" id="VAA4025-097-3-078"/> When <placeName>

                    </placeName> was battered by a hurricane in 1926, the boom collapsed at the same time that Fisher
                    was sinking millions into a resort project at Montauk on the eastern end of Long Island. The Great
                    Depression finished off Fisher's entrepreneurial dreams, and he died in 1939 with few
                    remaining assets.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Miami</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and he has exploited other relevant source material. Fisher was no Rockefeller,
                    Edison, or Ford; he created no great corporations, and he carried out most of his expansive projects
                    with only a few associates. In the age of giant corporations and huge bureaucracies, he worked
                    mostly alone. Fisher's extraordinary talent was to dream up and then promote popular new
                    applications for technology. He was the salesman <hi rend="i">extraordinaire.</hi> Selling the <placeName>

                    for promotional extravaganzas. Except for a laudatory and unreliable biography written by his wife,
                    Jane Fisher (<hi rend="i">Fabulous Hoosier</hi>, 1947), little had been written about Fisher.
                    Fortunately, Foster has recovered the fascinating history of this creative businessman whose
                    accomplishments have persisted while his memory has dimmed.</p>

            <p>And magical it was, as vividly described and illustrated in <hi rend="i">Life in a Three-Ring
                    Circus.</hi> This is a gloriously colorful volume that has both fascinating facts and beautifully
                    reproduced posters from the golden age of the circus. Whether or not one has ever attended a circus,
                    it is a book that everyone can enjoy. Especially interesting are the accounts of circuses in the
                    state of Indiana, specifically the town of <placeName>
                        <country reg="pe">Peru</country>
                    </placeName>, which so many companies used for their winter quarters and which perpetuates the charm
                    of the circus to this day.</p>
            <p>The book opens with a brief and lively history of the circus from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rome</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s Circus Maximus to today's so-called Shrine Circuses. There are many
                    familiar names in this section, which outlines the careers <pb n="241" id="VAA4025-097-3-079"/> of
                    movers and shakers like P. T. Barnum, James Bailey, Clyde Beatty, and John Ringling. Other names
                    important to the development of the circus are not so familiar. For example, one learns about
                    William Cameron Coup, a native of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>,
                            <country reg="inu">Indiana</country>
               </placeName>, who contributed significantly to circus
                    travel by inventing a process of loading trains with circus equipment that greatly streamlined the
                    movement of the circus from place to place. He also perfected the technique of plastering the
                    countryside with gaudy posters to whet the appetites of prospective customers.</p>
            <p>Some of these posters are wonderfully reproduced here, and they alone are worth the price of the
                    book. A glowering hippo (p. 8), a striking clown (p. 55), and a supremely confident Frank Buck
                    amidst a jungle menagerie (p. 44) are among the most exciting examples. Unfortunately no mention is
                    made of the approximate dates of these posters. An excellent photo of downtown
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Greensburg</settlement>, <country reg="inu">Indiana</country>
               </placeName>, (p. 17) gives us an idea of how these posters were used. It is
                    obvious that the advance advertising was overwhelming in those more innocent times. When the
                    photograph of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Greensburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> was taken in August 1907 there was no radio or television, and movies were just
                    beginning to catch on. The circus was the big event in entertainment for small towns like <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Sharon L. Smith and Stephen J. Fletcher relate stories and interviews that are of great interest. For
                    example, this reader was quite taken with the story of Lilian Leitzel, who appeared in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1914; her act consisted of "a never-before-seen stunt, the one-armed
                    flange, for which she separated her shoulder joint again and again, throwing her entire body
                    vertically over her shoulder." According to Smith, Leitzel commanded top billing longer
                    than any other circus performer in history.</p>
            <p>Gilbert Taylor, presently curator of the Crispus Attucks Museum in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, was interviewed about his father, Hugh Taylor, who was a trombonist with the
                    Hagenback-Wallace Circus in the 1920s. Taylor tells what the life of an African American traveling
                    with the circus was like. He recalled that his father reported that black performers were not
                    treated differently in the circus, but with townspeople it was a different story.</p>
            <p>The book closes with an episode concerning the antics of a female elephant named Modoc that bolted
                    during a performance at the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> (Indiana) High School gymnasium in 1942. Modoc caused considerable consternation around
                    the countryside for about four days before she was effectively corralled.</p>
            <p>This is a valuable and entertaining book.</p>

            <p>A quarter of a century ago the anthropologist Noel William Schutz, Jr., lamented that the Shawnee
                    Indians had been neglected by scholars. Today their significance is still widely underappreciated.
                    The memory of Tecumseh, it is true, remains a durable monument to Shawnee enterprise, but long
                    before his rise on the eve of the War of 1812 Shawnees were acknowledged pan-Indian diplomats. As
                    John Norton, an adopted Mohawk, testified in 1804, the tribe was recognized as "the most
                    leading nation of the [Indian] Confederacy—most polished in their language &amp;
                    manners &amp; those who convene the Councils &amp; bring the rest together" (p.
                    352). Shawnees orchestrated resistance to the white settlement of the Old Northwest over a period of
                    seventy years, and their influence filtered deep into the South, spurring the Cherokee war of 1776
                    and the Seminole and Creek uprisings of 1812–1814.</p>
            <p>However, apart from their stand for <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>,
                            <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, and Indiana, Shawnees commonly
                    responded to pressure by migrating, and their extraordinary peregrinations partly explain the lack
                    of an adequate modern history of the tribe. Ranging widely between <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <country reg="mx">Mexico</country>
                    </placeName>, the Shawnees left source materials that are scattered and difficult to marshal. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Randolph</settlement>
                    </placeName> Noe's excellent bibliography, which describes nearly three thousand published
                    references, reflects this rich past. The extensive indices allow students to pursue selected themes,
                    but the references are grouped around chronological time periods and demonstrate the uneven scope of
                    the writing. Most treat the tribe's occupancy of the <geogName>Ohio Valley</geogName>
                    before "removal" in the 1830s, but while the experiences of the emigrant
                    communities in <placeName>

               </placeName>, and elsewhere now attract attention, research on
                    twentieth-century Shawnee history remains depressingly thin.</p>
            <p>The great strength of this book is its comprehensiveness. Nearly all the pertinent items are here,
                    along with many little-known articles and dissertations, and most scholars will make discoveries
                    among these gleanings. Inevitably, in a work of such scope, there are some omissions. The
                    biographies of Clark, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>, and Harrison, respectively written by James A. James, Paul David Nelson, and Dorothy
                    B. Goebel, ought to have found a place, while Carl J. Fliegel's index of the Moravian
                    records details essential Shawnee documents. The most striking omission is the <hi rend="i">Atlas of
                        Great Lakes Indian History</hi>, edited by Helen H. Tanner and published in 1987. Given the
                    confusing movements of Shawnee communities in the colonial and early national periods, this is an
                    essential reference. However, there are surprisingly few oversights, and the listing of such legal
                    documents as statutes at large and executive orders is particularly thorough.</p>
            <pb n="243" id="VAA4025-097-3-081"/>
            <p>If there is a criticism, it is that the evaluation of sources might have had a sharper edge. Much
                    that has been written about the Shawnees is unreliable. For example, Thomas Wildcat
                    Alford's description of the responsibilities of the different divisions of the Shawnee
                    tribe is not applicable to the eighteenth century. The Mekoche division, not the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chillicothe</settlement>
                    </placeName> or Hathawekela, managed tribal affairs, and Alford's much repeated errors (pp.
                    xix-xx) have led to serious misinterpretations of Shawnee politics. To his credit, Noe usually
                    cautions readers about questionable sources, and some notorious examples of fraudulent writing have
                    wisely been omitted altogether.</p>
            <p>Quibbles aside, this conscientious, wide-ranging, and valuable volume is a mandatory first stop for
                    any student of the Shawnee. What we now need is a balanced history of the tribe—that one
                    hopes Noe will undertake—and the restoration of these people to their rightful place in
                    American history.</p>

               <hi rend="i">A Fragile Capital</hi> offers a broad description of the origins and forty years of
                    development of the capital city of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. In addition, it describes the process of creating a new city to serve as the capital
                    of the state. Unlike most local historians, Charles C. Cole, Jr., does not just follow a
                    chronological description of the happenings in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName> from 1812 until 1850. Rather, the book is organized by topic, including business,
                    politics, education, religion, the arts, transportation, and the press. This arrangement opens the
                    possibility of penetrating the background in depth, which the author accomplishes.</p>
            <p>Cole relies on primary sources such as letters, diaries, legal documents, and newspapers, rather than
                    depending, as so many local historians do, on folklore and other informal sources. While the use of
                    primary sources tends to emphasize white male leaders, the author has also worked to uncover
                    evidence about the role of women and the antislavery efforts in political activity.</p>
            <p>Change is the theme of the capital city's first four decades. The impact of the improvement
                    in highways and railroad building and their effect upon the mobility of the people of central <placeName>

                    </placeName> is explored. Cole analyzes the increase in writing and publishing and illustrates that
                    cultural opportunities in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName> expanded during this period, by mid-century attracting internationally known performers
                    such as Swedish soprano Jenny Lind.</p>

            <p>The number of <placeName>

                    </placeName> residents who were abolitionists was very small, but Cole conducts distinctive research
                    in this area, offering a detailed analysis of the antislavery issue's influence on politics
                    in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the state of <placeName>

            <p>Indiana readers will note many similarities between the pioneer period in their own state and that of
                    their <placeName>

                    River</geogName>; both established early capitals in the southern part of their territory; and later
                    both chose a more central location for their state's capital city. Cole's use of
                    the term "fragile capital" reflects the political compromises required to create a
                    new city for the state capital and the turbulent changes in the pioneer period that threatened its
                    permanence.</p>
            <p>This book should be attractive to the general public as well as professional historians. Teachers and
                    librarians seeking a reference on early nineteenth-century life in what was then considered
                    "the west" will appreciate Cole's in-depth descriptions of specific areas
                    as well as his more general discussions. Cole's work reflects an extended period of
                    research and will be appreciated by lay readers as much as by professional historians.</p>

                    work of pioneers in the practice of landscape architecture in the Midwest: George Edward Kessler
                    designed the park and parkway systems of the three Indiana cities, and the Olmsted Brothers firm was
                    responsible for the campus development of the 1930s that adjoins the Old Crescent. Percival
                    Gallagher, the Olmsted Brothers designer responsible for the firm's work at Indiana
                    University, single-handedly saved Dunn's Woods from development! Kessler, the senior
                    Olmsted, and the Olmsted Brothers are included in <hi rend="i">Midwestern Landscape
                    Architecture</hi>, edited by William H. Tishler, who is a member of the department of landscape

            <pb n="245" id="VAA4025-097-3-083"/>
            <p>This book is a scholarly collection of profiles of the careers of pioneers in landscape architecture
                    in the Midwest states of <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>, <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>,

                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName>, with references to the practitioners' projects in Indiana. The thirteen
                    profiles present the careers of eleven landscape architects (two of them women), one architect, and
                    a horticulturalist.</p>
            <p>The careers of these professionals are presented by a talented group of scholars, including eight
                    faculty members and administrators in landscape architecture, a preservation planner, two editors of
                    scholarly publications in landscape architecture history, an architect, a landscape architect, and a
                    landscape historian. They have meticulously researched biographies, professional careers, and
                    projects. They have become the "alter-egos" of these gallant crusaders for
                    appreciation of the midwestern landscape and its natural heritage.</p>
            <p>While most of the practitioners included in this book are not widely known (Frederick Law Olmsted and
                    Jens Jensen are the exceptions), the authors want to introduce them to a broad readership. Their
                    work spans the 130-year period between 1852—the beginning of the career of Adolph
                    Strauch, the "Father" of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s Spring Grove Cemetery—and the death of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> landscape architect and conservationist Genevieve Gillette in 1986. Each chapter
                    summarizes an individual's role in midwestern landscape architecture, offers biographical
                    highlights, discusses key innovative projects, assesses contributions to the profession of landscape
                    architecture, and notes the extent of recognition of his or her work by peers, professional
                    organizations, and clients. The chapters are filled with plan drawings, photos, correspondence, and
                    interviews with colleagues, mentors, and family members. Many charming anecdotes are included, not
                    only in the chapter text, but also in extensive footnotes.</p>
            <p>The impact of these professionals is staggering. They provided innovative ideas in the design of
                    cemeteries, parks, playgrounds, parkways, and park systems (for cities, regions, and states),
                    residential subdivisions, and residential gardens. This book promotes interest in the protection of
                    regional landscapes and opens the door for further research, as did Cynthia Zaitzevsky's

               <hi rend="i">"Rally, Once Again": Selected Civil War Writings of Alan T.
                    Nolan.</hi> By Alan T. Nolan. (<placeName>

                    </placeName> House Publishers, 2000. Pp. x, 308. Illustrations, notes, index. $29.95.)</head>
            <p>Alan T. Nolan here presents a self-described "late in career vanity piece." It is a
                    compendium of various writings, most of them previously published. Nolan is a fine scholar, though
                    not a professional historian (he practices law). While he expresses strong and controversial
                    opinions, he makes a good case for them.</p>
            <p>Nolan has divided the work into four major divisions: 1) leaders, which focuses mostly on Robert E.
                    Lee but also treats Abraham <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>, John Gibbon, and Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, 2) <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>, 3) the Iron Brigade; and 4) selected reviews. Nolan points out that he "was
                    introduced to the war as a child on a trip to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Antietam</settlement>
                    </placeName>" with his "history-loving father," who also told him about
                    his "Irish Civil War grandfather" (p. ix). Nolan claims to have been
                    "studying, writing, talking and thinking about the war for sixty years," and he
                    does "not see the war as at all romantic or glorious." Placing himself squarely as
                    a-not-likely-to-be-well-received person in many places, especially in the South, Nolan finds
                    "all of the contentions of the Southern myth of the Lost Cause … offensive
                    … and unhistoric." Instead, he puts himself in the camp of the current chief
                    historian of the National Park Service when he says that "In fact, slavery <hi rend="i">was</hi> the source of the sectional conflict"—a view that, when unqualified,
                    is challenged by most historians. He also rejects as absurd "the romantic cliche that
                    ‘both sides were right’…." He almost invites the ire and
                    rage of some readers by concluding, "In short, except for the valor of Confederate common
                    soldiers, I find almost nothing in the Confederate culture or tradition to admire or
                    celebrate" (p. x).</p>
            <p>As to Lee's "greatness" as a general, Nolan's position is summed
                    up with his opening statement "I believe that Lee's generalship hurt the
                    Confederates' chances for victory" (p. 10). Indeed, Nolan clearly reveals that he
                    is much more a critic than an admirer of Lee. Nolan departs widely from the view of most historians
                    when he asserts that Lee was sure that the South's loss was inevitable by June of 1864, ten
                    months before <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Appomattox</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Recent scholarship has indicated that evidence shows Lee did not decide that the war
                    was lost until sometime after the first of January 1865 and probably not until well into February.</p>
            <p>About <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Nolan believes "the first day and its decisiveness in reference to the
                    outcome of the battle are not sufficiently emphasized in much of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> literature" (p. 141). Certainly fans of Thomas J.
                    "Stonewall" Jackson would agree: if only Old Jack had been at the base of
                    Culp's Hill on July 1, 1863, Lee's orders to secure those heights " if
                    practicable" would (supposedly) most assuredly have been carried out. Nolan also asserts
                    that "the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <pb n="247" id="VAA4025-097-3-085"/> campaign involved substantial and unacceptable risks for
                    Lee's army" (p. 157).</p>
            <p>Nolan has made a major hobby out of writing pieces on the Iron Brigade. His various contributions are
                    significant and noteworthy, but especially impressive is his short piece, "Giants in Tall
                    Black Hats."</p>
            <p>The section on book reviews is very good. For one thing, it shows just how broad is the range of
                    Nolan's careful and critical reading. While many readers may be acquainted with the work
                    Nolan has reviewed, few will have seen Nolan's published critiques, since he has written
                    for widely varied publications. "his work is everything that reasonably might have been
                    hoped for or expected.</p>

            <p>"The working class had its own geniuses, though they are seldom celebrated," writes
                    historian James R. Barrett. William Z. Foster, who organized <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s packinghouse workers and led 1919's Great Steel Strike, in his own
                    sphere "was every bit as cosmopolitan and sophisticated as the corporate strategists he
                    loved to battle" (p. ix). Indeed, Foster stands among the giants of the left in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Had indigenous Communists selected their leader democratically, they certainly would
                    have chosen him, and Barrett explains why in a compelling analysis. From Foster's
                    "young adulthood on, class conflict was not simply an element of theory, but the central
                    experience" in life, from which all else developed. "Even in his
                    fifties," Foster "worried far less about confrontations with the police than other
                    Communist leaders did. He seldom advocated violence, but he seemed to accept its prospect as a
                    matter of course" (p. 178).</p>
            <p>Barrett's account contributes much to a field of study in which historiographical disputes
                    often seem likely to spill into street battles. In examining Foster's life and career,
                    Barrett employs both domestic and Russian sources to strike a refreshing balance between focus on
                    "the genuine radical impulses generated by social conflict in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>" and emphasis on "the exigencies of international Communist politics,
                    particularly the policy interests of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-xxr">Soviet Union</country>

            <p>Foster, who was reared in a <placeName>

                    </placeName> slum and forced early into unskilled labor to help support his family, obtained his
                    education <pb n="248" id="VAA4025-097-3-086"/> on the open road. He hoboed to most parts of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> looking for employment and worked on tramp steamers that took him to Africa, <placeName>
                        <country reg="at">Australia</country>
                    </placeName>, and Latin America. He advocated socialism, joined the Industrial Workers of the World,
                    and then studied syndicalism and foreign languages in Britain, <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>. Although Foster clearly possessed more gifts than most of his contemporaries in the
                    movement, his final ideological journey, from syndicalism to communism, typified "a whole
                    generation of labor radicals, men and women who made the ideological leap in faith that the
                    Communist Party represented a more suitable vehicle for achieving a working-class
                    revolution" (p. 197). Barrett argues that the movement's failure to achieve a more
                    egalitarian American society resulted from a complex dynamic of bad Communist party decisions and
                    government repression.</p>
            <p>In telling Foster's exciting story, Barrett displays an insight applicable to other top
                    Communists as well. "It would be difficult to analyze Foster's own development as
                    distinct from … organizations he helped shape, because his identity had <hi rend="i">merged</hi> with these movements" [emphasis in original]. "The paucity of
                    personal material … reflects Foster's personality as much as a dearth of
                    sources" (p. x). His individuality became "fused with his politics." To
                    "disengage the two" would be "misleading and artificial" (p.
                    xi). Decades earlier, contemporaries Elizabeth G. Flynn, Joseph Freeman, and Steve Nelson made
                    observations that support Barrett's point (pp. 203, 241).</p>
            <p>If commitment to the class struggle was Foster's strength, distrust of democracy was his
                    weakness. When he was a Syndicalist, Foster wanted "facts and figures" to replace
                    the capitalists. "These would be interpreted and executed not by rank-and-file workers, but
                    by technical experts in each industry" (p. 56). As a Communist, Foster always sought rule
                    by a Leninist vanguard, not a mass toilers' party. After Nikita Khrushchev's
                    "secret speech" caused other American Communists to reconsider their
                    movement's entire nature, Foster continued to defend Joseph Stalin.</p>

            <p>In the very last paragraph of this fascinating labor history of baseball, Robert F. Burk writes of
                    the "contentious history … [and] the <pb n="249" id="VAA4025-097-3-087"/>
                    self-destructive hatreds" of team owners and major league baseball players that has
                    characterized the sport from its beginnings in the nineteenth century to the present (p. 312).</p>
            <p>Burk, a professor of history and chair of his department at Muskingum College in New Concord, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, began charting baseball's labor woes in <hi rend="i">Never Just a Game:
                        Players, Owners, &amp; American Baseball to 1920</hi> (1994), and he continues his detailed
                    narrative in this book, dividing the last eighty years into "The Paternalistic Era: The Age
                    of Rickey," and "The Inflationary Era: The Age of Miller."</p>
            <p>His division makes sense, as does his selection of Branch Rickey and Marvin Miller as the two most
                    influential figures in his story. Although baseball commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis presided
                    over the sport from 1921 to 1944, Burk punctures Landis's importance—much of it
                    self-importance—and shows that Rickey, in his perfection of the farm system and his
                    relentless cost efficiency, was the main force in baseball from the late 1920s through the 1950s.
                    Rickey was also the master of paternalistic labor practices, including his most famous
                    action—the racial integration of organized baseball with his signing of Jackie Robinson,
                    first to a minor league contract and then to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brooklyn</settlement>
                    </placeName> Dodgers. Burk argues persuasively that Rickey acted more from economic interests than
                    racial idealism. The clever executive saw African American players and their Negro leagues as an
                    untapped pool of cheap labor for his and other major league teams, and he signed Robinson mainly
                    because he wanted to demolish incipient player unionization as well as a possible competitor to
                    major league monopoly, the Mexican league. In this action and many others, Rickey shaped organized
                    baseball into a cartel that maximized profits for owners, particularly the bosses of the Dodgers and
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> Yankees, and kept player salaries at an amazingly low level.</p>
            <p>Rickey's triumph prepared the way for the 1960s Player Association and its hiring of an
                    experienced labor union official, Marvin Miller, to press salary and pension demands. The
                    intransigence and stupidity of the team owners allowed Miller to maneuver the sport into 1970s free
                    agency and its subsequent consequences—a relatively open market that allows veteran
                    players, particularly stars, to sell themselves to the highest bidder for fabulous sums of money.
                    During the Rickey era, the average major league salary never topped $15,000, and player
                    payroll consumed a minor percentage of team operating costs; now, on many teams, average salaries
                    are at the $1.5 million mark, and total player payroll far exceeds the book value of the
                    franchise.</p>
            <p>Burk tells this story well, drawing upon many sources and transforming his research into a highly
                    readable narrative. He also adds a long "Bibliographic Essay" on the literature of
                    baseball history, treating the many sentimental paeans to the sport, including ones by fellow
                    historians, with a kindness that they do not deserve and that <pb n="250" id="VAA4025-097-3-088"/>
                    is undercut by his own clear-eyed view of what actually occurred, particularly between players and
                    owners. After finishing <hi rend="i">Much More than a Game</hi> and its predecessor, <hi rend="i">Never Just a Game</hi>, no reader will be able to swallow another essay by an Ivy League
                    academic treating the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Red Sox as if they were cursed heroes of Greek mythology. For this gift and his superb
                    labor history of baseball, serious fans of the sport should give Burk a standing ovation.</p>
