            Indiana and Its History
            WILLIAM O. LYNCH
            The name Indiana means Indian country. The term was first applied by a trading
                    company to a geographic district just east of the upper 
                        Ohio
                     between the Monongahela and Little Kanawha rivers. A few years
                    later, in 1800, the same name was given to the vast northern and western portions of the Northwest
                    Territory. No state carries a more appropriate name than does Indiana. It is a name comparable to
                        
                        
                            Pennsylvania
                        
                     and likewise to Westsylvania and Transylvania, the last
                    two being historic appellations that would fitly designate West 
                        Virginia
                     and 
                        Kentucky
                    , respectively. It was but a brief span of years until Indiana Territory, whittled down
                    to much smaller dimensions, became a state. The frontier community then admitted to the Union on an
                    equality with the eighteen states already in, has experienced many changes in the century and a
                    quarter since 1816.
            Reaching from Lake Michigan to the 
                        Ohio
                    , Indiana lies athwart the many lines of traffic, travel, and communication that cross
                    the country between the chain of great inland seas and the greatest eastern tributary of the 
                        Mississippi
                    . Irvin S. Cobb, in that one of his Guyed Books which he devoted to
                    Indiana, described the Hoosier State as the "in-betweener of three great states [
                        Ohio
                     and 
                        Illinois
                     were the other two] which go sprawling across the same parallels having the
                        Ohio River as their common border on the South and stretching northward,
                    all three of them, to the Great Lakes." The meaning of the strategic location of Indiana is
                    that the state cannot escape being influenced profoundly by the ceaseless flow of ideas and goods
                    across its confines from East to West and West to East. The similar North-South lines have never
                    occupied the highly important position  of the East-West lines,
                    one result of which has been that sectional cleavages have been far more marked between northern and
                    southern than between eastern and western portions of the commonwealth.
            Indiana has no mountain area, but the Allegheny Plateau extends across the 
                        Ohio
                    , furnishing southern 
                        Ohio
                     and much of southern Indiana with rough areas. This carved-up, low plateau country is
                    quite wide on the eastern side of Indiana, its northern edge running southwestward and reaching the 
                        Ohio
                     above 
                        Evansville
                    . To say this another way, the Ohio River does not run along the
                    outer, lower edge of the Allegheny Plateau but holds a position on that plateau from 
                        Pittsburgh
                     to a point between 
                        Louisville
                     and 
                        Evansville
                    . At 
                        Cincinnati
                    , a few miles above the mouth of the Big Miami, the 
                        Ohio
                     bluffs are quite formidable, as they are at all points to 
                        Louisville
                     and beyond, though conspicuously absent at 
                        Evansville
                     and below. The hills of southeastern Indiana and those which extend from 
                        Monroe
                     and 
                        Brown
                     counties southward to the 
                        Ohio
                     add variety, color, and romance to the state. The scenes that present themselves to the
                    observer from the top of a ridge in the "Hoosier Alps" are not essentially
                    different in appearance from hundreds that may be found in the plateau areas of the Appalachians or
                    the Ozarks.
            The great central region of Indiana is more gently rolling, being rugged only in the vicinity of
                    river bluffs. This irregular middle country is drained by the 
                        Wabash
                     and its tributaries, the greatest of which is the White River,
                    formed by the union of two branches, East Fork and West Fork, on the northern edge of 
                        Pike County
                    . The greater part of the state south of the 
                        Wabash
                     is drained into the 
                        Wabash
                     by the White River, through its two branches and their
                    tributaries. The Indiana streams that reach the 
                        Ohio
                     directly between the mouths of the Big Miami and the 
                        Wabash
                     are relatively short, and few Hoosiers living in areas other than the belt along the 
                        Ohio
                     know the names of any of them.
            The northern part of Indiana is flatter, river bluffs are low or wanting, and the continental divide
                    which can be traced across it is observed only by those who take the trouble to look for it with
                    care. The principal river of northeastern Indiana is the Maumee, which is formed by the junction of
                    the St. Mary with the 
                        St. Joseph
                    . Ft. Wayne is located at the point of union. Usually, when two rivers join  to form another, the resulting stream takes the direction of one or the
                    other or follows an intermediate line. The Maumee is a pronounced non-conformist, since it takes off
                    in an opporsite direction from that naturally expected, almost bisecting the acute angle formed by
                    the two streams that join to create it, as it flows northeastward towards Lake 
                        Erie
                    . The central portion of northern Indiana is drained by the 
                        Tippecanoe
                    , which flows southward to the 
                        Wabash
                    , and the 
                        Elkhart
                    , which joins the 
                        St. Joseph
                     of the Lake at a point within the city of 
                        Elkhart
                    . The Kankakee once drained or tried to drain the flat marshy district of northwestern
                    Indiana, its waters reaching the 
                        Mississippi
                     by way of the Illinois River system. The expression,
                    "tried to drain," is employed advisedly, since it required an immense amount of
                    dredging before the sluggish Kankakee and its equally sluggish tributaries were able to function
                    successfully. Even after success was attained by the persistent aid of man and at considerable
                    expense, the results were not entirely satisfactory; considerable portions of the once world-famous
                    swamps of the Kankakee, that attracted sportsmen from far and wide, including some from
                    across' the Atlantic, have been restored.
            Northern Indiana and most of the central part of the state lie in the glaciated area, a fact which
                    has exerted a marked influence on the economic life and development of that region. Much but not all
                    of the state was originally heavily forested. Lakes abound in various parts of Indiana's
                    glaciated country, and in recent years a number of remarkable artificial lakes have been created in
                    hill regions.
            Extensive coal deposits occupy a long triangular district of the southwestern part of the
                    commonwealth, the base of the triangle resting on the 
                        Ohio
                     with the apex near the 
                        Illinois
                     boundary, not far north of the southward turn in the 
                        Wabash
                    . Soils of great variety are found over the more than 36,000 square miles that lie
                    within the boundaries of Indiana. There is a considerable variation in the winters and summers of
                    northern, middle, and southern Indiana. All parts of the state are, however, subject to visitations
                    of cold waves, heat waves, droughts, and short periods or even seasons marked by too much rainfall.
                    It can be asserted, nevertheless, with no fear of successful contradiction, that Indiana comprises
                    an area highly favored by nature in fertile soil, fuels, climate, location, and scenery. If a
                    wonderful civilization has not  been built or cannot be built,
                    in Hoosierland, certainly the reasons must be found in the people or in the influencing factors that
                    lie outside its boundaries. It must be admitted at once, as a matter of course, that the development
                    of Indiana has been profoundly affected by natural conditions, by the capacity of her citizens, and
                    by outside influences, among which should be stressed the significant events and changes that have
                    occurred in the remainder of the 
                        United States
                     and in the world at large.
            Indiana may not have started on a shoestring but she surely started from scratch. In 1800 there was
                    nothing but virgin land, forests and prairie, with untouched resources and a meagre Indian
                    population. In 1816, when statehood was conferred, the territorial census takers could count less
                    than 64,000 men, women, and children, excluding Indians. Statehood being greatly desired, it is safe
                    to say that the reported number was not too small. At the moment of admission to the Union with all
                    of the privileges of existing states, the people of Indiana occupied a belt about thirty-five miles
                    wide along the Ohio River, plus a narrow strip along the western line of 
                        Ohio
                     southward from 
                        Richmond
                     and a few settlements along the 
                        Wabash
                     northward to 
                        Terre Haute
                    . Politically Indiana ceased to be a colony of the 
                        United States
                     in 1816, but economically and socially it remained a colony of the older states for
                    several decades. The pioneer stage came later in each successive area as the edge of settlement
                    advanced northward and northwestward; but in some of the newer sections pioneering was completed
                    more rapidly. The dates for first settlements are not safe guides in regard to the length of the
                    pioneer stage in different parts of the state. In a number of counties in southern and central
                    Indiana, frontier life remained long after its characteristics had disappeared from counties formed
                    later and located farther northward. Indeed, pioneer ways, homes, and roads may still be observed in
                    out-of-the-way Hoosier neighborhoods.
            As was true in older belts to the eastward and southeastward, colonized before Indiana, and of the
                    whole wide and wonderful drainage basin of the 
                        Mississippi
                    , some of which was colonized simultaneously with Indiana while other portions were
                    settled earlier or later, there was the opportunity to construct a civilization in Hoosierland where
                    none had existed before. Like those who came to other parts of vacant  America, however, the people who established institutional life in
                    Indiana did not create a new order. It is well known that 
                        men and women are by nature averse to experimentation when developing political, economic and
                            social institutions even when free to go the limit. That this has been widely recognized is
                            proved by the fact that whenever and wherever groups of people have tried to establish
                            communities unlike the prevailing type, they have been regarded as cranks and their
                            communities as unique but impossible. Even colonies that were founded in order to establish
                            a new religious faith or a new kind of government were generally quite thoroughly orthodox
                            in regard to everything else.
                        Most pioneer men and women preserved every tradition, every habit and every method of doing
                            the ordinary things of everyday life that it was possible to retain from making a garden and
                            baking bread to conducting weddings and funerals. Human beings are very prone to cling to
                            what they are accustomed to, and pioneer men and women who did not know frontier life until
                            after they were mature changed their ways mainly from necessity, not from
                                choice….1
                  
                    
            
            In general, the colonization of Indiana was pretty well completed by 1860. Most of the lands of the
                    state were reduced to private ownership within the preceding half century. The counties of the state
                    were formed in that period. Lands were cleared and towns and villages grew up. Local and state
                    governments were developed, following closely the patterns furnished by older states. Churches
                    dotted the land and a few colleges were established. Facilities for general education came very
                    slowly. The system of common schools supported by public taxation, in which there has been such a
                    great and justifiable pride, did not come into existence until after the Civil War; but a veritable
                    miracle was performed by Hoosiers in the few years intervening between 1873 and 1890. In this
                    remarkably brief period, the free public school system of Indiana was created, including many of the
                    high schools. It is doubtful whether any civilized community has ever done anything of such high
                    value so quickly and so well.
            It is well known that there was a large flow of southerners to Indiana during the early decades of
                    statehood. This does not mean that the South generally contributed heavily to this migrating tide,
                    the truth being that very nearly all of

                     the southerners who came hailed from 
                  Virginia, Kentucky
               , and 
                        North Carolina
                    , with only a sprinkling from other southern states. As the years went by, more and more
                    colonists streamed into Indiana from 
                        Pennsylvania
                     and 
                        Ohio
                    , the stream of colonists from these states being larger than that from the South
                    between 1850 and 1860. Contrary to a common opinion, 
                        New York
                     and the New 
                        England
                     states furnished very few colonists to Indiana, though these particular areas

                    , and 
                        Iowa
                    . True, Indiana received considerable numbers of New Englanders and New Yorkers of the
                    second or third generation, especially by way of 
                        Ohio
                    , but few came directly or after stopovers in intervening states. It is also a fact of
                    significance that Indiana received few colonists of foreign birth before 1860. 
                        Ohio
                    , 
                        Michigan
                    , 
                        Illinois
                    , and 
                        Wisconsin
                     each received far larger foreign elements than did Indiana during the period of
                    colonization as well as since. The comparatively small movement of foreign-born elements into
                    Indiana became a fact of real importance. Though a negative influence, it has had a great deal to do
                    with the rather marked differentiation of Indiana from 
                        Ohio
                    , 
                        Michigan
                    , 
                        Illinois
                    , and 
                        Wisconsin
                    , which has developed since the earlier period of colonization.
            A keen student of social and political progress, standing in Indiana in any of the closing years of
                    the pioneer period, might well have prophesied a happy future for the state—one with
                    opportunities open to all with freedom from want practically universal. Before the Civil War came,
                    Indiana had a large population and a place in the sun. In the national House of Representatives, she
                    had caught up with 
                        Massachusetts
                    , which meant that, in the decade preceding 1860 only 
                  New York, Pennsylvania
               , 
                        Virginia
                    , and 
                        Ohio
                     outnumbered Indiana in the lower branch of Congress or stood ahead of her in the number
                    of presidential electors. In agriculture, transportation, trade, and the professions, the state was
                    on the up-grade.2 Dissatisfied citizens with ambition could go to newer states
                    where there were beckoning opportunities, and multitudes were taking advantage of this 
                  
                     2 By the decade of the eighteefi-fifties, the population of Indiana
                            had increased so rapidly that only 
                                New York
                            , 
                                Pennsylvania
                            , 
                                Virginia
                            , and 
                                Ohio
                             could boast more members of the lower branch of Congress, while 
                                Massachusetts
                             had an equal number. This meant a powerful position in presidential contests on
                            account of the number of electors. In the same decade, Indiana arose to first position in
                            hog production and second in wheat. At the opening of the Civil War, the Hoosier State
                            certainly held no mean place in the "kingdom of wheat and bacon."
               
                     outlet. Though large numbers were still migrating to Indiana in
                    the eighteen-fifties, hosts of colonists were leaving the state, most of them going to
                            
                  Illinois, Iowa
               , and 
                        Missouri
                    . It was in this decade that the struggle for 
                        Kansas
                     was taking place, but this did not mean that there was a heavy migration to that scene
                    of conflict. In fact, the mighty flow of colonists to the West from older areas of the North and
                    South and from Europe between 1850 and 1860 was not greatly affected by the small migration into 
                        Kansas
                    . Southerners, northerners, and foreigners went to attractive frontier areas other than 
                        Kansas
                     which offered better opportunities. These inviting areas included 
                  Texas, Arkansas,
                            Missouri, Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan, Iowa
               , and
                    even 
                        Minnesota
                     and 
                        California
                    .3 Though migrating Hoosiers for the most part avoided distracted 
                        Kansas
                    , nevertheless, Indiana, 
                        Ohio
                    , and 
                        Illinois
                     each contributed more colonists to that remote territory than did either
                            
                  New York, Pennsylvania
               , or the six New 
                        England
                     states combined, while these three older states of the Old Northwest together sent more
                    colonists to 
                        Kansas
                     during the dramatic struggle than the total furnished by all the slaveholding
                        states.4
            
            The boom years following in the wake of Lee's surrender, that were marked by crooked
                    business and accompanied by crooked politics, were succeeded by a panic and hard times. The
                    depression was over in a few years, but it brought disillusionment to many people. The Middle West
                    had been a region of plenty with advancing population, developing institutions, growing towns,
                    better transportation, and increasing wealth. Leaders who looked below the surface had reason to be
                    discouraged. The fortunes that were accumulated during the war and the ensuing prosperous years were
                    beyond anything known prior to 1860, while the power of wealth resting in the hands of limited
                    numbers, with the masses facing unexpected problems and living none too well, disturbed all who took
                    time out to think on the situation. It was only natural that questions should often occur to
                    dissatisfied farmers, struggling small-business men, and the increasing number of laborers with no
                    property who depended solely on the wages of the day at hand. The question was hard to frame, but in
                    essence it represented a widespread

                     anxiety lest the boasted economic system of the American
                    Republic resting on the unlimited resources of the country was in practice falling far short of its
                    promises.
            The truth was that Indiana, like the rest of the country, was in the early stage of a long transition
                    period produced by the coming of the industrial revolution. The pioneer period with its seeming
                    guarantee of not only political democracy but a large degree of economic equality, at least equality
                    of opportunity for all, had not ended until the new regime of the industrial revolution swept in and
                    over one community after another. The South struggling through the long troubled years of political
                    reconstruction and economic rehabilitation, did not face the problems of the new industrial regime
                    so early, but to Indiana, as to the rest of the North and West, the age of transition came too
                    promptly. Stating the case somewhat figuratively, the industrial revolution slipped up on the blind
                    side of America, in the guise of an unmixed blessing, and was welcomed and accepted before it was
                    understood. In a country guided by the principle of laissez faire in regard to
                    about everything except the protective tariff, perhaps nothing else could have been expected. The
                    development of the new industrial regime was permitted to go on with but feeble attempts to direct
                    or regulate it for a number of years. Those who cried out against it were but voices in the
                    wilderness. Conservatives all over the nation, those of Indiana marching in the front ranks, adopted
                    an easy way to avoid responsibility. They simply held that the only danger to prosperity and
                    happiness consisted in doctrines of political demagogues and other agitators who persisted in
                    proclaiming that there were great wrongs to be righted. Repudiate the "calamity
                    howlers" and all would be well. This benighted idea still prevails widely as a substitute
                    for grappling with actual conditions. Any one who cares to take time can count plenty of
                    conservative leaders of ability, not confined to one party, on both sides of 1900, who conformed to
                    this pattern. This mark of the conservative leadership of Indiana would not be noticed here but for
                    the conviction that so few intelligent citizens of the state feel any concern in regard to it.
                    Indeed, any Hoosier liberal is justified in the fear that his beloved state will continue to accept
                    and follow conservative leadership while crucifying progressives.
            It must be admitted that Indiana conservatives are pronounced worshipers at the shrines of liberals,
                    who have acted fearlessly in past crises and emergencies, but the sad part  of it all is that these ardent friends of outstanding advocates of
                    change who have been dead for some time fail to catch the spirit of their departed heroes and, God
                    help them, do not know that they so fail. The most baffling thing confronting liberals in Indiana is
                    the difficulty of reaching the minds of the mass of intelligent citizens. Surely he is a friend of
                    the state who hopes and prays that such a condition may not continue to prevail, since indifference
                    is an efficient promoter of deterioration. In other words, there are two kinds of decay with which
                    those who observe carefully are familiar. Anyone can recognize the condition of a rotten cabbage or
                    tree, but there is also a dry-rot, no less sure in its results, that is not easily seen. Citizens of
                    Indiana have often refused to look for the evidence of this species of decay, or to heed the
                    menacing message when pointed out. No one can demonstrate that Indiana has not had a history of
                    which her citizens may feel proud, but it seems equally clear that the reactions of her people to
                    the grave problems of the last seventy-five years, which have been so largely economic, have often
                    not been based on deep insight or clear vision.
            The structure of civilization which has been erected in Indiana during her brief history is not
                    essentially different from that in other states of the Union. If anything, Hoosiers have been too
                    prone to conform to the general pattern, rather than to draft new blue-prints and try them out. It
                    has been hard to realize that wisdom cannot always lie with elements who regard experimentation with
                    horror; yet there can be no progress without the courage to venture on new paths. It is never safe
                    for any people to decide that the existing order is entirely sacred and that it must be maintained
                    intact. The foolishness of such an idea is manifest when one thinks of how many seemingly solid
                    historic institutions have disappeared as the centuries have passed. When it is brought to mind that
                    the present industrial set-up, with its colossal capital, armies of laborers, and accompanying
                    financial structure of gigantic proportions, is as yet very young, it should be readily understood
                    that defects are natural. It seems axiomatic that the only sound principle is to admit the defects
                    and remove them as promptly and painlessly as possible.
            It is not the contention that Indiana can do much by herself to remake the country or the world. It
                    is believed to be a sound and sane argument, nevertheless, that the people of Indiana should be
                    anxious and ready to help in rehabilitating and making over the world at the close of the present
                         conflict. Also it is believed to be the part of wisdom to
                    recommend that, in the future, Indiana should be less prone to pull back and more anxious to support
                    the efforts and plans of leaders who wish to make America a better place in which to
                    live—a country where the welfare and the rights of the humblest citizen will be made as
                    secure as possible; where economic as well as political democracy shall prevail. Is it too much to
                    hope that the Hoosier commonwealth may become an outstanding and daring experimenter among the
                    states of the nation in the new day that is coming, not a blind champion of a return to
                    normalcy—a return that is impossible in any event.
            The abundance and excellence of Indiana's resources have already been stressed. The high
                    average of well-being is something that would naturally be expected. It is something of which the
                    state has a right to, be proud. The absence of extremes is noteworthy in regard to climate, economic
                    conditions, politics, and racial elements. This does not mean that the cities of Indiana do not have
                    their poor districts, but it does mean that poverty is not so intensive nor the areas where it
                    prevails so extensive as in some sister states. The absence of striking contrasts tends to enhance
                    the conservatism of Hoosiers, though it does not necessarily make them into reactionaries of the
                    Bourbon type. Progressive leaders can win victories in Indiana, but they cannot, as a rule, hold out
                    very long against the powerful currents that are directed against them. In this contention, it is a
                    sad commentary on the rank and file of the citizens of Indiana that they can so complacently permit
                    conservative interests to drive liberals from positions of leadership.
            The resources of Indiana are still very great. The state is not dominated by a large city. There is
                    still a fairly even balance between agriculture and industry and likewise between Republicans and
                    Democrats. Hoosiers are today about as fit physically and mentally as any. There is a mellowness
                    about life in Hoosierland that inspires literary talent to express itself. A considerable part of
                    the population can find time for reflection. These are conditions that should bring results, and it
                    is possible to indulge the hope that they may become the foundation for greater social and economic
                    progress, for a higher culture and a nobler vision, and for leadership of a higher arid more daring
                    quality.
         
         
         
            The Boundary and Jurisdictional Problems of the Ohio River
            
            EUGENE O. PORTER
            The Ohio River forms parts of the boundaries of five states and in so doing
                    advances two problems: first, that of the actual boundary of each state on the river; and second,
                    that of the jurisdiction which each state may exercise on the river. 
                        Virginia
                    , in her deed of cession of the Old Northwest and in her enabling act for 
                        Kentucky
                    , chose, at the time, to divide her jurisdiction over the river between herself and 
                        Kentucky
                    , on the one hand, and the proposed states north of the river, on the other hand; but
                    she did not choose to divide the dominion over the soil of the river bed. With the exception of
                    Indiana, however, the states involved have failed or refused to understand the twofold aspect of the
                    problem.
            It is not the purpose of this study to examine the several charters of 
                        Virginia
                     in order to determine the validity of 
                        Virginia
                    's claims to the Old Northwest.1 It is enough to state that 
                        Virginia
                     held uncontested claims to the territory west of 
                        Pennsylvania
                     and north of the Ohio River to the forty-first parallel.2 But in her deed of cession to the government of the Confederation in 1784, 
                        Virginia
                     ceded 
                        all right, title, and claim, as well of soil as jurisdiction, which this commonwealth hath to
                            the territory…within the limits of the

                    brought about by an act of the 
                        Kentucky

                    projection was completely surrounded by water and therefore had the appearance of an island. The
                    federal government had granted patents for this land. Then 
                        Kentucky
                     developed the theory that her boundary extended to the opposite shore at high-water
                    mark and likewise granted patents for the projecting land. Finally, in 1820, the conflicting claims
                    were carried before the Supreme Court of the 
                        United States
                     in the case of Handly's Lessee v. Anthony et
                        al.
               4
            
            Chief Justice John Marshall wrote the decision in this case. He denied 
                        Kentucky
                    's claims in no uncertain terms, saying that 
                        When a great river is the boundary between two nations or states, if the original property is
                            in neither, and there be no convention respecting it, each holds to the middle of the
                            stream. But when, as in this case, one State is the original proprietor, and grants the
                            territory on one side only. it retains the river within its own domain, and the
                            newly-created State extends to the river only. The river, however, is its boundary.
                     But, continued the Chief Justice: 
                        Whenever the river is a boundary between states, it is the main, permanent river, which
                            constitutes that boundary; and the mind will find itself embarrassed with insurmountable
                            difficulty in attempting to draw any other line than the low water mark.
                     Furthermore, the Chief Justice distinguished between a river and its shores. "The
                    shores of a river," he wrote, "border on the water's edge."
            Likewise, in 1898, the Supreme Court of the 
                        United States
                     restated the Marshall decision in the case of the 
                        Henderson
                     Bridge Company v.
                    
                        Henderson
                     City.5 In this particular case the court upheld the right of 
                        Henderson
                     City, 
                        Kentucky
                    , to tax the company's bridge from the 
                        Kentucky
                     side over the Ohio River to low-water mark on the Indiana side, on
                    the ground that 
                        Kentucky
                     owned the river to the north shore at low-water mark.
            Thus one would think that these decisions of the supreme tribunal had settled the boundary question.
                    But they had not. Indeed, 
                        Virginia
                     asserted before and after the above decisions that her boundary extended to the
                    northwest shore

                     at high-water mark; and 
                        Illinois
                     asserted that her boundary extended to the middle of the stream. 
                        Virginia
                     leased as public some land lying between high- and low-water mark on the 
                        Ohio
                     side, but the 
                        Ohio
                     proprietor whose land bounded on the river at that point brought a suit of ejectment.
                    The suit was carried to the Supreme Court of 
                        Ohio
                     in 1841, and the court declared that such land was not common to the public as part of
                    the river but that it belonged to the adjacent proprietor. Furthermore, the court pointed to
                    Marshall's decision of 1820 and stated that the boundary line between 
                        Ohio
                     and 
                        Virginia
                     was the Ohio River at low-water mark on the 
                        Ohio
                     side.6
            
            At the same time, 
                        Illinois
                     maintained that "at common law, [if the] lands [are] bounded by a stream not
                    navigable, the rights of the riparian owner extend to the middle thread of the current."7 This doctrine was first promulgated in 1842; it was repeated in 1868 in the
                    case of Ensminger v. the People of the State of 
                        Illinois
                    ,8 and in 1888 in the case of John Fuller v. J.
                    Victor Dauphin.9 It is true, of course, that these cases pertained to the
                        Mississippi River and that no such case pertaining to the Ohio
                        River has ever been reviewed by the Supreme Court of 
                        Illinois
                    . Yet the court has gone on record to the effect that the 
                        Mississippi
                     is not a navigable stream at common law, a navigable stream at common law being one in
                    which the tide ebbs and flows.10 Certainly, with this interpretation, the
                        Ohio River is also a non-navigable stream; therefore the court would hardly
                    reverse itself in a case pertaining to the Ohio River.
            It is the problem of jurisdiction, however, which has been least understood by the several states.
                    And to understand this problem it is necessary to return to

                        Kentucky
                     into an Independent State," commonly called the "Compact with 
                        Virginia
                    ." In Section XI of that compact, 
                        Virginia
                     stated that the "respective jurisdictions of this Commonwealth, and of the

                                v. Meyler (see post, footnote 44) pointed out that 
                                Illinois
                             tended to claim to the middle of the stream.
               
                     shall be concurrent only with the States which may possess the
                    opposite shores of the said river." At the same time, 
                        Virginia
                     decreed that the use and navigation of the Ohio River should be
                    "free and common to the citizens of the 
                        United States
                    ."11
                    
                        Kentucky
                    , of course, accepted this compact and incorporated Section XI in her several
                        constitutions.12
            
            Nevertheless, from the first settlement of the Northwest Territory, 
                        Kentucky
                     claimed exclusive jurisdiction over the Ohio River where it
                    touches her soil. As a result, difficulties and embarrassments arose. Persons arrested by
                    territorial officers for crimes committed on boats lying or floating near the shore of the Territory
                    were discharged on pleas that the territorial courts lacked jurisdiction. "This condition
                    of things…frequently resulted in the escape of criminals, from deserved
                        punishment."13 Finally, in 1799, the territorial legislature
                    decided to counteract the claims of 
                        Kentucky
                    ; but, in so doing, she based her legislation not on the compact, but on the fact that
                    the river had been declared a public highway.14 In an act defining and
                    regulating privileges, the territorial legislature inserted a clause which stated that "all
                    arrests…made in any place, or on any river or water course, within or bounding the
                    territory, shall be deemed lawful."15 This act was passed by a
                    unanimous vote in each house and approved by the governor, with the distinct understanding that it
                    asserted the right of concurrent jurisdiction over the whole river.16 But
                    evidently the territorial law was not enforced, for later, in 1813, the 
                        Ohio
                     legislature passed a resolution requesting the governor to correspond with the governor
                    of 
                        Kentucky
                     concerning the appointment of commissioners to meet with commissioners from

                     and objects of their several concurring jurisdictions on the
                    said river."17 But the governor of 
                        Kentucky
                     refused to discuss the matter.
            The attitude of 
                        Kentucky
                     is an unusual one. She has, of course, constantly recognized her right of jurisdiction
                    over. the Ohio River, and she has recognized the fact that Indiana has
                    concurrent jurisdiction with her over the river. At the same time, she has refused to admit that 
                        Ohio
                     has any jurisdiction at all over the river where it touches her shore.
            But, even so, 
                        Kentucky
                     has confused the problem of the boundary with that of jurisdiction, inasmuch as her
                    supreme court has cited the Marshall decision in order to claim jurisdiction. The first such
                    decision was handed down in 1835 in a case in chancery, Church et al. v. Chambers.
                    In this case the constitutionality of two 
                        Kentucky
                     statutes, one of 1824 and another of 1828, was questioned. The former. made liable to
                    damages the master of any vessel who suffered a slave to come aboard for the purpese of crossing the
                    river. The latter statute extended the liabilities to the "owners, mate, clerk, pilot, and
                    engineer." In the case in question, suit for damages was brought against some of the owners
                    and officers of the steamboat "Magnolia," because three slaves had been taken
                    aboard and carried without the owner's consent from 
                        Kentucky
                     to 
                        Cincinnati
                    . Here the slaves had disappeared and, it was presumed, had gone to 
                        Canada
                    .
            The plea of the defense attorney in this case was that "the slaves were not taken from 
                        Kentucky
                    , not being…in this state when they were taken on board; and, if they were
                    then in this state, not being out of it when they disembarked." But the 
                        Kentucky
                     Supreme Court cited the Marshall decision and stated that 
                        Kentucky
                     laws "operate on all persons, on so much of the Ohio
                    river as is within the jurisdictional limits of 
                        Kentucky
                    " and that "that is the whole of it from shore to shore lying on her
                        border."18 Likewise, in 1846 in a similar case, McFarland v. McKnight, the Supreme Court of 
                        Kentucky
                     again recognized the constitutionality of the above-mentioned statutes and based its
                    decision upon that of Marshall. In this case, however, the court was more expansive. It stated that
                    "the whole power, legislative, executive, 
                  
                     17
                            Laws of 
                                    Ohio
                                
                     , XI, 172.

                     and judicial, belongs to the State of 
                        Kentucky
                    , over the waters of the Ohio river to the northwestern shore or
                        bank."19
            
            At the same time, 
                        Kentucky
                     has recognized the fact that Indiana has concurrent jurisdiction with her on the
                        Ohio River. This recognition was first made in 1837 in the case of Arnold
                    and Parish v. Shields et al.
               20 In this case
                    the Supreme Court of 
                        Kentucky
                     stated: 
                        Jurisdiction, unqualified, being, as it is, the sovereign authority to make, decide on, and
                            execute laws, a concurrence of jurisdiction, therefore, must entitle Indiana to as much
                            power—legislative, judiciary, and executive, as that possessed by 
                                Kentucky
                            , over so much of the Ohio river as flows between them; and
                            consequently, neither of them can, consistently with the compact, exercise any authority
                            over their common river, so as to destroy or impair, or obstruct the concurrent rights of
                            the other.
                    
            
            Possibly the reason 
                        Kentucky
                     admitted that Indiana had concurrent jurisdiction with her on the Ohio
                    River was due to the strong claims made by the latter state. In fact, Indiana placed in
                    her constitution of 1851 the following clause: "The State of Indiana…shall have
                    concurrent jurisdiction in civil and criminal cases, with the State of 
                        Kentucky
                     on the Ohio River."21 Likewise, an
                    Indiana statute states that "Whenever any part of the boundary of any county is the
                        Ohio river, all process issuing to the officers of such county may be
                    served on the said river, so far as the same is the boundary of this State."22
            
            Nor is this all. In the several cases which have come before the Supreme Court of Indiana, the claim
                    of concurrent jurisdiction has been upheld. For instance, in 1869 in the case of 
                        Carlisle
                     and Another v. The State,23 the supreme court
                    upheld the conviction of 
                        Carlisle
                    , charged with the offense of having committed a murder on a boat in the Ohio
                        River opposite 
                        Spencer County
                    , Indiana, beyond low-water mark. Likewise, in the case of Dugan v.
                    The State,24 in the case of Welsh v. The State,25 and in the case of The 
                        Memphis

                     Packet Company v. Pikey, Administratrix,26 the
                    supreme court upheld the state's claim of concurrent jurisdiction with 
                        Kentucky
                     on the Ohio River where it touches her border.
            But it was in the case of Sherlock et al. v. Alling, Administrator, in 1873, that
                    the Indiana court distinguished between boundary and jurisdiction. In this case a man named
                    Sappington had been a passenger on the steamboat "
                        United States
                    ," which collided with the "American" in mid-channel near the 
                        Kentucky
                     shore. The collision caused the death of Sappington; and Alling, the administrator of
                    the estate of of the deceased, brought suit for damages on the ground of negligence. The defense
                    maintained that the Indiana court lacked jurisdiction, inasmuch as the negligence had occurred near
                    the 
                        Kentucky
                     shore. But the court took a common-sense point of view when it stated: 
                        Our conclusion is that the State of Indiana possesses concurrent jurisdiction with the State
                            of 
                                Kentucky
                             on the Ohio river, where the two states possess the
                            opposite shores, although for the purpose of determining the boundaries, low-water mark on
                            the north-west side of the river is the true line.27
                  
                    
            
            How realistic the attitude of Indiana has been can be understood only when compared with that of 
                        Ohio
                    . The latter state has denied itself any kind of jurisdiction on the Ohio
                        River, because it confused Marshall's low-water mark interpretation of the
                    boundary with the question of jurisdiction. For example, in 1858, a suit somewhat similar to the
                    Sherlock-Alling case mentioned above came before the 
                        Ohio
                     State Supreme Court. James G. Hubbard had been a passenger on an Ohio
                    River steamboat and had been accidentally pushed into the river and drowned when the boat
                    was landing at Bellaire, 
                        Ohio
                    . Benjamin Shepherd, as administrator of the Hubbard estate, brought suit against the
                    owners of the boat on the ground of negligence. But the court, while admitting the defendants guilty
                    of negligence, denied judgment on the ground that 
                        Ohio
                     courts lacked jurisdiction, inasmuch as the negligence had occurred beyond the
                    low-water mark.28

            This attitude on the part of 
                        Ohio
                     may have been due partly to the refusal of 
                        Virginia
                     to recognize the Marshall decision. As a matter of fact, 
                        Virginia
                    , and later West 
                        Virginia
                    , maintained that her actual boundary extended to ordinary high-water mark on the 
                        Ohio
                     side and, consequently, that her jurisdiction extended to the boundary line. However,
                    the Supreme Court of 
                        Virginia
                     in 1845 disagreed in its interpretation of the actual boundary. The case in question
                    was The Commonwealth v. Peter M. Garner et al,29 Garner had
                    been captured by 
                        Virginia
                     police officers on the 
                        Ohio
                     shore, while encouraging slaves to escape from the Harwood plantation near Parkersburg, 
                        Virginia
                    . Fourteen justices sat on the 
                        Virginia
                     bench and, although the majority of them accepted the pronouncement of Marshall, the
                    court was unable to reach a decision. The defendants were dismissed upon their recognizance, and no
                    subsequent trial was ever held.30
            
            One result of this case, however, was the appointment of commissioners by 
                        Ohio
                     and 
                        Virginia
                     for the purpose of "settling the jurisdiction, or boundary, or both, upon that
                    part of the Ohio river which divides the States of 
                        Ohio
                     and 
                        Virginia
                    ." The 
                        Ohio
                     commission, composed of Thomas Ewing, John Brough, and James Collier, met the 
                        Virginia
                     commission, composed of William C. Rives, William Green, and George W. Thompson, in 
                        Washington
                     on January 10, 1848.
            The 
                        Ohio
                     commissioners prepared themselves for the meeting and submitted the five following
                    propositions: 
                        
                     1. That the middle thread of the Ohio river, where there is no
                                island therein, shall be the boundary between the said States; and where there is an
                                island or islands in said river, the middle of the channel on the 
                                    Ohio
                                 side of such island or islands, shall be the boundary.
                     2. That each State shall have exclusive jurisdiction over all her shore without the
                                banks of said river at all times, and within the banks when the same shall not be
                                covered with the waters of said river.
                     3. That each State on its own shore, or the citizens thereof, may extend into the
                                river—but not so far, or in such manner, as to obstruct the navigation
                                thereof—wharves, abutments, locks, slopes, warehouses, mills and other
                                fixtures…and may project into the river pipes, pumps, and other machinery for
                                drawing water therefrom, all of which shall be within the exclusive jurisdiction of the
                                State owning the shore; as also shall all boats, vessels, rafts, and other water craft
                                of every kind attached to, or moored by the shore for the purpose of holding

                     4. That with the above exceptions, the two States shall have concurrent jurisdiction
                                over and upon the said river within its banks.
                     5. And the said river within its banks, so far as it flows between the said States,
                                shall be taken and deemed to be a navigable water to all intents and purposes as if the
                                tide ebbed and flowed therein.
                  
                    
            
            The 
                        Virginia
                     commissioners, however, refused to accept in toto the propositions
                    submitted by the Ohioans. The Virginians demanded that 
                        The dominion and jurisdiction of the State of 
                                Virginia
                             retained under her deed of cession aforesaid, henceforth to be deemed and taken
                            to extend, under all circumstances, to the actual edge, for the time being, of the water
                            within the banks of the Ohio river, on the northwestern side of the
                            said river; and the same shall be in no matter diminished, impaired, impeded, or any
                            otherwise affected by any claims which the State of 
                                Ohio
                             may have, by virtue of this compact or otherwise, to the soil which shall at
                            any time be beneath the water in the said river.31
                  
                    
            
            Thus 
                        Virginia
                     claimed that her jurisdiction extended to the high-water mark, or to the top of the
                    bank on the northwestern side of the river. But 
                        Ohio
                     refused to accept the demands of 
                        Virginia
                    ; therefore no agreement was reached between the commissioners.
            The next effort on the part of 
                        Ohio
                     to bring about a solution of the jurisdictional question was in 1877. In that year the
                    Fish Commission of 
                        Ohio
                    , in its report concerning fish culture in the state, considered also the subject of the
                    territory over which 
                        Ohio
                     laws could be enforced. This involved the question of jurisdiction on the
                        Ohio River. The commission suggested that the legislatures of the three
                    states, 
                        Ohio
                    , West 
                        Virginia
                    , and 
                        Kentucky
                    , appoint commissioners to fix the boundary line along the middle of the navigable
                    channel of the Ohio River.32
            
            Likewise, in his annual message to the 
                        Ohio
                     legislature in January, 1878, Governor Young recommended the appointment of boundary
                    commissioners to meet with such commissioners as might be appointed by West 
                        Virginia
                     and 
                        Kentucky
                    . The governor, in making this suggestion, stated that 
                        Parties resident of West 
                                Virginia
                             and of 
                                Kentucky
                             habitually place seines across the mouths or outlets of 
                                Ohio
                             streams near the 
                                Ohio
                             side, in the season of the year when migratory fish are seeking the mouths of
                            streams flowing into the Ohio river, thus preventing migratory fishes
                            from ascending and depositing their spawn to restock said streams with food fishes.

                     Continuing, the governor said: 
                        It is not charged that the residents of these States have, by their conduct, violated any
                            law, for it is claimed for them, and the claim has been admitted as valid by the Supreme
                            Court of 
                                Ohio
                            
                     33 in the case of Booth vs. Hubbard, 8 O. S. R., 243, that
                            the boundary line of the State of 
                                Ohio
                            , dividing us from these States, is low-water mark on the 
                                Ohio
                             side.34
                  
                     The only result of the governor's recommendation, however, was a joint resolution
                    of the general assembly to print in pamphlet form the report of the fish commission.35
            
            The reason, of course, that West 
                        Virginia
                     has refused to arbitrate the boundary and jurisdictional questions is that she has
                    adopted the "top of the bank" interpretation. This interpretation was first
                    advanced by the supreme court of that state in 1883 in the case of Ravenswood v.
                        Flemings.36 In this case the court declared that riparian owners
                    "hold…titles…to ordinary high water mark" on the 
                        Ohio
                     side of the river. And the following year the court, in the case of The State v.
                    Plants, rendered a similar decision. Plants had been arrested by West 
                        Virginia
                     officers for selling liquor from a boat which was tied to the top of the bank on the 
                        Ohio
                     side. At the time of the arrest the river was at high stage. The court in its decision
                    declared "the jurisdiction of West 
                        Virginia
                     to be co-extensive with the water of the' Ohio river
                    while confined within its banks." To prove its point the court defined a river: 
                        The most approved of these writers (on the laws of nations) define a river to consist of the
                            water, the bed and the banks. It is a compound idea; it cannot exist in the absence of any
                            of its constituent parts. Deprive it of a bank, and it loses its character of a river.37
                  
                    
            
            These decisions, moreover, are in harmony with West 
                        Virginia
                    's constitution of 1872, which states that West 
                        Virginia
                    's jurisdiction includes "the bed, bank and shores of the
                        Ohio river."38 Likewise, they are in harmony
                    with the West 
                            Virginia
                         Code of 1937, which states that "The jurisdiction of West 
                        Virginia
                     is co-extensive with the water of the Ohio river while confined
                    within its banks."39

            Returning now to 
                        Kentucky
                    , it will be seen that the supreme court of that state has refused to recognize 
                        Ohio
                    's right to concurrent jurisdiction on the Ohio River. It
                    was in 1859 that the 
                        Kentucky
                     court handed down a decision to the above effect, when an 
                        Ohio
                     justice of the peace carried up on appeal a case wherein he had been convicted for
                    unlawfully solemnizing a marriage. The marriage ceremony was performed on a ferry boat on the
                        Ohio River, midway between 
                        Newport
                     and 
                        Cincinnati
                    . Under the laws of 
                        Ohio
                     the justice was authorized to solemnize marriages. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court of 
                        Kentucky
                     upheld the verdict of the lower court on the ground that 
                        Kentucky
                     had exclusive jurisdiction over the Ohio River. In so doing,
                    however, the court commented mistakenly that "It did not appear that 
                        Ohio
                     had ever, by its legislation, assumed, or claimed, or asserted jurisdiction, exclusive
                    or concurrent [on the Ohio River]." Continuing, the court stated that
                        
                        It is a part of the legislative history of the country that negotiations having in view the
                            settlement of those questions, have been several times attempted. And it may not be out of
                            place here to express the hope that the whole subject may be finally disposed of in such
                            manner as to secure the concurrent rights of…the several States interested in its
                                adjustment.40
                  
                    
            
            
               
                        Illinois
                    , on the other hand, has provided by statute for concurrent jurisdiction on the
                        Ohio River where it touches her soil. One statute reads: "Each
                    county bounded by either the 
                        Mississippi
                    , 
                        Ohio
                    , or Wabash river, shall have jurisdiction over such river to the
                    extent it is so bounded, which jurisdiction may be exercised concurrently with the contiguous states
                    bounded by such river."41 And another statute grants concurrent
                    jurisdiction to the "several cities and incorporated towns…lying on the
                        Ohio river."42
            
            Of course, the most important thing to consider in this question of jurisdiction is the attitude of
                    the Supreme Court of the 
                        United States
                    . And here we are fortunate, inasmuch as this court has clarified the problem. As a
                    matter of fact, as early as 1823, in the case of Green et al. v. Biddle,42 the Supreme Court held that the compact of 1789 between 
                        Virginia
                     and 
                        Kentucky
                     was valid under the provisions of the Constitution and that Congress consented to the
                    admission 
                  
                     40 McFall v. Commonwealth, 2 Metcalfe, 394.
                  
                     41
                            
                        
                                    Illinois
                                 Statutes (1937), Ch. 34, Sec. 2.
                  
                     42
                            Ibid., Ch. 24, Sec. 418.

                     of 
                        Kentucky
                     into the Union upon the condition mentioned in the compact. Thus it would seem that the
                    question of concurrent jurisdiction on the Ohio River had been settled; but
                    another such decision was necessary.
            This decision was made in 1904 in the case of Wedding v. Meyler.44 This case had been carried up on error from the 
                        Warren
                     Circuit Court of the state of 
                        Kentucky
                    . The question denied jurisdiction to an Indiana court in the matter of the service of a
                    suit on a steamboat in the Ohio River on the Indiana side. The opinion of the
                    Supreme Court, which was read by Justice Holmes, upheld Indiana's concurrent jurisdiction
                    with 
                        Kentucky
                    . He asserted: 
                        What the 
                                Virginia
                             Compact most certainly conferred on the States north of the 
                                Ohio
                            , was the right to administer the law below low-water mark on the river, and, as
                            part of that right, the right to serve process there with effect. What more jurisdiction, as
                            used in the statute, may embrace, or what law or laws properly would determine the civil or
                            criminal effect of acts done upon the river we have no occasion to decide in this case. But
                            SO far as applicable we adopt the statement of Chief Justice Robertson in Arnold vs.
                            Shields….
                        To avoid misunderstanding it may be well to add that the concurrent jurisdiction given is
                            jurisdiction "on" the river, and does not extend to permanent structures
                            attached to the river bed and within the boundary of one or the other State.44
                  
                    
            
            And so rests the problem of the Ohio River. But, as we have seen, only Indiana
                    has accepted a rational and legal point of view concerning it—that the boundary of the
                    states formed of the Old Northwest extends only to low-water mark on the northern shore, but that
                    these states have concurrent jurisdiction on the entire river, where it touches their shores, with
                    West Virgina and 
                        Kentucky
                    . On the other hand, the remaining four states which are touched by the Ohio
                        River each have a different point of view. West 
                        Virginia
                     maintains that her boundary reaches to the top of the bank on the 
                        Ohio
                     side and that she has exclusive jurisdiction over the same area. 
                        Ohio
                     accepts the low-water mark as a boundary line but she limits her jurisdiction to the
                    same line. 
                        Kentucky
                     also accepts the low-water boundary line and she admits that Indiana has concurrent
                    jurisdiction over the river with her. At the same time, she refuses to admit that 
                        Ohio
                     has such jurisdiction. And 
                        Illinois
                    , while claiming concurrent jurisdiction with 
                        Kentucky
                    , tends to reject the low-water mark boundary and looks toward the middle of the stream.

            The 
                        Lincoln
                     Collector
            PAUL M. ANGLE
            In the foreword to his 
                  
                            Lincoln
                         Bibliography, Judge Oak-leaf described the genesis of his 
                        Lincoln
                     collection. Like thousands of others, he became deeply interested in the story of 
                        Lincoln
                    's life as the Civil War President's secretaries, Nicolay and Hay,
                    related it month by month in the Century Magazine fifty odd years ago. Mr. Oakleaf
                    was then a young lawyer in Moline, 
                        Illinois
                    , and, one may safely assume, not overburdened with money. Nevertheless, he resolved to
                    make a collection of biographies of 
                        Lincoln
                    . Some years later he was influenced by a copy of Daniel Fish's Bibliography, and by the encouragement of Fish himself, to enlarge his fields from
                    biographies alone to all 
                        Lincoln
                     literature. His resolution was strengthened soon afterward when he got in touch with
                    Fish's friendly rivals in the collecting of Lincolniana—Stewart, Lambert,
                    McLellan, and Burton.
            I take it that Oakleaf was unaware, in 1890, that he was following a tradition already well
                    established. Not until years afterwards did he learn that the collecting of 
                        Lincoln
                     books and pamphlets had begun even before 
                        Lincoln
                    's death; that as early as 1865 William V. Spencer had published a list
                    containing 231 titles of his own ownership. Five years afterward Andrew Boyd listed the titles of
                    500 books, pamphlets, broadsides, and emphemeral publications in his collection, while Charles Henry
                    Hart itemized nearly that number of sermons and eulogies which he had assembled. By this
                    time—1870—William H. Lambert of 
                        Philadelphia
                     was actively collecting; so was Charles W. McLellan of Champlain, 
                        New York
                    ; and John E. Burton, of Lake 
                        Geneva
                    , 
                        Wisconsin
                    , was soon to begin. The other members of the Big Five, or Big Six, as they finally came
                    to be known—Judd Stewart and Daniel Fish—were also predecessors of Oakleaf in
                    the 
                        Lincoln
                     field.
            It is probable too, that Judge Oakleaf was unaware, at least in the beginning, that he was following
                    a tradition antedating by centuries the collecting of Lincolniana. Almost from the beginning of
                    printing men have acquired books, and the genus collector—the bibliomaniac, as some would
                    have it—was a well established character in 
                        England
                     and Europe as early as the middle of the seventeenth century. But not  there only. We, as Americans, can take pride in the fact that men of
                    the breed made their appearance on our own shores almost at the beginning of colonial times. As far
                    as 1 know, there were no book collectors among the one hundred men and boys who disembarked at 
                        Jamestown
                     in 1607, but the Mayflower carried not only the first families of the
                    New World, not only much of the furniture that stocks New 
                        England
                    's antique shops, but also our first bibliophile. He was William
                    Brewster—Elder Brewster of the 
                        Plymouth
                     church—who bought books throughout his life, and died possessed of almost
                    400 volumes. Nor was he alone. Of similar tastes, but with less chance to indulge them, was none
                    other than the bluff but timorous Miles Standish, whose estate included fifty books.
            These, of course, were only precursors, soon to be eclipsed by those who followed in their footsteps.
                    Foremost among the latter were the Mathers. Richard Mather began to collect books in 
                        England
                     as early as 1610; in the 
                        Massachusetts
                     Bay Colony he kept up the practice. His son and grandson, Increase and Cotton Mathers,
                    added to the collection until in the latter's time it numbered 4000 volumes and "a
                    prodigious number of manuscripts." Second only to the Mathers in book collecting was Samuel
                    Sewall, better known as a diarist and as a member of the court which tried the 
                        Salem
                     witches. In 
                        Virginia
                    , William Byrd of Westover—planter, author, and colonial
                    official—was gathering what was, for its time, the greatest library in the South. Among
                    his 3600 volumes were to be found the works of all important English writers from Chaucer to his own
                    day as well as the writings of such continental Europeans as Boccaccio and Rabelais. (One suspects
                    that his was a far more interesting collection than those of his strait-laced contemporaries in 
                        Massachusetts
                    .) Byrd, moreover, set a precedent: several times in his life he had to sell land and
                    negroes to pacify his creditors. (It is not recorded that he ever parted with any of his books.)
            To call the roll of American book collectors would be pleasant and perhaps instructive, but it would
                    certainly require more time than even a greedy speaker should take on an occasion like this. Suffice
                    to say that the roll includes many a famous name—Benjamin Franklin at the end of the 18th
                    century; John Adams and Thomas Jefferson in the early years of the Republic; John Carter 
                        Brown
                    , James Lenox,  J. Pierpont Morgan, and Henry E.
                    Huntington in the 19th and 20th centuries. Those names are hardly a beginning, but they are
                    sufficient in number to establish both the character and continuity of the fraternity of collectors
                    with which Judge Oakleaf allied himself when he bought his first biography of 
                        Lincoln
                     half a century ago.
            In still another sense, it was a great tradition which he was following. Note, if you will, a few
                    bare facts. The Bodleian Library, one of 
                        England
                    's great university libraries, was founded—or, more properly,
                    refounded—by Sir Thomas Bodley's gift of books and manuscripts. The beloved
                    books of Samuel Pepys, diarist without a peer, went to Magdalen College at 
                        Cambridge
                    . Sir Hans Sloane's gift of 50,000 books led to the establishment of the
                    British Museum in 1753, and the institution was greatly enriched later by the royal libraries
                    donated by George II, and to his eternal credit, George III. (The latter's gift was 80,000
                    books and pamphlets, and 440 manuscripts.) In America 
                        Harvard
                     University took its name from the young clergyman who bequeathed to it his library of
                    three or four hundred books. It was the private library of Thomas Jefferson, purchased by the
                    nation, which became the nucleus of the Library of Congress after that infant institution was
                    destroyed in the War of 1812. Before Jefferson, and after him, the acquisitions of collectors have
                    gone to institutions, either by gift or purchase, with such frequency that a leading authority,
                    William Dana Orcutt, has offered this considered judgment: 
                        "It is mainly by the zeal of private collectors that books which otherwise would
                            have perished from neglect are discovered, preserved and made to yield up their secrets,
                            with the result that almost every great library owes more, on its historical side, to their
                            generosity than to the purchases made from its own resources."
                    
            
            Whether this be true in general or not, it is certainly true of 
                        Lincoln
                     collections. Take the collections of those men whom I described as the friendly rivals
                    of Judge Oak-leaf. The Judd Stewart collection is now the possession of the 
                        Huntington
                     Library. That of McLellan is the property of the 
                        Brown
                     University Library. Daniel Fish's books are owned by the 
                        Lincoln
                     National Life Foundation. The collections of Burton and Lambert were dispersed at
                    auction, but it is safe to assume that nearly all of them are now parts of public collections or
                    destined for that end. For  the process continues. In the last
                    few years the very fine collection of Henry Horner has gone to the 
                        Illinois
                     State Historical Library, that of David Nelson to the 
                        Lincoln
                     Memorial University, that of Valentine Bjorkman to Upsala College, that of A. H.
                    Greenly to the William L. Clements Library, and that of Ida M. Tarbell to her alma mater, Allegheny
                    College. To my personal knowledge, moreover, several outstanding present-day collectors have made
                    arrangements to bequeath their collections to institutions of learning, and I have no doubt that
                    there are others who will come to the same decision, if they have not done so already.
            This bare recital emphasizes two points. One is that in Indiana University, a great institution of
                    learning, the Oak-leaf collection has found as appropriate a home as anyone could wish. The second
                    is the fact that so much of the collector's work is done for the ultimate benefit of
                    scholars that scholars owe men like J. B. Oakleaf a very heavy debt. That point is worth repeating
                    time and again, because I am far from sure that the scholar is aware of the obligation.
            Of course I am using words loosely. Admittedly, the collector can be, and often is, a scholar; and by
                    the same token the scholar can be, and sometimes is, a collector. But by and large, the two words
                    designate distinct, easily recognizable classes, the scholar being one who is interested solely in
                    the contents of a book or manuscript, while the collector is that strange person to whom the book or
                    manuscript has value apart from, or in addition to, what is in it.
            Now the scholar is just a little bit inclined to look down his nose at the collector. It is hard for
                    him to understand, for example, why the collector builds a fence around his field.
                    "What!" he says to the 
                        Lincoln
                     collector, "you don't include the Welles Diary or the Diary of
                    Orville H. Browning in your 
                        Lincoln
                     collection? But man, they're basic sources!" "To be
                    sure," replies the collector with just a touch of warmth because he has been all through
                    this times without end; "but those books aren't devoted in major
                    part to 
                        Lincoln
                    , and that's the line I draw." "But you would put in a
                    worthless little pamphlet like that Vose campaign biography of 
                        Lincoln
                    , and pay a stiff price for it too." "You bet I would,"
                    replies the collector with a gleam in his eye; "do you know where I can find one?"
                    The scholar gives up—there's no use talking to a fanatic.
            
            Of course, the example 1 have cited—and it is not an imaginary one—cannot be
                    justified on any logical ground. Some limitation, however, is a practical necessity, and the
                    boundary might just as well be sharp and straight as blurred and wavy. Besides, the point of
                    difference is of little real significance. Copies of the Welles Diary, the Diary of Orville H.
                    Browning, and the other standard works which the 
                        Lincoln
                     collector rules out are legion, but try to find the Vose biography! (Just two copies
                    are known to be in existence.) And who can be sure that any book or pamphlet on a live subject is
                    worthless? I used to think that the sermons preached on the occasion of 
                        Lincoln
                    's death were as nearly valueless as printed paper could be. So they are, from
                    the standpoint of the biographer interested in the facts of 
                        Lincoln
                    's life. Search them all and I don't suppose you will find a single
                    biographical fact that can't be found, in better authenticated form, in some far more
                    accessible source. But fourteen or fifteen years ago Lloyd Lewis wrote one of the most original
                    books in all 
                        Lincoln
                     literature, Myths After 
                            Lincoln
                        
               . And in that book three of the most interesting chapters are based on what?
                    The sermons preached on the occasion of 
                        Lincoln
                    's death!
            The scholar is often unable to understand, moreover, the collector's insistence upon
                    originals. "A photostat will do just as well," is one of his favorite remarks. And
                    when the collector carries his quest to the point of insisting not only upon the original, but upon
                    original condition as well, the scholar sometimes looks upon him with pity. "The poor
                    simpleton," he says to himself, "what does it matter if the front cover is gone?
                    The text is all there."
            To that argument the collector can make an effective reply. In the first place, it is obvious that if
                    one is to have photostats, there must first be originals, and it is also obvious that if everyone
                    were content with photostats, before long most of the originals would be sold for waste paper. In
                    the second place, there are times when a photostat won't do just as well. For example, the
                    question of the legitimacy or illegitimacy of Nancy Hanks 
                        Lincoln
                     hinges upon the interpretation of a famous document—specifically, upon
                    whether the letters wi, making the word "widoy" or, conceivably, widow, are to be
                    found in a given place. The finest reproduction is inconclusive, but examination of the document
                    itself reveals clearly that those letters do not, in fact, exist. In the  third place, the original book, pamphlet, or letter makes an
                    appeal—a contribution, if you will—all its own. That contribution is best
                    expressed in the words of one of the most distinguished teachers of our time—the late
                    George Herbert Palmer of 
                        Harvard
                    —who was both a scholar and collector.
            
                    It is easy to over-estimate the value of old books…, their shape is often unhandy,
                        their type and paper poor; they usually abound in typopgraphical errors, and they are not
                        supplied with such notes and introductions as enable a reader to stand where the printer
                        stood….But they have a sentimental value as having been used by contemporaries of the
                        author, perhaps by the author himself….In my feeling, the presence of the poet is
                        there, as it cannot be in later issues.
                
            "Bosh," some will say; "that's an emotional appeal, and the
                    farther apart we keep emotion and scholarship, the better off we'll be."
                    Perhaps—but I should like to point out that universities find room willingly enough for
                    quite a few subjects whose appeal is largely emotional—for lyric poetry, for music, for
                    the fine arts. You don't care for John Donne, or Shostakovich, or—shall be we
                    say Thomas Hart 
                        Benton
                    ? Strangely enough, there are people who don't like baseball, or band music, or
                    even buckwheat cakes and sausage. "Chacun à son
                    goût," which, translated freely, means live and let live. Allow the
                    collector his foibles, and he, and not a few others, will call you blessed.
            Not only that: respect his own rules of the game when his handiwork comes into your possession. He
                    put more than his money, more than his time and knowledge, into his collection. Don't glue
                    labels on his rare books, don't plaster them with ownership stamps or pockets,
                    don't perforate the pages, don't rebind them unless you have to, and
                    don't paste his paper-covered pamphlets into ordinary pamphlet binders. In a word, keep his
                    collection in its original condition. Something of his life is in his books. Don't destroy
                    it.
            I have said that it was most appropriate that the Oakleaf Collection should find its final home in
                    the Indiana University. I had in mind, as I pointed out, the established affinity between
                    collections of books and institutions of learning. But in this case there is a further reason for
                    the fittingness of this conjunction. Only with my own state was Abraham 
                        Lincoln
                     more intimately associated than with Indiana: where more properly should a great 
                        Lincoln
                     collection be located than in Indiana's state university? And what more
                    fitting than that that collection should have been the life work of a citizen of 
                        Illinois
                    ?
         
         
         
            The Oakleaf Collection
            C. K. BYRD
            Readers of the Magazine will be interested to know that on February 13, Indiana
                    University formally opened to the public the Indiana Oakleaf collection of Lincolniana. This
                    collection is now housed in the 
                        Lincoln
                     Room located in the rare book area of the main library building where it may be viewed
                    and used by both the public and the student.
            It will be remembered that the University acquired the Oakleaf Collection by purchase in December of
                    1941. This was made possible by contributions to the Indiana University Foundation by the Ball
                    Brothers Foundation of 
                        Muncie
                    , William G. Irwin of 
                        Columbus
                    , and Frank L. Jones of 
                        New York
                     City.
            The Oakleaf Collection was the last of the great privately owned 
                        Lincoln
                     collections to be placed in a public institution. Joseph B. Oakleaf, an attorney of
                    Moline, 
                        Illinois
                    , spent over forty years gathering the material. By the time of his death in 1930, his
                    collection numbered some 8000 items. An entire issue of the Magazine could be
                    taken up with a description of the Oakleaf Collection alone. Suffice to say that in printed and
                    pictorial material it embraces practically every aspect of the 
                        Lincoln
                     theme. Speeches, biographies, histories, memoirs, journals, and diaries as well as
                    contemporary photographs, steel engravings, and lithographs enable one to get an estimate of the man 
                        Lincoln
                     and the world in which he lived.
            Since the Oakleaf Collection came to the University, much new material has been added to the
                    collection through the generosity of friends. The Ball Brothers Foundation recently presented a rare
                    and striking oil portrait of 
                        Lincoln
                     painted by Jessie Atwood at 
                        Springfield
                     in 1860. More recently this Foundation purchased the Robert Coster collection of
                    Lincolniana which contains over fifty manuscripts by 
                        Lincoln
                    , members of his cabinet and Mary 
                        Lincoln
                    , three oil paintings, 800 carte-de-visite photographs of the 
                        Lincoln
                     period, and many lithographs and rare pamphlets.
            A dinner held on the evening of February 13, marked the opening of the Collection. Due to war-time
                    restrictions on travel, the dinner was limited to fifty invited guests. Present were 
                        Lincoln
                     scholars from neighboring regions: Paul  Angle,
                    Harry Pratt, James Monaghan, William H. Townsend, R. Gerald McMurtry and others. The governmental
                    officials of Indiana were represented by Governor Schricker, Lieuten-ant-Governor Dawson, and others
                    from both the House and Senate. The University was represented by administrative officials and
                    members of the history department. Rounding out the list of guests were George A. Ball and A. M.
                    Bracken representing the Ball Brothers Foundation, William G. Irwin, and Frank L. Jones.
            The program on that occasion proved to be very appropriate and interesting. J. L. Oakleaf, son of
                    Joseph B. Oakleaf, spoke on the collecting activities of his father. Paul M. Angle, editor of the
                    Abraham 
                        Lincoln
                     Quarterly, spoke on "The 
                        Lincoln
                     Collector."1 A.L. Kohlmeier talked on "The
                    Hoosier 
                        Lincoln
                    ," and Governor Schricker gave an inspired address on "The State of
                    Indiana and Abraham 
                        Lincoln
                    ." For the final part of the program President Herman B Wells introduced the
                    honored guests Messrs. Ball, Bracken, Irwin and Jones.

            William Henry Smith Memorial Library of the Indiana Historical Society
            CAROLINE DUNN
            The library of the Indiana Historical Society has added to its collection during the past half year a
                    number of interesting items. Among them are the following.
            Four letters of August and September, 1812, tell of affairs at Fort Harrison, then at rather a crisis
                    with danger of an Indian attack imminent. Two are letters of Zachary Taylor, the others of John
                    Gibson, acting governor, to William Henry Harrison, and of Lt. Thomas H. Richardson, commanding at
                    Fort 
                        Knox
                    .
            To the library's already extensive collection of William Henry Harrison papers have been
                    added seven letters of 1812–14 and a DS of 1798. A colored lithograph of Harrison is an
                    addition to the very full collection of pictures of Harrison gathered by Mi.. A. G. Mitten and
                    acquired by the society after his death.
            A letter of St. Jean de Crevecoeur to the Duc de la Rochefoucauld, June 7, 1788, tells of earthworks
                    in 
                        Kentucky
                     and in 
                        Tennessee
                    , mentions how trader:; in these regions are supplied with merchandise from the British
                    in 
                        Detroit
                    , gives in some detail, with distances, rivers, and towns stated, the route from 
                        Detroit
                     to 
                        Nashville
                     by way of the Maumee and Wabash rivers, and
                    concludes with a comment on the critical point at which, he felt, the government of the 
                        United States
                     found itself at that time.
            General William North, in a four-page letter from Mus-kingum, August 7, 1786, tells of conditions
                    along the 
                        Ohio
                     and expresses his opinion of George Rogers Clark's backwoodsmen and their
                    ferocity toward the Indians.
            An act of The legislature of Indiana Territory of the session of 1811 is the fourteenth of the acts
                    of this session which has wandered into the library's possession. A curious thing about
                    them is that they differ in size, shape and handwriting.
            A group of Methodist material includes six letters of as many Indiana ministers, 1825–43,
                    telling of their work, listing books desired, and giving several items concerning another minister
                    (1824) and the constitution of the 
                        Madison
                     Sunday School Auxiliary (1828).
            
            I. Daniel Rupp's Geographical catechism of 
                            Pennsylvania
                         and the western states (1836) has some rather interesting comments on Indiana
                    and several of its towns. Lawrence-burgh floods are "conducive to health" because
                    they wash off accumulated dirt; 
                        Vevay
                    , with prosperous vineyards, culture and French vivacity combined with 
                        German
                     industry, sounds a heaven on earth; New 
                        Albany
                     "makes a respectable appearance"; 
                        Vincennes
                     "furnishes a pleasant and respectable society"; but 
                        Brookville
                     "is a decaying village"!
            Maps added to the library's collection include four of the early and middle 18th century
                    showing this part of North America, two of Indiana in the 1820's and a delightful 1836 map
                    of 
                        Indianapolis
                    .
            In August, 1852, Charles H. Beach, an engineer, came from the East to survey a route for the 
                        Ohio
                     and 
                        Mississippi
                     Railroad Company through Lawrence and adjoining counties. His seventy-nine page journal
                    gives a minute account of his work and experiences during the three months spent on the job.
            Trips through northwestem Indiana, around the southern edge of Lake Michigan, in
                    1831 and 1833 are recorded in parts of the diary of Amasa C. Washburn, which were secured in
                    microfilm.
            Papers of John K. Graham, prominent early Indianian, which are being gathered from various
                    descendants and other sources by Mrs. S. L. Mouser, are being filmed.
            The diary of George Faucett, of 
                        Orange County
                    , 1851 to 1862, also has been filmed.
            Several items of Owen and 
                        New Harmony
                     interest have been added. Robert Owen in an address at the 
                        Franklin
                     Institute, 
                        Philadelphia
                    , June 25, 1827, tells of his purposes at 
                        New Harmony
                     and something of the success and difficulties of the venture. He explains at length his
                    disagreement with William Maclure over business matters and answers some questions concerning his
                    views and their practical application. Two volumes, one and three, 1827 and 1828, of the Correspondmt contain considerable Owen and 
                        New Harmony
                     material. William Gibbon's Exposition of modem
                        skepticism…addressed to the Editors of the Free Enquirer (1830) is a 
                        Quaker
                     criticism of the ideas of the Owens and Frances Wright.
            The Altar of peace is a "discourse" delivered by Morgan  J. Rhees, a Welsh minister, at Greenville, July 5, 1795, before
                    Gen. 
                        Wayne
                     and the army officers there to effect a treaty with the Indians. It shows a discerning,
                    sympathetic, and intelligent attitude toward the Indian problem.
            
               Traits of Indian character, a two-volume work of 1836 by George Turner, who, as a
                    judge of the Northwest Territory, had had opportunity to know the Indians of the region, contains

            A HOOSIER INVADES THE CONFEDERACY
            Letters and Diaries of Leroy S. Mayfield
            Contributed by Ura Sanders
            Edited by John D. Barnhart
            The life of an Indiana soldier in the Civil War is intimately pictured in the diary and letters of
                    Leroy S. Mayfield. Marching and sleeping in the rain, pulling the wagon trains up Lookout Mountain,
                    witnessing the execution of deserters, foraging for food, encouraging a brother to get an education
                    before enlisting, protesting the high prices charged by army sutlers—"the army
                    pest" as he termed them, lying in the hospitals when wounded, and busying the body of a
                    loved and respected officer are a few of the intimate details which he describes.
            The contribution of Indiana to the national armies in the western theatre of the War Between the
                    States is also reflected in these writings. Mayfield was one of many representatives of the loyal
                    citizenry of southern Indiana. No word of complaint against his higher officers, no grumbling about
                    long, hard marches or short rations, and no flinching in his loyal devotion to the Union was
                    recorded, not even when he lay wounded on the field of battle for thirty-six hours. He was in the
                    army for a purpose and he intended to stay until that purpose was accomplished, if his life were
                    spared. His cousin, Copernicus H. Coffey, and his brother Joseph, were killed and he was severely
                    wounded—events which testify to the loyalty of his family.
            Conditions described covered such a wide field as to be fairly representative of the western area.
                    Mayfield served in the trans-
                        Mississippi
                     in 
                        Missouri
                     and 
                        Arkansas
                    , in the campaigns in 
                        Kentucky
                     and 
                        Tennessee
                     against General Braxton Bragg, in the 
                        Chattanooga
                     area, and in the invasion of 
                        Georgia
                     by the forces of General William T. Sherman. He was wounded in the famous charge up
                    Missionary Ridge and again in the battle of Kenesaw Mountain.
            A native of 
                        Monroe County
                    , Indiana, where he was born July 16, 1841, Mayfield was a student at 
                        Franklin
                     College during the winter of 1860–1861. He joined the Twenty-Second Regiment
                    of Indiana Volunteers when it was organized at 
                        Madison
                    , Indiana, July 15, 1861, and accompanied it to 
                    
                        Missouri
                     in August.1 He was commissioned a second lieutenant, February 14,
                    1863, and captain, September 15, 1864. He served until the end of the war and moved with the
                    regiment through 
                        Virginia
                     to 
                        Washington, D.C.
                    , and thence to 
                        Indianapolis
                     in June, 1865.
            The writings of Mayfield consist of thirty-four letters to his brother Joseph and two diaries,
                    written while in the field or shortly before he enlisted. There is no evidence that he anticipated
                    that any part of them would be published. They were written hurriedly and sometimes under conditions
                    that made writing difficult. The usual defects of such material are present, such as incorrect
                    spelling, very peculiar punctuation, and grammatical errors. It is impossible to be certain about
                    capitalization and often to tell where a new sentence begins. The writings have been reproduced as
                    faithfully as possible and without change. For reasons of space many remarks about the weather and
                    advice to his younger brother about his education and about writing were omitted. The original
                    letters and diaries are in the possession of Miss Ura Sanders, of Gosport, Indiana. Typewritten
                    copies are in the library of Indiana University, 
                        Bloomington
                    , Indiana.

            The first group of letters was written from Camp Noble, near 
                        Madison
                    , Indiana, where the regiment was organized, and from the trans-
                        Mississippi
                    , where the troops got their first experience in warfare. The letters give only a few
                    interesting sidelights on life in camp and on campaigning. Actually, the Twenty-Second Indiana
                    Infantry was engaged in the campaigns in 
                        Missouri
                     which culminated in the defeat of the Confederate forces at the battle of Pea Ridge, in
                    northwestern 
                        Arkansas
                    , March 7 and 8, 1862.

                        I arrived here yesterday after-noon amidst the most deafening cheers that I ever
                                    heard on any occasion. the boys came runing, between 500 and 800 in number, to meet
                                    their friends, to see who had come. We had a toilsome journey, in consequence of
                                    mis-connection, caused by change of time, on the roads. We arrived at 
                                        Mitchell
                                     about 5 o'clock in the afternoon and had to remain until one
                                    at night. We then started for North 
                                        Madison
                                    , arriving there at 3 o'clock in the morning, where we lay down
                                    on the floor of the Depot, and remained until day. I slept almost none during our
                                    passage.
                        We have as nice, if not the nicest camp, in the state. our sleeping rooms are good,
                                    and very good, compared with those of many other camps….
                        Our camp is in sight of 
                                        Kentucky
                                    , but we can not [see] the Ohio-River, becaus it is
                                    behind the hills, and timber
                        I went down to the River this afternoon, and took a swim. you may rest assured that
                                    it is a nice business. After we get fairly organized, we will be kept pretty close.
                                    I have not been out on guard as Yet
                        18th This morning I was placed on guard, and also C. H. Coffey, and we had, by no
                                    means, an easy time, having to wait until near 2 o'clock for dinner. Our
                                    Company has gone to the river to day. James, Whisenand, and James, Fenley, came down
                                    with us on monday. The boys, generaly appear to be well satisfied, though one of our
                                    company, "took a fence furlow," that is, he broke guard, crossed
                                    the fence, and has gone home….I think that our officers will be good to
                                    us. We have music plenty, and to spare.
                        Oh! yes, while I think of it, I saw a Woman a few moments since. There is no [use] to
                                    try to tell you what all is going on in camp continualy. it would take more than a
                                    dozen sheets of paper to contain it.
                        My mess mates are, J. T. Eller, J. W. Eller, Wm. Robertson, Henry Huston, and a young

                        Having heard that you anticipated, taking free passage in this direction, this week,
                                    I thought that it would [be] expedient to inform you something about what to bring
                                    with you if you do come….
                        Be sure and bring your shawl, two Coats (,Summer) two Shirts, and as much as two
                                    pairs of socks, and also some for me. And as many other little things as sou wish to
                                    bring with you. I wish you to bring a hickory shirt for me, if I have a new one at
                                    home….
                        It is an awful hard place….We have plenty to eat, but it is not always of

                                    , he wanted rifles, therefore we have to wait, not knowing which we will
                                    get. We have to walk to the "chalk line" now, in drilling, we have
                                    to drill several hours every day and sunday to. The Col is so wicked, and hard
                                    hearted that he will not allow a Chaplain, to preach for this regiment. he also will

                                     papers state that there are 30,000 troops within an hours ride of that
                                    place….Our camp is in the edge of the City, about three and a half miles
                                    from where we landed. we marched out here last Saturday, and bearly had [time] to
                                    "pitch" tents before night, and then prepare supper after night,
                                    of what vegetables we had bought during the day. We drew no bread, therefore had
                                    none save that which we bought.
                        Health is reasonably good in camp at present. Quite a number are complaining a
                                    little, which is nothing unreasonable, considering the way we have to ly on the
                                    ground. I suppose that I will get along all right, if I do not get homesick. I am
                                    very well satisfied as yet….

                        Yours of the 20th was received day before yesterday, just as we were preparing to go
                                    out on "picket" guard. we did not return until last night,
                                    consequently, had no chance to write. We, (5 of our mess) were out about 5 miles
                                    from camp. we had a very pleasant time except that it rained to hard while we were
                                    out. we got plenty of fruit to eat, and to bring into camp with us. I carried two
                                    "haversacks" full of provisions, one full of
                                    "fresh" pork, and the other full of apples. W[h]en I got into
                                    camp, and cooled, I could not use my right arm, so you may know that we have very
                                    plenty eat now for a few days if the secessionists do not break in upon us and take
                                    what we have. we also met with a chance to exchange coffee (which we had saved of
                                    our rations) for corn-meal, (which makes cakes, when fried, equal to sweet cakes at
                                    home. They are clearing off a battle ground (today), on a hill, where we will [have
                                    the] advantage of the rebels. I think the principle object, is, to have a good
                                    position for the "artillery." There are various reports, now
                                    afloat, in regard to the position of the rebels, but no one, is known to be true. It
                                    is now reported that they are on two sides of us. we do not believe it.
                        We know not one hour, what we will have to do the next….

                        ….we had got so well fixed to live at Otterville, that I hated very bad to
                                    leave, but I am now very well satisfied….we have now  been on the march 9 days or rather on the road, for we
                                    lay by 3 days of the time….Thursday night we made down on the snow and
                                    slept when we could, which was not a great deal, by any means. The country through
                                    which we have passed for 4 or 5 days is the most complete wilderness that I ever saw (

                                    few that lived on the road looked very much like starving. If I could see you, I
                                    could tell some hard soldier tales that I car, not write….

                                        White rivers, near where they unite. there were a few
                                    hundred secessionists in this part of the country, but they fled as has been their
                                    custom. This is a beatiful country and the citizens appear very friendly. Some are
                                    so through fear, others are truly so at heart. I have been out in the country, and
                                    became somewhat acquainted with a few of the citizens, one of whom is a Minister of
                                    the Gospel, a Missionary Baptist. I have just returned to camp, from a visit to his
                                    house. if we remain here until sabbath I shall go to hear him preach. The weather is
                                    very warm, although we have a nice shaded camp, in a thickly timbered grove. the
                                    wood, ticks….are so annoying, that we can scarcely rest, at
                                    all….There is, or was plenty of provisions in the country before we came
                                    here. the boys have plenty of money and are not afraid to use it.
                        Our pay-roll has been made out. we will not likely receive pay for a month or more. A
                                    dispatch has come, announcing the federal possession of New-Orleans, by Gen Butlers
                                    forces. we do not know whether true or not. Steam-bcats run up white-river above
                                    this point, but they do not risk the enterprise now. When the

                                     evacuated, boats can run up the river to us very handily. Health is
                                    very good in the army at present, considering the nice time we have had wading
                                    rivers and smaller, streams. On last Saturday we marched 25 miles, through rain and
                                    mud, without grub.
                        ….I hope the time is not far distant, when the rebellion will be crushed

                     campaign, the Twenty-Second Indiana Infantry was sent to aid in the siege of Corinth, 
                        Mississippi
                    , following which it was transferred to the army of General D. C. Buell in 
                        Tennessee
                    . This service culminated in the battle of Perryville, in 
                        Kentucky
                    , October 8, 1362, when General Braxton Bragg's invaslon of 
                        Kentucky
                     was checked. Mayfield's letters were largely confined to little affairs that
                    lightened the more arduous military labors. Unfortunately, he wrote little about the battle of
                    Perryville.

                        ….We have been stiring about, for more than a week and lying out without
                                    our tents, which we have practiced so much lately, as to become very familiar with
                                    it. The weather is very warm. the sand heats in the roads, so as to make it very
                                    disagreeable marching in it.
                        There were about 200 rebel cavalry, (Cotton burners) here at this town night before
                                    last but they have gone far beyond our reach. They are traveling the country over,
                                    and burning all the cotton they can find, to prevent its falling into our hands as
                                    they pretend to think that we are out stealing cotton, but I hope they will soon
                                    find our mission quite a differ[ent] one. The citizens in this part of the country
                                    show there contempt to the "old flag" in various ways. yesterday
                                    as we marched through town some of the Ladies hid their faces while the
                                    "colors" were passing near them….

                        As official reports will not give the minute details of the performances of the 22nd
                                    for the last 2 or 3 weeks, I will write to you. On the 1st of Oct Father and I
                                    parted on the streets of 
                                        Louisville
                                     and we marched out in pursuit of the enemy. To me, it was a matter of
                                    no little weight, to separate at that time As a matter of course, I was a little
                                    "home-sick" for a time hut not dangerously so. I had some very
                                    hard labor to perform, for more than a week during the absence of the boys. I bore
                                    it all with pleasure, hoping that they were enjoying themselves finely. three of the
                                    boys have not yet returned. A. C. Ranard is absent yet. After marching two days from 
                                        Louisville
                                    , skirmishing with the enemies pickets and rear guard, was kept up every
                                    day. they gradualy gave back until they arrived near Perryville where they halted to
                                    give battle.
                        We were not called into action until Wednesday afternoon. marched onto the battle
                                    ground under a heavy fire, formed, which was, but the work of a moment, and began
                                    the deadly work. we were not engaged more than 21/2 hours, the average of shot I
                                    think was not far, from 15 rounds. our position on the field was changed three or
                                    four times, this of course hindered us from shooting so much as we would, had we
                                    been stationed that length of time. The boys, almost without exception, behaved
                                    nobly. it appeared that all fear had gone, and every one determined to sell his life
                                    dearly as possible. J. H. Pettus fell, as "Soldier," a
                                    "brave" boy" he received two shots. While the battle was
                                    raging with fury, and the balls singing about over head like a swarm of bees, his
                                    gun was struck by a ball, which glanced and "grazed" the side of
                                    his head. He raised his gun, and coolly remarked to his comrade, "If I live
                                    to get home, I shall take this gun with me," then  raised the gun to his shoulder, took deliberate aim,
                                    and fired. this is one instance, of the many that I might mention, of coolness, that
                                    occured during the battle. Many of the boys received shots through their clothing,
                                    some: many as three or four shots. Neither C. H. nor I received a mark of any
                                    discription. The dead! how thick they lay. The wounded! how awful their groans. Oh!
                                    may I never see such a sight, nor hear such groans again, as those witnessed on that
                                    bloody: "little spot." At the same time, the enemies loss was
                                    very, very: heavy. many of the rebel dead lay on the field for days before they were
                                    buried.
                        Our regimental "colors" were torne to strings and the bearer shot,
                                    another gathered the staff and he to was shot, so in the darkness they were lost. I
                                    never before saw darkness come over the land sudden as it did at that time. the
                                    thickness of the smoke caused it.
                        Our health is good. Copernicu's visit home, did him a great deal of good.
                                    his health has been better since, than it was for months before. I do not want you
                                    to enlist again. two for three years and one for three months is enough for one
                                    family to furnish during this war. If I felt that affairs were being conducted
                                    right, I should not object to your enlisting again, but as it is I want you to
                                    remain out of bondage….

                                    were about 150 prisoners brought in last night. they were taken near Wild-cat. They
                                    appear very tired of the service. some say that they would rather be shot than to

                        ….Night before last some of our officers were fired at, by some rebels. we
                                    Co (I) were ordered out on "picket guard" immediately, we were
                                    posted about 21/2 miles from camp, in plain view of the rebels picket's
                                    fires. we returned to camp about noon Sabbath, but about 3 o'clock in the
                                    afternoon the alarm, was raised and in a few moments the division was ready to move
                                    forward, with the expectations of a contest with the rebels, but the alarm proved to
                                    be unfounded, and we returned to camp by nine at night. soon after, it began to rain
                                    tremendous fast, and continued so until late at night This afternoon the 22d was
                                    ordered out to reconnoiter the hights in front, and try the strength of the enemy,
                                    if any at, all. after traveling 3 or 4 miles, returned to camp finding no enemy.
                                    There has been some cannonaiding, on our left to day, but I as yet know either the
                                    cause or the result. It is expected that we will have something to do, soon as the
                                    army begins a forward move, which, I think will not be, for a time yet. The rebels
                                    are no dout, fortifying, and preparing themselves to meet us, and give battle at
                                    Murphreesboro Tenn. 30 miles distant from 
                                        Nashville
                                    . My opinion is that their hopes will be vain. On the 28th we crossed
                                    the river and camped three miles south of 
                                        Nashville
                                    . have a very nice, camp.
                        An order was issued a few days, since, requiring the men to make rails and repair a
                                    fence, partialy destroyed, by themselves, but the  boys declared that they were "soldiers" and that soldier would
                                    not "work", consequently the fence is not repaired.
                        I am much [pleased] to know that [you] are attending school, instead of fretting to
                                    partake of a soldiers hardship's and miseries, winter is much worse than
                                    summer. with some exceptions we have had very nice weather for a time. Copernicus
                                    and I, are in good health except that he has cold. he and I are alone messing
                                    together. Lieut Marshall took us into his tent, as the company has not a very
                                    liberal supply. Lieut Ravenseroft was detailed as military conductor, on the 
                                        Louisville
                                     and

                                    sid[e] our camp, four of the cars ran off, one of [them] turned over down the fill,
                                    to it's original position. He jumped off and was making his escape, when
                                    the trucks caught him, and were lying on him [when] the boys got to his relief. it
                                    was very difficult to remove them off of him. his excape is "one",
                                    of a thousand: his sword and belt which were on, were broken to pieces. he is geting
                                    along well, and proves to be slightly injured. I did not learn how many were hurt,
                                    but evidently quite a number were injured.
                        There is some prospect of geting a little pay here, two months wages, of five that is
                                    due. Signed the "pay roll" yesterday Our chaplain, E. P. F. Wells,
                                    has resigned. A he started home this morning. A chaplain in the army, is usualy of
                                    little force except to attend to the mail. I suppose the reason is, that the most
                                    worthless prechers, those who can not make a good living at home, are the ones who
                                    strive to secure the position for the money. many chaplains in the army have proved
                                    to be very reckless. Our chaplain did very well except that he did not preach very
                                    often….

                                    southward, expecting to press forward and ingage the enemy before night. the morning
                                    was cold, but we camped 3 or 4 miles south of nashville, but no enemy was seen. we
                                    had a great deal of picket duty to do—while in that camp. we were out on

            III Rosecrans' 
                            Chattanooga
                         Campaign
            
            After the battle of Perryville, the Twenty-Second moved inco 
                        Tennessee
                     and became a part of the army of General William S. Rosecrans. At the turn of the year
                    there occurred the battle of Murfreesboro or Stone's River, December
                    31, 1862-January 2, 1863. The army remained in this vicinity until Rosecrans began his campaign
                    against 
                        Chattanooga
                    . From camp at 
                        Winchester
                    , 
                        Tennessee
                    , the advance began, the Twenty-Second going via Stevenson and Bridgeport, 
                        Alabama
                    . At the latter place the Tennessee River was crossed and nearly
                    three weeks, August 31-September 20, were spent in the mountains to the east, guarding the right of
                    Rosecrans's forces. Crossing Lookout Mountain, the Twenty-Second viewed the defeat of
                    Rosecrans at Chickamauga from the summit. Cut off by the retreat of Rosecrans to 
                        Chattanooga
                    , the regiment was in serious danger of being captured; but it managed to rejoin the
                    main army.
            Several letters tell about Mayfield's experiences in 
                        Tennessee
                    , the one of April 14 giving a brief description of his regiment's part in the
                    battle of Stone's River. His first diary begins August 17, 1863,
                    giving a connected account of his military activities from that date to the end of this period.
            Further information on this campaign will be found in the report of Brigadier General Jeff. C. Davis,
                    covering the operations from August 28 to September 20, in Official Records,
                    Series I, Vol. XXX, Part 1, pp. 496–503. See also the report of Colonel P. Sidney Post,

                    the Twenty-Second Indiana Volunteer Infantry, ibid., 513–14.

                                    forage. The morning was beautiful, but early in the day, it clouded up, and began to
                                    rain, very fast continueing so the remainder of the day. The water in many places,
                                    was knee deep, and in othrers much deeper, if we had searched for the bottom. We
                                    marched 8 miles on "quick," and double quick" time
                                    without halting. I did not get very much wearied. Were out in front 9 or 10 miles
                                    South [of] town. the reb's annoyed us a little, but did not do any special
                                    injury. we would have had a brisk skirmish, had it not been for the darkness, caused
                                         by the fast falling rain. the rebs brought
                                    a battery in to position, threw a few shells, which were heartily replied to.
                        Yesterday (the 22d) was the birth day of Gen. George 
                                        Washington
                                    . One battery in each Division was ordered to fire, a "National
                                    salute," at or about sunset. it almost made the earth quake like unto a
                                    battle. I do not like the sound of cannon very well, but I am in no way disposed to
                                    run from them, "not boasting in any way at all." Immediately after
                                    the rain ceased it turned very cold, and the ground frozed pretty hard on top, but
                                    to day it has been tolerably pleasant.
                        The 82d is camped east of town. I have not been over to see them since we came here.
                                    Jessee was over a few weeks since, but I have not seen any of them lately. We have
                                    something…new again, in camp. Gen Rosecrans, has ordered one Commissioned
                                    officer, two Seg'ts three corporals, and thirty privates, to be chosen by
                                    ballot, of the best and bravest men, in the Regiment, to form a company of men to be
                                    mounted, and armed with the most efficient arms that can be procured. It is supposed
                                    that they will be bold, energetic, and brave men; men of daring deeds. Four of the
                                    Pea-ridge heroes, who stood the battle through without flinching, were chosen, and
                                    two others who were absent sick at the time, but have proved themselves since, to be
                                    worthy of any position of honor. their names are as follows, Corporal, Wm. H. H.
                                    Walden, Privates, James M. Whisenand, Wm. B. Cooper, Austin Slochem, R. S. Curry,
                                    Wm. Southern. they are boys who will fight. I think that they will do good service
                                    in field after they get horses. James Whisenand is a good fellow, full of fun, as
                                    any fellow can be, and is "number one" soldier. We have not
                                    drilled a great deal, since we camped at this place. There has been so much mud. to
                                    day we went out to drill. after drilling in the "manual of arms"
                                    for a time, we stacked arms, and entered into a spirited engagement, "after
                                    the old style of boys play," throwing wet corn cobs. the company pretty
                                    well divided, had quite a "jolly" time, you may think strange that
                                    I take so much pleasure, in boy's play's, but you need not, for I
                                    am more boyish to day than I was four years ago! I am very fleshy now. my weight is
                                    184 Ibs. all told: Health good, the health of the company is very good. have no
                                    sick, out of 101 men, 61 are left to be accounted for in the company, the remaining
                                    40 are dead, discharged, and transferred. My business suits me very well. I have
                                    plenty to do, and always acquainted with the company affairs.
                        The Paymaster is present, paying the second brigade. it will soon come time for the
                                    first Brigade. we will likely get four months pay. I do not know that I shall send
                                    much home this time, it will depend on circumstances….
                        We have a Chaplain, a good preacher, I suppose, of the Episcopalian order. he is a
                                    refugee from 
                                        Texas
                                    , driven away by the rebels for his union sentiments….

                        …we have just returned from another "scouting"
                                    expedition in the direction of 
                                        Franklin
                                     Tenn….Soldiers life is not very regular perhapse for a day
                                    or week or month, he may be over-run  with duty,
                                    at other times he may have nothing to do, and will become lazy, but it has been my
                                    lot for a few months past, to have plenty of labor to perform, of various kinds. I
                                    made a calculation a few days since of the amount of clothing (beside numerous other
                                    articles of Camp and Garrison equippage riot valued,) that I have drawn on Special
                                    Requisitions and issued to the men, of the company, (booking the same,) within three
                                    and a half months, The value of which was $870.00. I was surprised to
                                    know that I had handled and kept an account of clothing to that amount, beside
                                    drawing and issueing rations, which are usualy drawn, five days at a
                                    time….
                        We pass some days very pleasantly, but usualy have some duty to perform that is not
                                    so pleasant as it might be, when exposed to rain and mud, chilled and dirty, all
                                    taken together very disagreeable. In all our traveling lately we have not got a shot
                                    at any of the rebels. We have drawn new guns again, have the (Enfield Rifle), now.
                                    All is quiet in this Department.

                                    April 14th 1863
                                
                        ….the dust on our drill ground had become almost intolerable. there are
                                    about five brigades and so many batteries that use this large open field to drill
                                    upon Our Regiment can drill very well, but they are a stubborn set of fellows, and
                                    when they get a little mad, they can perform worse than any new regiment that I ever
                                    saw try to perform, in any way.
                        …I had to go on inspection, and immediately after this was over went to
                                    the officers school, which is conducted by the Colonel, who asks questions as school
                                    teachers do in other branches of study, it is very intereting to me. I need
                                    instruction in any business that I undertake, as boys always do.
                        We yet have a considerable amount of duty to perform,—enough to keep us
                                    healthy. exercise proves to be a necessary requisite to health in the army. There is
                                    a limated amount of sickness in the regiment now. We have taken so much care in
                                    cleansing, grading, and planting bushy cedars in the quarters, that I thing there
                                    will not be much cause for sickness. I fear that the dead animals, which abound so
                                    plentifully in this region, will give some cause [for] sickness. Last Sabbath I was
                                    out near the "Old Battle Ground," on picket duty. It brought to
                                    mind scenes to vivid to ever be entirely forgotten.2 there
                                    within a mile of [the] "spot" on which we stood picket guard, the
                                    night before that awful days fight, (I mean the day that we were driven backe) after
                                    the firing had continued at intervals near all night, I awoke at early dawn, almost
                                    froze, to hear the whistle of the "minie" balls and see the rebel
                                    columns advancing upon us, across an open space. Imagine our feelings for one
                                    moment—in the face of a largely superious force,—to know that
                                    in five minutes, nay! less time! that the deadly conflict must begin. there we stood
                                    firm, not knowing but that five minutes, of time might reveal an endless eternity,
                                    but soon the order came to fall back a short distance and form a new line of battle
                                    as the Division on our right, (Johnsons) had 
                              
                                 2 The remainder of the paragraph refers to the battle
                                            of Stone's River, which occurred December 31,
                                            1862-January 2, 1863.
                           
                                     been surprised and routed after some hard
                                    fighting. we then were to bear the brunt of the flowing tide. These came to mind
                                    anew, but it's being outside the picket line I could not visit the place.

                                    Segt" he fills his place well. Robert. S. Curry is a sergeant in the
                                    company now, since Captain Lunderman left us. Wm. B. Miller, a brother to Robert
                                    Strongs wife, is Orderly Segt.
                        The boys are having quite a pleasant time as usual, runing each other, and
                                    "scuffling"—playing like some little boys and I would
                                    certainly be with them if I was not writing.
                        You asked me at one time whether I had received any valentines. I received one it was
                                    a good one too, but it happened to have a neame signed. Gov Morton is not ashamed of

                                    is constructed across the river at this point, that deserves  the admiration of man. Thus 450 yards of water were

                                    played off a nice joke, by pretending to be throwing a pontoon bridge across at
                                    Bridge Port, and in the mean time put them over 15 miles below, thus flanking their

                                    which was but 1/2 mile distant; and 1 1/2 miles high and very rough, steep and

                                    far and wide, is within one grasp of the eye. We march forward a distance of two

                                     having been evacuated by the rebels, the cavalry expedition was ordered
                                    to halt. and we received orders to march to the top of the Mountain at 2 P. M.
                                    Ascended to the top of Lookout Mountain about 2 miles distant, the hill being about
                                    one mile long, pretty steep, hut the roads were very good to be situated on such a

                                    father of Mountains. The scene was one of beauty and splendor almost insurpassable.
                                    From a clift of stone 80 or 90 feet high, could be seen 6 or 7 mountain
                                    ranges,—far as the eye could reach. The beautiful valleys through which
                                    flows the mountain streams, and which are so fertile, are visible  north and south to the extent of the eye's.
                                    Wagon trains ascending the hill all night, a detail sent from the regiment to assist

                                    was done in admirable style—every man carrying his load of Potatoes with
                                    him. Got into camp a little after dark, near the beautiful spring at Valley Head.
                                    Had quite a pleasant bed, formed of

                                    head quarters of Brig. Returned at night well loaded with corn.
                        September 14, Monday…..dust almost intolerable in the roads, over which
                                    there has been so much travel. McCooks Corps returned to Lookout valley, for the

                                    rebels reported to be runing again. First Brig. to which 22nd Ind belongs Ordered to

                        a.m. to be ready to march soon as rations could be issued. It is said that we are to

                                            refer to the preparations being made by Rosecrans in anticipation of the
                                            battle which occurred at Chickamauga on the 19th of September.
                           
                                     men wearied and worn down by ma[r]ching over
                                    such a stony country after night….my bed of sand-stone not very
                                    entertaining.
                        September 19, Saturday. Arose early in the morning feeling considerably worse
                                    of' the wear. Marched two miles, halting on the eastern sumit of Lookout
                                    Montains, at a place eight miles north-west of Lafeyett 
                                        Georgia
                                    , and 23 miles North-east of Valley Head Ala. The country over which
                                    this road passes is very rough, stony, poor, and seldom any signs of cultivation,
                                    also poorly watered with nothing of an inviting character. In the Valley east of us,
                                    which is deep and broad, and overlooked by the mountain hights, is massed Rose-cram
                                    army, and a short distance beyond lies the army of Gen Bragg. The firing of
                                    artillery some 12 or 15 miles distant can be distinctly heard. The clouds of dust
                                    and the smoke from the small arms: which were distinctly visible, told that a
                                    terrible battle was in progress: the result of which we eagerly wished to know, but
                                    being so far behind the army, could not get the result. The night was spent on the
                                    summit of this the roughest: of rough mountains….(letter,

                                    to meet the enemy, but he never came….
                        September 20, Sabbath. Marched early in the morning, decending the mountain, which
                                    was about two miles length, very steep rough and crooked. marched northward in the
                                    trail of the main army. crossing Missionary ridge and passing various qualities of
                                    country, none very superior in quality. the whole country was laid waste by the
                                    contending armies: About 12. M. our advance was fired into by some rebel scouts. we
                                    soon formed to give battle expecting to fight out way through the rebel army far as
                                    we could: knowing at the same time that they had the 1st Brigade cut off from the
                                    army: and that we were at their mercy. But they: misconstruing: our approach: for
                                    the arrival of reinforcements: with-held their assault, after failing in one

                                    place we arrived, at 2, P. M. having marched 20 miles. Joy was engraved in every
                                    countenance,—us at our delivery from the clutches of the
                                    enemy,—the Cavalry at the appearance of assistance, which was very much
                                    needed at that moment. The Brigade being cut off from the Division, reported to the
                                    Cavalry commander, with which we remained. At Crawfish Springs, there was a very
                                    large hospital and a number of wounded, which were being re-moved fast as possible,
                                    while we were lying in line of battle to meet the enemy. At 4, P. M. again resumed
                                    the march northward, (leaving some of our wounded behind, but Surgeons, medicines,
                                    nurses, and Provisions, were left with them,) passed through a gap in Mission Ridge,
                                    entering the valley at root of Lookout Mountain, through which we coursed our way
                                    northward. Rebels followed close on our rear. Halted at night drew rations, and lay
                                    by fires, (night being very cold,) until about 11, P. M. marched slowly on a
                                    distance of  5 or 6 miles, halting 1
                                    o'clock at night, to repose on the cold ground, with no beding save
                                    what…we carried. Frosted heavy during the night. We were in hearing of
                                    the artillery all day, and had reason to believe that our condition was a critical
                                    one.
                        September 21, Monday. Arose in the morning. all appeared quiet, no cannonading to be
                                    heard. we advanced a short distance southward to a good position, and there formed
                                    to await the approach of the rebbels, who did not appear. here the night was
                                    spent….
                        September 22, Tuesday. Awoke at 3, a.m. and marched north 2 miles. halted got
                                    breakfast by day-light, and again formed across the valley, and hastily prepared of
                                    rails and stone; some works for defense and protection. Marched from this position
                                    shortly after noon, when within two miles of 
                                        Chattanooga
                                     our flank was so hard pressed that escape appeared almost impossible.
                                    again was the Brigade formed for the purpose of self defense, while our Battery
                                    amused itself with shelling them for a time, whereupon they gave us a passway.
                                    Marched forward along the road, the rebels shelling us, to the best of their
                                    ability, which proved not to be very good as no one was hurt. Crossed Chickamauga
                                    Creek: (about one mile from 
                                        Chattanooga
                                    , at 3 o'clock, P. M., along which we formed, and immediately
                                    began to dig—to fortify: Co "I" was detailed on picket.
                                    The rebels kept a continuous Shelling the remainder of the day to prevent our
                                    working. Our artillery did not reply often.
                        September 23, Wednesday. Work progressed speedily on the works to day. All are
                                    interested in the ditches, as "life preservers" Relieved from
                                    picket at 3, P. M. About 100 shots fired from our artillery during the day without a
                                    reply. After dark a heavy fight of musketry and artillery, ensued on the left of us,
                                    in front of Branans Div. which resulted in the death of many rebels and few of our
                                    men. all under arms during the excitement, which subcided about 10, P. M.
                        September 24, Thursday. Under arms very early. continuous skirmishing during the day
                                    also heavy cannonading on both sides. At 4, P. M. got orders, (the 22nd Ind.
                                    together with 74th Ill.) to reconnoiter in our front, to ascertain the strenght and
                                    position of the enemy. Co "I" deployed as skirmishers. had not
                                    proceeded far until the rebels began to stir—soon heavy skirmishing
                                    began. the 22nd lost one killed and severel wound. Co "I" had one
                                    Jas Kemper slightly wounded in shoulder after driving in, their skirmishers and
                                    learning their force, the expedition returned at night. At 11 1/2 o'clock
                                    at night, the rebels attacked the centre,—to our left. in a moment every
                                    man was to his post in the works. The firing was heavy for one hour, ceasing at 12
                                    1/2. The firing of artillery was heavy, and beautiful to behold. All became quiet
                                    and we retired to rest for the remainder of the night.
                        September 25, Friday. Up at 3 A. M. and moved back to the second line of works,
                                    leaving the outer line to be occupied by the "out post" pickets,
                                    we being the reserve in the 2 line. Heavy cannonading at intervals during the day.
                                    At night the rebels attacked Johnsons pickets,—to our right—a
                                    sharp engagement of about one hours duration ensued—resulting unfavorably
                                    to the rebels, they leaving severel dead and wounded near by our works. All fly to
                                    arms the moment  firing begins on the
                                    lines…Bed in the ditch—humble situation!
                        September 26, Saturday. Up at 4, a. m. Every thing quiet to day, save a few cannon
                                    shots: at each meal time during the day: from rebel Batteries, to make us get into
                                    the ditches. no harm done to any one at all….
                        September 27, Sabbath. The beautiful Sabbath morning dawned, and the calm peaceful
                                    air rests undisturbed, save by the sound of an occasional musket shot on the picket
                                    line: thus the day passed quietly by: A flag of "truce" was sent
                                    out to inquire after our wounded. At night, as usual, the rebels advanced in front
                                    of Johnsons Div. which was soon followed by a sharp skirmish, resulting favorably.
                        September 28, Monday…..A large Ambulance train passed out after wounded,
                                    between the picket lines. our Ambulance drivers were displaced: by the rebels who
                                    took them and returned to the same place the following day. Rebel Drums and Brass
                                    bands could be heard very distinctly this morning. no firing today.
                        September 29, Tuesday. All quiet on the lines. Brigade inspection at 8
                                    o'clock A. M. Ambulance train returned with wounded….
                        September 30, Wednesday. At 2 o'clock, a.m. the 22nd was ordered to the
                                    front: to relieve the 74 
                                        Ill 
                                    which was doing outpost picket duty. Had been assigned to our various
                                    positions, Co "I", as pickets, and all quiet. At the dawn of
                                    morning, our sentinels found that they were in very close proximity to those of the
                                    rebels, some of them even so near as 60 or 80 yards, all using water from the same
                                    stream, (Chickamauga) Could often see 20 or 30 rebels at one sight, and we took no
                                    care to keep ourselves concealed….(letter) They converse some and
                                    exchange papers occasionaly. can offten see 40 or 50 of them at one
                                    time….(October 3, 1863)
                        October 1, 1863, Thursday. On picket south side of Chickamauga creek, which is a deep
                                    dirty stream, with rugged steep banks. surrounding country level and beautiful, but
                                    laid waste by the ravages of war. Relieved from picket at 6 A. M. and returned a few
                                    rods to the works. rain continued all day, falling very fast at times, almost
                                    overflowing our resting place. At 11 o'clock at night rain ceased to fall,
                                    and it became very cola. Our blankets and clothing being wet, caused considerable
                                    suffering.
                        October 2, Friday….No disturbance on the line: the rebels
                                    moving—changing position: some apprehensions of an attack: but no
                                    demonstrations made….
                        October 3, Saturday. At 8 A. M. 1st Brigade was relieved by the 2nd (we having been
                                    on duty since the 22 of Sept.) returned to 3d line of works near the edge of town,
                                    about 3/4 of a mile from the Tennessee river. little of note
                                    transpired during the day.
                        October 4, Sabbath. I got a pass and crossed the river after my Velise have been
                                    separated form my clothing for more than two weeks….Many men suffer
                                    severely having lost their blankets in the battle. All quiet during the day save two
                                    cannon shots fired at noon.
                        October 5, Monday. The day passed off quietly, until about noon, when the rebels
                                    opened on our works, with their artillery from the side of Lookout Mountain The
                                    firing was continued pretty brisk, during the afternoon, and at intervals during the
                                    night: The Shot and  Shell droped very
                                    plentifuly about us. did but little injury, so far as heard from. Our batteries did
                                    not reply often.
                        October 6, Tuesday. Awoke early in the morning expecting the rebels to open on as
                                    with all their available artillery force, from the high commanding position they
                                    occupied on the side of Lookout Mountain: ranging from 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 miles distant,
                                    but there was so much fog and smoke as to almost obscure the Sun-light, until 10, A.
                                    M. and so much so as to render cannonading impracticable, and useless, for either
                                    party. And yesterdays experiments, revealed to then the fact that their artillery
                                    was or, a position so much elevated, as to render it harmless to us: and almost
                                    useless, to them: save the annoyance their Shells gave us. One Shot fired from Ft
                                    Negley at 3, P. M. no reply from the rebels….one shot fired after night,
                                    after which all was again quiet as usual, during the night.
                        October 7, Wednesday…..but few Shots fired from our Batteries, without a
                                    reply.
                        October 8, Thursday. Morning very smoky until 10, A. M. Our artillery practiced a
                                    little in the after-noon throwing shells at the rebels, but few shuts, in reply. Day
                                    passed by pleasantly, quite different from the 8 of Oct. one year since, at which
                                    time we were engaged in the Battle of Perryville, Ky. [October 8, 1862.]
                        October 9, Friday. Morning cool and frosty, so much fog in the air as to render it
                                    almost dark until 10 o'clock A. M. A detail of 100 at work on the Forts as
                                    usual. Living on half rations since 22nd Sept. in order to get a supply on hand to
                                    prevent suffering should communication, with our "base" of
                                    supplies be interrupted.5 A few Shots fired on the extreme right
                                    and centre: by our batteries, but were not replied to by the rebels. The rebel
                                    "Signal corps" on the summit of Lookout Mountain was seriously
                                    disturbed by the bursting of "Yankee Bomb's" in their
                                    immediate vicinity. All quiet along the Lines. I visited some of the wounded in
                                    hospitals it was realy gratifying to see them so cheerful and lively: yet
                                    distressing to see their condition—with legs, feet, arms and hand
                                    amputated, and wounds of every conceivable shape and form. They are being sent north
                                    fast as they are able, to go. their treatment is very good.
                        October 10, Saturday…..All quiet until noon, at which time a few shots
                                    were fired at "Lookout," and again at night a few more were filed,
                                    without receiving a reply from the rebel Batteries. At noon a detail, consisting of
                                    almost the entire regiment were sent out, to work on the forts….
                        October 11, Sabbath. At 8 A.M. the first Brigade went out on picket. the 22d Ind
                                    halted in the 2d line of works as a "reserve." A few Shots fired
                                    during the day from our batteries, situated on the north bank of the
                                        Tennessee river, that being on a very high point, in a bend
                                    of the river, near the rebel lines, and very near to, and opposite the point of
                                    Lookout Mountain….

                                            Chattanooga
                                         was very serious; and not until after he was relieved of the
                                        command were adequate means established for the supply of this army.
                        
                        
                        October 12, Monday. But few shots fired from our batteries during the day, none from
                                    the rebels….
                        October 13, Tuesday…..All quiet during the day.
                        October 14, Wednesday. Continued to rain during the day and night, in heavy torrents,
                                    together with severe wind, which blew "shelter-tents" in every
                                    direction. Men and all they posses wet—drowned out. The ditches full of
                                    water.
                        October 15, Thursday. At 6 o'clock, A. M. a detail of 112 men were sent to
                                    guard a train to Stevenson, 
                                        Alabama
                                     after "Rations"….Relieved from pick. at 2,
                                    P. M. and returned to the 3d line of works, to camp as best we could, being wet and
                                    mudy. Blankets and baggage as wet as the water which fell upon them. Wind blew heavy
                                    and cold, had no wood with which to make fires, suffered severely at night. Received
                                    orders for the Regt to be ready to go after forage at 7 A. M. on the morrow.
                        October 16, Friday. Marched out at 7, A. M. crossed the Tennessee
                                    river, (which was so much swollen by the late rains as to break the
                                    "pontoon bridge,") on…the Steamer "Paint
                                    Rock" Arrived at the train on the north bank of the river, and about 10 A.
                                    M. were found wending our way northward, over ridges and through valleys, having
                                    been assigned to our post,—4 men to a wagon. The valleys were very
                                    narrow, the country stony and not very fertile or beautiful. Passed some beautiful
                                    Mountain Streams. Camped for the night at Cole's Tavern, at the foot of the
                                    Mountain,—"Waldrons Ridge", 18 miles from 
                                        Chattanooga
                                    . the roads over which we passed were almost impassable….
                        October 17, Saturday…..At 12, M. ascended the hill, which was about a mile
                                    long, and very rough and steep. traveled about five miles on the mountain and
                                    camped, for the night.
                        October 18, Sabbath. Began the march early in the morning. it soon became cloudy and
                                    began to rain—rain with a vengeance. Thus we tuged our way across the
                                    mountain a distance of 12 miles, and down a distance of 3 miles, mud beyond
                                    discription. Having to wait often for other trains to pass, got along slow. The
                                    decent of the mountain was not very steep, but very rough, with stone and mud.
                                    Camped about 2 miles from the foot of the mountain, in Sequachie
                                    Valley….
                        October 19, Monday. The train moved early in the morning, up the Sequachie
                                        River which is a nice stream, not very large The valley is a
                                    beautiful one, very rich and well watered. the inhabitants are loyal. Arrived within
                                    three miles of Pikeville, Bledsoe Co. loaded our wagon [s], 75 in number, and camped
                                    for the night….
                        October 20, Tuesday. At 7 A. M. moved off slowly south-ward—retracing our
                                    steps. Roads pretty good, but rough….Camped at the foot of the mountain
                                    for the night.
                        October 21, Wednesday. Began to ascend the mountain at 6. reached the summit a
                                    distance of three miles, at 9 1/2, A. M….
                        October 22, Thursday…..Halted and camped for the night, at 2, P. M. the
                                    eastern pass of Waldrons Ridge being so full of wagons as to be impassable. were
                                    delayed in many places by meeting so many large wagon trains.
                        October 23, Friday. Was aroused at 4, A. M. by a sudden and  terrible hail Storm, which did not last long, but was
                                    followed by rain—rain without ceasing decended the mountain and traveled
                                    southward down the valley. camped within ten miles of 
                                        Chattanooga
                                    . Roads very mudy….
                     
                  
               
                
            IV Camp Life at 
                            Chattanooga
                        : Missionary Ridge
            
            Rosecrans was relieved of his command after Chickamauga and the retreat to 
                        Chattanooga
                    . Ulysses S. Grant was placed in charge of all forces between the Alleghenies and the 
                        Mississippi
                    , and General George H. Thomas was given command of the Army of the 
                        Cumberland
                    . The forces were strengthened, the supply problem greatly improved, and the offensive
                    resumed. The battle of Lookout Mountain and the charge up Missionary Ridge brought success to these
                    efforts.
            The effect of these changes appears in the diary for October 24, 1863. The diary and five letters
                    give a highly interesting and intimate account of this significant part of the war, including the
                    battles of Lookout Mountain and Missionary Ridge. The Twenty-Second took part in the latter and
                    Lieutenant Mayfield was among the soldiers wounded at this time. His descriptions of life in camp,
                    of the execution of deserters, and of the battle and battlefield are among the best passages found
                    in his letters and diaries.
            The report of Major General Ulysses S. Grant for the period covered by this portion of the diary may
                    be found in Official Recods, Series I, Vol. XXXI, Part 2, pp. 27–37.
                    Colonel Michael Gooding, commanding the Twenty-Second Indiana Infantry, cited Mayfield in his report
                    of November 27, 1863, ibid., 204–06.
            
                    
                  
                     
                        October 24, Saturday. Arrived at 
                                        Chattanooga
                                     about 3, P. M. having traveled 100 miles through rain and mud. were
                                    gone 9 days, on three days rations; and returned to find our brigade disbanded, and
                                    shifted to other commands, the 20th & 21st Army Corps having been
                                    consolidated, forming the 4th Corps, Comded by Gordon Granger. The 22nd Ind was
                                    placed in the 1st Brig. comded by Brig Gen Stead-man, and 2nd Division comded by
                                    Major Gen Sheridan, on the whole the change was very agreeable. I am quite well
                                    pleased….Began to make preparations to camp in good order, for the first
                                    time since entering 
                                        Chattanooga
                                    ….
                        October 25, Sabbath. I enjoyed the company of a wool blanket, not having slept with a
                                    blanket for more than a week. I was on duty all day with a large detail, diching and
                                    policing regimental parade ground, day passed off quietly.
                        
                        October 26, Monday….the day was occupied in hauling lumber, and brick, and
                                    building sheds with chimneys attached. the late frosts give the men a will to work
                                    for comfort. At night an expedition, 2 Brigades under Gen Baird started down the
                                        Tenn river to get possession of some hights on the south
                                    side of the river. They succeeded well.
                        October 27, Tuesday….time still occupied in ereting sheds or houses for
                                    comfort. Have a very nice little residence, for the accommodation of four, with good
                                    bunks and an "old-fashioned" "fire place" all
                                    very comfortably situated, at present Heavy cannonading heard during the day down
                                    the river, fighting is going on in that direction….
                        October 28, Wednesday…..Rebels very quiet in front. Heavy cannonading
                                    during the entire day in the direction of Lookout Mountain and Racoon Ridge. From 1
                                    to 3 o'clock at night, there was heavy fighting with artillery and musketry
                                    on the extreme right. Rumors afloat that our forces were successful in the night
                                    fighting, dislodging the rebels from their position.
                        October 29, Thursday. Cannonading continued all day from Lookcut Mountain and west of
                                    that place. fighting evidently in progress on the extreme right….The
                                    Steamer "Paint Rock" ran the blockade, passed down the river to
                                    Bridgeport, after night, for the purpose of transporting supplies to the army. Rebel
                                    sharp shooters fired into them as they passed down doing little injury. Have bright
                                    hopes now of be [ing] supplied bountifuly at this place Communication now being open
                                    by river and by rail, soon as the road can be repaired, to within a few miles of 
                                        Chattanooga
                                    .
                        October 30, Friday…..Cannonading all day at intervals….
                        October 31, Saturday….very busy all day, preparing to muster; preparing
                                    monthly and Ration Returns. Firing at intervals, from Lookout Mountain, doing little
                                    or no injury.
                        November 1, 1863, Sabbath…..Very little Cannonading to day Rations short,
                                    but prospects good for something better, as the Tenn. river has been opened to
                                    within a few miles of 
                                        Chattanooga
                                    , and a couple of Steamers are plying between Bridgeport and that point,
                                    by which we expect plenty of all that pertains to soldier life. Rev. Charlott
                                    addressed a small audience to day: this is the first sermon I have heard for severel

                                    Nov 1st 1863.
                                
                        ….Lieut Marshall has been detailed as "Quarter Master"
                                    of the Regiment for what length of time I know not, consequently I have taken
                                    command of the Company to day: and will necessarily have a great deal to do now:
                                    more than every before. I will now have to do a great deal of
                                    writing,—Making out "Monthly Returns," "Ration
                                    Returns," "Ordnance Reports" Muster and Pay Rolls, and
                                    doing many other kinds of company business….We are having very pleasant
                                    time here considering, what might be expected under the circumstances. Rations have
                                    been short since we came here, but the Tennessee river having
                                    been opened to within 5 or 6 miles of 
                                        Chattanooga
                                    , and having two Steamers to ply between Brideport and that point, makes
                                    the prospect very fair for better times, in the "grub" and
                                    clothing line.
                        The Rail Road is also open to within two or three miles of  this place but not repaired yet. The prospect for
                                    better times are very flattering. Have plenty of duty to do—on
                                    "picket" once every third day and "fatigue duty"
                                    the remainder of the time. But where this is realy necessary, as it has been here,
                                    it is considered no hardship. The rebel pickets stand within two hundred yards of
                                    ours, neither one firing, without some demonstrations on the part of the other are
                                    made. There has been, during the last week, some very warm fighting, down the river,
                                    caused by the advance of Hookers command, they succeeded well, but lost a number of
                                    men about 200. The cannons are roaring again to day as usual:—create no
                                    uneasyness whatever with us, we being so used to them. There has been no fighting in
                                    our immediate front for near three weeks. I can see the rebel camps very plain while
                                    siting in my "Hut" which by the way is a very
                                    "fine" little establishment composed principaly of Board with a
                                    Shingle roof, and a Brick chimney attached, which adds to comfort a great deal,
                                    especialy of cold rainy days….
                     
                  
               
                
            
                    
                  
                     
                        November 2, Monday. During last night and this morning the rebels approached near to
                                    our lines and attempted to throw up earthworks, our batteries opened upon them near
                                    twelve o'clock. a battery within a few yards of our camp fired quite number
                                    of rounds during the day disturbing the rebels to a great degree. No reply from
                                    them. They fired a number of shots from the summit of Lookout Mountain in various
                                    directions, some at our picket detail as they went out this morning, doing no injury
                                    so far as I can learn….Mail arrives pretty regular again. About 8
                                    o'clock at night the Brigade was called out in line, and formed in the
                                    breastworks, (the diches of which were partialy filled with mud and water) as though
                                    an attack was expected, the rebels having been unusualy bold in their demonstrations
                                    during last night and to day. After standing in line until about half past 9
                                    o'clock were dismissed, and returned to quarters, about 100 yards distant.
                                    Quite a large detail was sent out to the front, near the picket line, to fortify
                                    (under cover of the night,) a position in which to use artillery, should the rebels
                                    persist in their attempt to fortify so near our lines.
                        November 3, Tuesday…..Detailed and reported for "pickt
                                    guard", at 6 1/2 A. M. Passed the regular routine of "Guard
                                    Mount"—Inspection and Review" in the meantime the
                                    "Brass Band" was discoursing music for us. The picket detail from
                                    the Brigade numbered about 300 men. About 11 A. M. the battery in Ft Negley opened
                                    on the rebels who were attempting to work The shells bursted so near to them as to
                                    cause them to break and run in wild confusion across the field like so many wild
                                    turkeys, with their heads tucked down. Some of them were known to be hurt. Shelling
                                    continued all day at intervals from Lookout Mountain, also our Batteries kept up a
                                    pretty brisk fire from Mockison Point, which is a hight point on an Island about one
                                    mile below 
                                        Chattanooga
                                    , and almost opposite to Lookout Mountain. But few shots fired at night,
                                    all quiet on the lines, rebels very close by.
                        November 4, Wednesday….Relieved from picket at 8 A. M. A few artillery
                                    shots fired near noon continuing during the day at intervals….In the
                                    after noon the detail of 11 men from Co "I",  112 from regiment, returned from Stevenson Ala. having
                                    been gone since the 15 of October, guarding a supply train. was happy to see them
                                    return home, after being absent so long a time. they were greeted by us, as the[y]
                                    would by their friends, should they be permitted to return home. Soldiers of a
                                    company, or regiment become attached to each other to such a degree as to cause them
                                    to act, (when meeting a companion of long absence,) as though he were a brother
                        November 5, Thursday…..Unusualy quiet to day. comparatively few cannon
                                    shots fired during the day.
                        November 6, Friday. Cannonading begins pretty early, principaly west of Lookout
                                    Mountain, all quiet in front….
                        November 7, Saturday. Quite an unusual amount of artillery firing to day, from the
                                    point of Lookout, and from Mockison point….Rations are a little more
                                    plenty, with better prospect ahead.
                        November 8, Sabbath. Slightly clouded today with a piercing wind astir, dashing the
                                    smoke to and fro, and entering every slight opening, in my Cottage, which by the way
                                    arc not so scarce. "Shelling" is the order of the day. none
                                    interfere with us. No indications of a collision between the contending armies. Two

                        ….News has come, almost to a stand point: and nothing is being done, save
                                    the regular routine of daily duties, which, by the way: includes cannonading. The
                                    rebels have a battery on the point of Lookout Mountain near 2400 feet above us and
                                    about 2 miles distant, from which they exert themselves to the utmost to injure us.
                                    The shells from that point burst high in the air doing no injury whatever
                        Our Batteries on Fort Negley near by us have been annoying the rebels a great deal
                                    this past week, while they were attempting to approach our lines with new
                                    fortifications they were in plain view of the picket line, and we could see the
                                    result of every Shot. One shell burst in a stack of guns, scattering them high in
                                    the air. I could see the men runing to the timber with all possible speed. Two
                                    deserters came in to that Station last night, and report that, at the bursting of
                                    that one shell, there was one Lieut killed and five men wounded. they then suspended
                                    operations until a more convenient season, and that season does not come often.
                        Supplies are coming in very fast by way of the 
                                        Tennessee
                                     rive to whithin eight miles of

                                     and from that point are easily hauled. The Catholic Church Bell is now
                                    ringing in town. it sounds very much like the Church Bell at 
                                        Franklin
                                     and reminds of the many pleasant hours I have passed, inside of that
                                    Institution. How different my situation now, but I enjoy myself very well. have good

                                    1862. have no reason for complaint. I enlisted to fight rebels, and expect to do so
                                    long as…they hold out, if I am spared so long as that….
                        Artillery practice has been a little more brisk to day than usual. it signifies
                                    nothing….
                        Jessee Mayfield is here in my "house." he was sick about two weeks
                                    ago, but has recovered, so as to have good health again. My health is is very
                                    good….

                                    "Dress parade" at 4, P. M. wind blowing so severely as to make it
                                    difficult to stand in line.
                        November 10, Tuesday. Morning cold and frosty ground frozen, ice on standing water. I
                                    was detailed to work on one of the Forts, wind blew cool all day, labor was
                                    necessary to prevent suffering with cold yet on half rations. Very few shots fired
                                    to day—unusualy quiet—the rebels are geting tired of waisting
                                    amunition from the crest of Lookout Mountain.
                        November 11, Wednesday…..Very little cannonading until near night, when it
                                    was pretty brisk for hall an hour….
                        November 12, Thursday….there was some artillery practice in the direction
                                    of Lookout….
                        November 13, Friday….the brigade was called out to witness the execution
                                    of two "Deserters", one Benjamin of the 44 Ill. and one Daly of
                                    the 88th Ill. The brigade was formed in a hollow square in two lines, between which
                                    the procession marched: the convicts marching after their Coffins, the Brass Band
                                    playing a plaintive tune—all performed in solemn style. A file of men
                                    were drawn up in line, twelve in number, half of the peices charged with Blank
                                    cartridges. After the Parsons had waited upon them, they were seated upon their
                                    Coffins eyes blinded: the troops kneeled at which instant the guns fired, the men
                                    falling back, dying without a groan. It looked hard that men should thus be treated,
                                    but it cannot be doubted that they got their dues. The heavy fog and smoke prevented
                                    the rebels from shelling us, as they attemped, with marked effect. It was extremely
                                    warm about noon, at the time of the execution. But few shots fired during the day.
                                    Dress Parade every afternoon at 4, P. M.
                        November 14. Saturday…..Lieut Marshall received detail to go to Indiana on
                                    "Recruiting Service" also Adjutant Adams Lieut West-over, and
                                    Seven Segts from the regiment. Cannonading in the vicinity of Lookout Mountain
                                    continued during the day.
                        November 15, Sabbath…..The day was occupied in receiving pay, for four
                                    months, ending 31st of October. At 7 o'clock A. M. Lieut Marshall began his
                                    journey northward. Some very brisk artillery firing in the afternoon, as usual doing
                                    no injury so far as heard from. Thus a Sabbath day was spent, receiving money and
                                    setling account; how long must this continue! not even the wisest of the nation can
                                    tell!
                        November 16, Monday….little of note occured, save the usual routine of
                                    camp duties, and cannonading.

                        ….Deserters from the rebel army succeed in reaching our lines amost every
                                    night, and a goodly number of them are Commissioned Officers. they run narrow risks
                                    in the attempt, are always fired upon by their own men and often by ours, mistaking
                                    the object of their approach. They report that there are many regiments, from which
                                    every man would willingly desert if there was an opportunity, but that they have
                                    three lines of sentinels in order to prevent this. The deserters report the rebels
                                    suffering for many articles which are necessary for the comfort of men. amongst
                                    other things they are very scarce of Pork, and Sugar and Coffee they have not.  If our soldiers happen to get without these

                        17th This morning early the artillery broke out in good style up the river. the
                                    firing was terrific in the extreme for half an hour, then ceased and all is quiet in
                                    that direction I do not know either the cause of the firing or the result. But
                                    suppose that it was our forces attempting to lay a "Pontoon
                                    Bridge" across the river

                        November 17, Tuesday. At the dawn of day, artillery "opened" on the
                                    left, in the vicinity of the river, continuing for about half an hour, in good
                                    order—terrific. it is reported that but one man on our side was hurt. It
                                    is said to have been brought about by an attempt on our part to span the river, with
                                    a pontoon bridge, with which they have been successful. If such be the case stiring
                                    news may be expected soon from this quarter of the Globe. May the good work continue
                                    to prosper and meet with success….Slight firing from Lookout Mountain.
                                    Also a number of shots fired from Mockison Point.
                        November 18, Wednesday. I was detailed at 6% A. M. for fatigue duty, with 150 men, to
                                    work on Forts….About noon there were a few heavy volleys of musketry
                                    fired in the direction of Lookout mountain near the base, result unknown. Rev N. P.
                                    Charlott, (Chaplain of the regiment) started early this morning to Ind on business
                                    for the regiment.
                        November 19, Thursday….but one or two shots fired from Lookout Mountain to
                                    day, rather singular for it has been their practice to keep up a continuous firing
                                    all day….Dress parade at 4 P. M.
                        November 20, Friday. The 22nd Ind. detailed for picket at 7 1/2 a.
                                    m….About noon our artillery began shelling the rebels about t,he base of
                                    Lookout Mont The shots were well directed, as we could see the shells explode over
                                    the rebel works. The rebels did not reply. At noon received orders to have 80 rounds
                                    of cartridges, to the man, and two days cooked rations in haversacks by the
                                    following morning shortly after night were relieved from picket to make ready for
                                    the contemplated move, which was done, but at 9 o'clock the order was
                                    countermanded. we then retired quietly to rest.
                        November 21, Saturday…..Severel shots fired from Moccasin point to day but
                                    none from Lookout Mountain.
                        November 22, Sabbath. I with a detail of one hundred men, was sent out on
                                    picket….Early in the morning it was discovered that the rebels were
                                    moving heavy trains and troops eastward, over Mission Ridge, the summit of which is
                                    about three miles distant from our camp. There are five roads in view over which
                                    they passed. In the fore noon our heavy batteries, in "Ft Wood"
                                    opened upon them,  which first produced a
                                    defiant "yell," and finaly changing into fear and confusion. Our
                                    shelis were well directed, continuing during the entire day. The rebels were
                                    doubtless very much annoyed. There were a few shots fired from a small gun on
                                    Lookout Mountain, doing no injury whatever. no others were fired on the rebels side.
                                    Shortly after night we were relieved from picket, having received marching orders
                                    with two days rations and eighty rounds of cartridges The "11th Army
                                    Corps" came in to night. Shermans Corps has passed up the north bank of the
                                    river….
                        November 23, Monday…..At 1 o'clock P. M. were called into line,
                                    and immediately formed a line of battle about 600 yards outside of the works, in an
                                    open field. the lines being formed, the left (Woods Division), pressed forward
                                    fighting their way, and advanced about 1 1/2 miles, securing a very strong position
                                    without much loss: in the mean time we advanced with little resistance. by night the
                                    new line was established and was hastily being fortified There was some nice
                                    artillery practice from our Forts in the afternoon. 10 o'clock at night a
                                    few shots were fired in our front, immediately all were to arms….
                        November 24, Tuesday. Morning frosty. Were aroused at 2 A. M. and moved farther to
                                    the left. At 10, A. M. the battle opened furiously near the western base of Lookout
                                    Mountain Our heavy guns on Moccasin point were speedily worked, and about 2, P. M.
                                    had the pleasure of seeing our forces coming around the point on the bench of
                                    "Lookout." The rebels were immediately charged out of their works
                                    on the east side of the mountain. Fighting continued heavy until about 10
                                    o'clock P. M. when all again became quiet. While this was being done,
                                    Sherman was crossing his forces near the mouth of Chickamauga which was done without
                                    resistance, on the part of the rebels. The loss has been light so far.
                        November 25, Wednesday. Heavy fighting on the extreme left early this morning, about
                                    noon our position was changed to the right. it was evident to my mind that there was
                                    something contemplated, from the disposition of the troops—as they were
                                    being massed about 2 miles from the summit of Missionary Ridge, in the timber. At 2,
                                    P. M. the signal shots were fired and the column, which was 5 or 6 miles in length;
                                    advanced together. The ascent of the ridge was very steep and about 1/2 mile high,
                                    with one line of rifle pits at the base, another, one third of the distance up,
                                    while the crest was lined with troops and heavy artillery, from which the advancing
                                    column, (three deep) were subjected to a raking fire, of shot Shell and canister.
                                    When within a mile of the first line of rebel works, the different columns started
                                    on the "double quick" which soon increased to the
                                    "run" immediately the rebel batteries opened, with telling effect,
                                    and would have done much injury had not been for our swift movements. The three
                                    lines rushed together into the rebel works, after having crossed the open field in
                                    very good order. The colum immediately pressed forward up the hill to the 2d Line of
                                    works, which were soon occupied, and again we pressed forward, for the crest, losing
                                    no time. Near this place seven of Co "I" were wounded being
                                    subjected to a heavy cross fire, from enemies artillery. I received a wound in the
                                    right arm when within on[e] hundred yards  of
                                    the crest of the hill The wounded were 1st Segt William B Miller, severely in right
                                    shoulder, Segt Moses St. Clair, severly in right side, Corpl Benj T Gardner,
                                    severely, shot through left leg, Privates Joseph H. Cooper, flesh wound in right
                                    thigh, John T. Eller, severly Shot through the face, John Mc 
                                        Pike
                                    , wounded in shoulder, thigh and hand—concussion of shell,
                                    William Southern. severly in left eye. Company "I" numbered forty
                                    all told, Eight of whom were wounded. The 22nd lost but three killed and 32 wounded
                                    in the engagement, thus showing that my company lost near one fourth. The crest of
                                    the hill was gained at 4 1/2, P. M. Regiments were soon formed to repel an assault
                                    if one should be made by the rebels but their retreat was hasty and confused, with a
                                    loss of many—prisoners, and much artillery. Here we halted to replenish
                                    our stock of ammunition, which was greatly depleted, and also the
                                    "grub." before this was done orders were received to march in
                                    pursuit of the retreating enemy, followed to Chickamauga creek about 5 miles
                                    distant, and halted to await the arrival of "day
                                    light"….
                        November 26, Thursday. Marched up near the old Bridge, which had been partialy
                                    destroyed by the rebels, and where a temperary crossing was being constructed, and
                                    which was well nigh completed when Sheridans Division received orders to return to 
                                        Chattanooga
                                    , (being relieved by Gen Bairds Div. of the 14 Army Corps,) arriving at
                                    our camp near night after having traveled about 8 miles, very steady march, and
                                    being very sore, since yesterdays, "Charge." Found the camp to be
                                    a pleasant resort. Good warm fire, and comfortable bed. At 9 o'clock P. M.
                                    received orders to be ready to march at 7 A. M. the following morning, which order
                                    was soon countermanded, until further orders. It was then a settled fact that there
                                    was no rest for us yet, we must march soon.
                        November 27, Friday. Morning dawned beautiful and quiet. The entire day passed off
                                    without even a rumor to mar the peace of wearied soldiers. My arm swelled very large
                                    from shoulder to hand settled Slack with bruised blood. Can not use it, have not
                                    been off duty yet. At night received orders to be ready to march at 7 A. M.
                                    tomorrow.
                        November 28, Saturday. Morning cloudy and raining. Troops did not march until near
                                    noon, when it ceased to rain. The weather being very disagreeable, and my arm yet
                                    being very sore and painful, the Surgeon advised me to remain in camp, which was
                                    reluctantly done, it being the first time that…I have been off duty for
                                    more than a year. The company started in charg of Segt Coffey.6
                                    Very lonely times in camp….
                        November 29, Sabbath. Very stormy and cold. The day was occupied in searching for the
                                    wounded in hospitals. These were so scattered as to render it very difficult to find
                                    them.
                        November 30, Monday. I visited my old friends in the 59th Ind belonging to Shermans
                                    command on the north side of the river. Enjoyed 
                              
                                 6 The Twenty-Second Indiana was among the troops sent
                                            to aid General A. E. Burnside at 
                                                Knoxville
                                            , where he was being attacked by Confederate troops under
                                            General James Longstreet.
                           
                                     the trip very much….suffered
                                    severely with my wound after returning
                        December 1, 1863, Tuesday…..Capt Moss and I took a pleasure excursion over
                                    the rebel camps and fortifications, and also over Misaionary Ridge. Found their
                                    camps to have been on low, wet, ground and very filthy; their works were very small,
                                    and a direct line, without an angle: with which to give an infilading fire. Showing
                                    a great lack of skill in engineering, or a degree of carelessness, which causes a
                                    failure in everything attempted. Missionary Ridge we found to be very steep, and
                                    rough, and the timber well marked with the deadly missiles, especialy the rebel
                                    works on the crest of the hill were well battered. Benj. T. Gardner, Co
                                    "I" died at General Hospital no. "4", of
                                    wound—gun shot through left leg—received 25 of Nov 1863, in
                                    the assault of Missionary Ridge.
                        December 2, Wednesday…..Very little of importance afloat.
                        A very nice hull of a new steamer, which was captured from the rebels, came down the
                                    river to day, it will soon be put in running order.
                        December 3, Thursday…..At 11 A. M. crossed 
                                        Chattanooga
                                     creek, which is a very deep stream with high banks, emptying into the
                                    Tenn. river at the base of Lookout Mountain, at which place the R. R. leading; from 
                                        Chattanooga
                                     to Bridgport crosses. At this point we, (Capt Moss and I) began to
                                    ascend the mountain which was very steep and rough, viewed the rifle pits and breast
                                    works, which the rebels had constructed during their occupation of the Mountain.
                                    Their defenses were good, beside the natural position of the country, which was
                                    decidedly in their favor. There are several roads runing around the point of the
                                    mountain none of which are very good. About 2/3 of the way up is a spot of cleared
                                    land, 40 or 50 acres,—one vast orchard of Fruit trees, and on which is
                                    situated, (the ground having been leveled down for that purpose,) a very nice
                                    residence, which bears the emblem of war, havir,g had five or six cannon shots to
                                    pass through it, thrown from our batteries on Moccasin Piont, situated on the north
                                    side, and in a bend of the river opposite to Lookout. This point is so named from
                                    its peculiar shape,—being that of a Moccasin complete. We ploded our way
                                    up the steep ascent and when within 100 feet of the crest, were compelled to climb
                                    ladders a portion of that distance. Reaching the top at 1 o'clock P. M.
                                    having been two hours on the way. The stone cliffs on the point are about 100 feet
                                    high, and the tops appear to project far out over the base. they are well marked
                                    with shots from our artillery. From this point 
                                        Chattanooga
                                     with all its surroundings are distinctly visible. Our large forts
                                    situated on high commanding positions appear to be on a common level with other
                                    objects, and even Missionary Ridge loses its lofty appearance, when viewed from this
                                    point. The rebels had prepared themselves very well, having fortified every pass to
                                    the mountain, but so hasty was their retreat, that they left their tents, cooking
                                    utensils, and even the Officers many of their trunks. About one mile back, on the
                                    crest which is tolerably level and nice, is Summerville, a small village, noted as a
                                    pleasant summer retreat, and containing for the most part houses of entertainment,
                                    and preparation. for all kinds of amusement, has one very large nice Hotel.  After being satisfied with viewing the
                                    beauties, we decended on steps prepared for the purpose viewing the rebel earthworks
                                    as we returned, arriving at camp near night, wearied and suffering severely with my
                                    wound, the fatigue being to great.
                        December 4, Friday…..I, again searched diligently for Segt Miller, finding
                                    him in Johnson's Hospital. His wound is dangerous, he is suffering
                                    severely….
                        December 6, Sabbath…..At noon, accepted an invitation to dine with Capt.
                                    Moss,—given as a "Birth day" repast. Had a bountiful
                                    supply of the fat of the land—Fowls, Potatoes, and many other eatables,
                                    rare to the soldier….
                        December 7, Monday…..Rev. Charlott returned Little of importance
                                    occured….
                        December 9, Wednesday…..My time occupied in a great degree, visiting 1st
                                    Segt William B. Miller, who was dangerously wounded, Nov 25, 1863, and whose
                                    recovery: can not be. Suffers severly, must die soon. Is, no doubt, prepared to meet
                                    his God!
                        December 10, Thursday…..Visited Segt Miller often during the day, saw that
                                    he must die, suffered much, breathed very hard. At 3 o'clock, P. M. his
                                    spirit took its flight, leaving the lifeless form of him, who was so highly
                                    respected—so dearly loved.
                        December 11, Friday. Segt Millers remains intered, by his friends, and Rev Charlott,
                                    who were in attendance, in a solemn and respectful manner, due the life he lived.

                                    of winter clothing arriving.
                        December 12, Saturday…..Near noon a salute of (34 guns (20 pdr Parrots)
                                    were fired at Ft Wood, cause unknown, to me. I suppose it to be in honor of the
                                    permanent occupation of East 
                                        Tennessee

                                    that it was joy over the capture of Longstreet and a part of his
                                    command….
                        December 13, Sabbath. Raining all day, dreary and lonesome, beyond discription while

                        …when I last wrote, my arm was paining me to much for me to realize what
                                    was written. It is now almost well, but not very stout yet. My health is very good,
                                    never was better. I have not heard from the regiment, since they left on the 28th of
                                    Nov. more than that they were at 
                                        Knoxville
                                     Tenn. and were expected to return soon. The relief sent from
                                    here,—under Sherman—to Burnside caused Longstreet to raise the
                                    seige of 
                                        Knoxville
                                     on quick time, if not quicker. I would like to be with the company
                                    since I am able to travel. I love to travel in a mountainous country where I can get
                                    items, to fill in my journal. beside it would be pleasant to travel through a loyal
                                    country as East 
                                        Tenn 
                                    claims to be, and no doubt it is in a great degree loyal.
                        ….I have just returned from the burial of 1st Segt William. B. Miller who
                                    died yesterday, of wounds received Nov 25 in the assault on Missionary Ridge. two of
                                    the best soldiers in the company have died, since that terrible conflict.
                        All others of the company who were wounded are doing well. J. T. Eller has gone

                        ….I had not been absent from my company a single day for more than two
                                    years, until the 28 of Nov. when the regiment started to 
                                        Knoxville
                                     Tenn. I was somewhat vexed to think that a slight wound which would be
                                    well in a few weeks,—and which would not keep me from doing duty if they
                                    were to remain in camp,—should separate me from the company—my
                                    companions in arms. To be submissive and cheerful was all that could consistently be
                                    done.
                        The company numbers, 49 enlisted men, 35 of whom are present (with the regiment) for
                                    duty. Five of the remainder are on Detached duty, and Nine are in Hospitals. Six of
                                    whom are wounded. There were but three in Hospitals before the battle. The Captain,
                                    (A. R. Ravenscroft) is on detached service—in Ordnance Department, has
                                    been absent for more than a year. Lieut Marshall, is now at home on Recruiting
                                    service. I have not heard yet how he is succeeding, but he wrote to me that he was
                                    having to recruit in 
                                        Brown
                                    , Co. which I am confident is a hopeless case. I suppose that recruiting
                                    will not he wry fast at best.
                        I wish to know if you have an idea of enlisting. soon as you answer this I will write
                                    some particulars in the case. I have great fears of your ability to stand the
                                    service, as you failed in the first attempt. And where a family furnishes two
                                    soldiers, to the army, the third one should have the privilege of attaining an
                                    education. Rut after all the maintainance of the Nation is above all such pursuits.
                                    I continue to think as before that the rebellion will not last long. It is my desire
                                    that you remain at College and whenever your means are runing short, so as to
                                    interfere with your studies, let me know it, 2nd if it is possible (it is not often
                                    impossible) I will assist you cheerfuly—with all my heart.
                        You have perhapse e're this, received $20.00 I sent by express,
                                    if so you will use it, taking no thought of my need, for I always retain plenty for
                                    my own use. neither do I wish you to uneasy your mind about how you are to pay this
                                    in future. It is a gift, a free one too; and I ask no pay; more than that you apply
                                    it to secure an education for yourself, and when it is thus applied I will be
                                    paid,—bountifuly paid.
                        My health continues good. wound is almost well, but is not improving much now. I have
                                    pretty good use of my arm, can write without any serious pain. Rut I can not do
                                    much, (not even brush my clothes) without enterfering with a tender part.
                        In the late battle C. H. Coffey, as usual, got a message from rebeldom which relieved
                                    him of his canteen, penetrated his haversack and clothing and continued on its
                                    journey, harmless. He thought that it struck in a very tender place, cuting off his
                                    suply of water and interfering with the "grub sack." His health
                                    was good when they left here more than two weeks since….

                        Chattanooga

                    advance began on May 6, the regiment left camp; and from this point the diary gives an eloquent
                    account of the campaign that must have seemed almost a continuous battle. Something of
                    Sherman's method of out. flanking his opponent is evident in Mayfield's
                    descriptions. Unfortunately for this record, the departure from this procedure in the attack at
                        Kenesaw Mountain, with its heavy casualties, resulted in the wounding of
                    Lieutenant Mayfield and the end of his diary. His brother, Joseph M. Mayfield to whom the letters
                    were written, had enlisted in Company I of the Twenty-Second and was killed in action in 1864; so
                    there are no more letters to give us a record of the remainder of the campaign. The Twenty-Second,
                    however, went on with Sherman to Savannah, 
                        Georgia
                    , and, when the war ended, to 
                        Washington, D. C.
                    , and thence to 
                        Indianapolis
                    , where it was disbanded.
            The portion of the campaign covered by Mayfield's diary may be checked with the official
                    report of Major General William T. Sherman, in Official Records, Series I. Vol.
                    XXXVIII, Part 1, pp. 61–85, and with the report of Major General George H. Thomas, ibid., 139–45.

                                    skirmishing kept up all day along the hill side and in front of the gape. at times
                                    the skirmishing increased almost to a full grown battle. very little gained during

                                    behind a hill, the rebel "Sharpshooters" having become so annoying
                                    as to render our old position very unpleasant….At 1 P.M. received orders
                                    to march to the front for skirmishers. immediately the brigade was ready, when the

                                    time—the third charming—we marched to the front, wending our

                                    arose from beds of mud and water—made so by the storm—and
                                    hastened to the top of the ridge, behind which we were posted—one hundred
                                    yards distant—and formed a line of battle to await the issue of events.

                                    and sacked the night before the rebels left—by themselves. Many citizens

                                    formed in second line of battle, from which place the regiment was soon moved to the
                                    front and deployed as skirmishers, moving forward for one mile, when at 10, a.m.

                                    headlong onto the weak line of skirmishers, driving us for a short distance where
                                    they were checked by our fire. There were many incident of interest occured in those

                                    South-west. At 10, P. M the rebels assaulted the line on cur left, but were repulsed
                                    after an hours fighting, some artillery used. Immediately an assault was made to our
                                    right—in front of the 16th corps,—fighting
                                    terrific,—cannonading heavy. several assaults were made on our lines; all
                                    of which were repulsed without serious loss to us. We were up almost all night, have
                                    had very little rest for four nights—being on the front line all the
                                    time.
                        May 30, Monday…..the regular routine of skirmishing soon
                                    began….Little of importance occured until near night the rebels could be
                                    seen moving to our left, along the high ridge which they occupied in front of us Our
                                    line of works were changed and strengthened some what—to suit the case
                                    pending. Soon after dark the Brigade was withdrawn from its advanced position near
                                    one mile—and form[ed] on a line with the skirmish line with a small
                                    support being left behing. Marched very slow, at 10, P. M had formed on the 2nd line
                                    of battle. Considerable firing on the right. Tuesday May 31st, Lying

                                    securing ourselves behind a hill until 10, A. M. The whole right, (consisting of the
                                    15th, 16th, and a portion of the 14 corps,) are being withdrawn, and moved to our
                                    left, the rebels having moved their main force from our front. At 10 A. M. marched
                                    off very slow, and in a direction parallel with our lines. halted at noon, having
                                    marched 2 miles Marched again at 4 P. M. a distance of four miles, taking position
                                    at 9 o'clock, P. M. on the skirmish line. Considerable firing on our right.
                                    were aroused at midnight with the firing on the right.
                        June 2, Thursday…..Our men kept up a brisk fire from the
                                    works,—composed of logs and dirt—behind which we were posted.
                                    Rebels fired many shots doing little injury—over shot….No
                                    heavy fighting within our hearing today,—time occupied in manouvering  troops. Were relieved from picket at night, and
                                    returned to second line of works, 500 yards in rear of front The rebel defenses are
                                    well constructed, and very near to our front line.
                        June 3, Friday. Were aroused after midnight by a heavy skirmish on the
                                    right….Cannonading both on the right and left.
                        June 4, Saturday…..At 7, A. M. received orders to prepare to march
                                    immediately, which we did, moving off in the direction of our left, roads very mudy,
                                    and slippery. marched near 2 miles and the brigade immediately moved to the front
                                    line, where heavy skirmishing was in progress, also artillery was being used, (7th

                                    the rebel skirmishers. secured our selves behind trees and stumps. The firing at
                                    night was very heavy and continuous lasting all night, with terrible fury. Rained
                                    very hard at night, slept almost none. At midnight the rebels had very large camp
                                    fires—soon after their bugles were sounded, and we suspicioned that
                                    something was being done. Marched 2 miles
                        June 5, Sabbath…..Skirmishing continued very brisk until 8 A. M. when we
                                    advanced a little and by 10, A. M. it was discovered that the rebels were gone. Our
                                    skirmishers advanced severel miles in pursuit. At 4 P. M. fighting was heard in the
                                    direction of 
                                        Marietta

                                    M. and returned to camp to get one nights rest. The Brigade having been on the front
                                    line for 12 days in sucession, very little rest to be had during that time, are very

                                    but a small portion of it has passed. had the pleasure of meeting with many old
                                    friends from various regiments.
                        June 8, Wednesday. Yet in camp nothing to do. weather almost to hot to live. Rained

                        June 10, Friday. Marched at 7 A. M. in a southwesterly direction,—cuting a
                                    road through a densely thick wooded country, the roads being occupied by troops of
                                    other corps…we marched slowly but steadily on, taking a position in front
                                    of and near to the rebel lines—where they could be seen at work
                                    appearantly fortifying a hill in our front. skirmishing, together with some
                                    artillery firing was the order of the evening. remained here at
                                    night….marched 4 miles
                        June 11, Saturday. Orders at an early hour to be ready to march at a moments
                                    warning….at 10 a. m. marched in an easterly direction, 2 miles through a
                                    rough country swampy and covered with undre-brush. Davis Division now filling a gap
                                    on the right of the 15th Corps….At 4 P. M. again received orders to march
                                    at a moments At 6 moved in an easterly direction, one mile, halting at the railroad
                                    immediately in front of the foe skirmishing is the order of  the day. soon pitched our tents for a small barrier
                                    against the heavy rain storm which followed. marched 3 miles
                        June 12th, Sabbath…..skirmishing on our front all day. Occasioqal
                                    artillery firing on different portions of the line….Our lines are now
                                    formed—runing east and west—we on the right of, and at the
                                    Rail Road, facing southward. In front one mile are the rebels backed by a high
                                    ridge, through a gap of which the rail-road passes. The country at this point is
                                    more open and level. Yesterday our ears were greeted with the whistle of Engines
                                    (glad tidings) approaching very near to our rear. Today the whistle both north and
                                    south of us can be heard very distinctly.
                        June 13, Monday…..The regular routine of skirmishing as usual in progress,
                                    with occasional cannon shots on left. At 10, A. M. received orders to be ready to
                                    march at a moments warning….At 5 P. M. Davis Division advanced its lines
                                    1/2 mile. McCooks Brig. moving to the right, of 2nd, our advance was not opposed by
                                    the rebels. Our lines were form in a very thick wooded broken scope of country,
                                    immediately fortified with logs, rails and dirt. then rested quietly at night.
                                    Extreme right of our lines advanced to day, result unknown.
                        June 14, Tuesday. Little of importance occured during the day beyond the usual
                                    routine of picket and artillery firing.
                        June 15, Wednesday…..At noon our troops more than a mile to the left
                                    advance across an open field and drive the rebels from their work and occupy. Later
                                    in the day the 16th Corps advances, drives the rebel skirmishers and takes
                                    possession of their outer works, fighting heavy and continuous. Artillery used
                                    extensively both here and on the extreme right. Were aroused at midnight by heavy
                                    skirmishing, indicating an attack—on the left of our front.
                        June 16, Thursday…..yet Lying in breastworks. At noon a detail for
                                    skirmishers, of 6 Co's including Co "I" from the 22nd
                                    Ind. was made. The skirmish line was half mile in front, the land being so thickly
                                    covered with wood and underbrush as to render it almost impassable. Deployed and
                                    took position on the line under a rapid fire from the reb guns. Skirmishing quite
                                    brisk along the entire line, more especialy on the left in front of the 16th corps.
                                    Heavy fighting on the right. Late in the afternoon got in to a conversation with the
                                    rebels in cur front,—44th Miss Sharpshooters,—in which there
                                    was a propposition to cease firing concented to-very quiet afterward. It was
                                    expected that this portion of the line was to be "charged" in the
                                    afternoon or night, and preparations were made accordingly. From 9 to 10 P. M.
                                    scarcely a shot was to be heard on the line. It was so uncommon as to
                                        attract the attention of the entire army, and was considered indicative of
                                    a storm. in the mean time we could hear the rebel artillery
                                    moving—shifting position—while at another place they were at
                                    worship—singing and could be heard very distinctly. at 11
                                    o'clock a weak charge was made on the left which brought us to our posts
                                    very hastily. the usual skirmishing continued. Two of 22nd, one of Co.
                                    "I" and one of Co. B. were wounded.
                        June 17, Friday…..The usual amount of firing on the left and some severe
                                    fighting on the right.. quiet in our front, men, by mutual agreement, meet midway
                                    between the lines, and converse. Heavy  fighting
                                    on right in vicinity of 4th and 20th corps. they are supposed to be closing upon the
                                    rebels. Relieved at 1 P. M. and returned to breast-works. At 4 P. M. An assault, was
                                    made on the rebel works on left, the outer line of which was taken and occupied.
                                    skirmishers in our front advance 1/4 mile with little opposition. Capture some
                                    prisoners. Artillery firing on the right continues brisk. Not a great deal of firing
                                    at night.
                        June 18, Saturday…..Connaiding continues very heavy on the extreme right.
                                    At noon have orders to be ready to march at a moments
                                    warning….Skirmishing begins again with renewed vigor at 2, P. M. At 5 P.
                                    M. moved out 1/2 mile and fortified anew our position….
                        June 19, Sabbath…..in early morning it was discovered the rebels were
                                    giving back from their position in our front. our skirmishers pursued them close. At
                                    8 a.m. marched out of the works a short distance and halted unto 4 P.
                                    M.—awaiting a clear road—when we marched on through rain, mud
                                    and water, to within one mile of Kinesaw Ridge. formed in reserve. by this the
                                    batteries were making fine music, together with the musketry. One of our Trains ran
                                    down near the foot of the mountain. The rebels threw a few shots from the ridge, at
                                    it, did no injury….marched one mile
                        June 20, Monday…..Our cannon shots well directed at the mountain ridge
                                    skirmishing very brisk. At 5 P. M. received orders to march. moved by the right
                                    flank near a mile, and formed on the front line. The army shifting to the right.
                                    From 6 to 7 1/2 P. M. the Artillery for near 3 miles along the line, poured forth
                                    volley after volley of shot and shell, whole batteries firing at the same instant.
                                    It was the most terrific that I ever witnessed Prom one side alone. The smoke soon
                                    became very thick. In the mean time heavy musketry was heard on the right. a charge
                                    was made but by whom, and the result is unknown. From camp rumors it would appear
                                    that desertions from the rebel army continue numerous. Fortified our position which
                                    took to midnight….Times very exciting. Marched one mile
                        June 21, Tuesday…..Artillery and musketry very brisk from 10, A. M. to
                                    near noon, when musketry subcided in a great degree Shot and Shell continued to fly
                                    at Kenesaw Ridge all day. In afternoon there was appearantly heavy fighting on the
                                    extreme right,—result unknown.
                        June 22, Wednesday…..At 8 a.m. the rebels, on Kenesaw Ridge in our
                                    immediate front, opened on our works with several batteries. The firing was very
                                    rapid and exciting. Shells flew thick over heads bursting in the woods behind. Some
                                    droped among our tents, others bursted high in air. This state of affairs continued
                                    near all day Our batteries, except those far to the right, did not reply, the time
                                    being occupied in preparing works. We were annoyed considerably by stray minie
                                    balls, str[ag]gling through our home. At night cannon ceased firing, skirmishing
                                    more brisk. At 9 P. M. marched to the right, and at 1 A. M. returned to our own
                                    works. Immediately after halting rebel shells were droped thick and fast in an open
                                    field through which we had passed, soon ceased. There was heavy firing in the
                                    afternoon, on the extreme right.

                                    soon quiet. At 9 A. M. a shot was fired which the rebels soon replied to from the
                                    ridge. our batteries opened with such vigor and precision that the rebels could fire
                                    but 3 shots. They are very still. At 5 P. M. the opened again from the ridge the
                                    contest was spirited, lasting more than 1/2 hour. At night fired on our camp. our
                                    battery replied with 33 shots, they firing 32.
                        June 21, Friday…..Almost no firing today, save by the
                                    "Pickets". At night the Chaplain (Charlot) assembled a small
                                    congregation for prayer, the first public worship that I have witnessed for weeks.
                        June 25, Saturday…..At 10 A. M. the rebels opened on our camp and works
                                    with their Artil on the ridge, lodging some of the shells in the works, while others
                                    bursted in front, rear, above and in the midst of our tents, scattering the whizing
                                    fragments in every direction Ceased at 11 1/2. our batteries continued firing,
                                    slowly. At 2 P. M. after we had become very careless, they suddenly fired from a
                                    full battery. in a very few moments all the men were in the works. Our guns soon
                                    silenced theirs At 6 P. M. a like feat was enacted with like results. At dark

               The Life of Johnny Reb. By Bell Irvin Wiley. (The Bobbs-Merrill Company, 
                        Indianapolis
                    , Indiana, 1943. Pp. 444. Illustrations. $3.50.)
            This attractive volume is not made up of edited source matter, but is a carefully written book based
                    on an extensive and close study of contemporary documents. Quotations from letters, diaries,
                    newspapers, and other sources enrich the text; but everything dovetails into the author's
                    own story in which he presents the activities, thoughts, and problems of Confederate soldiers as he
                    sees them after much patient research. The chapter headings are brief and suggestive. As the reader
                    proceeds, he comes to know "Johnny Reb" quite intimately and arrives at an
                    understanding of his strong points, his temptations, his hardships, his habits, his fighting
                    qualities, and his reactions to the smaller and larger aspects of the conflict. In regard to
                    sanitation, care of sick and wounded, food, clothing, sleeping facilities, religion, whisky, women,
                    heroism, cowardice, profanity, fellowship, discipline, the folks back home, and a host of other
                    things pertaining to the life of the soldiers of the South, an honest attempt is made to paint the
                    picture as it was—no better, no worse.
            Dr. Bell does not hesitate to interpret his sources and his account contains many conclusions
                    presented for the enlightenment of his readers. Considering the nature of the sources and the
                    extensive study necessary to extract their meaning, the method of presenting his gleanings used by
                    the author is entirely justifiable. The last chapter, entitled "What Manner of
                    Men," was the most difficult to write. The preceding chapters deal with the varied phases
                    of the lives of Confederates, but in the final chapter an attempt is made to sum up the findings.
                    This chapter, like the others, must be read to be appreciated. Probably those who know little about
                    the Civil War as well as those who know much will agree with Dr. Bell that "The average
                    Rebel private belonged to no special category"; that "He was in most respects an
                    ordinary person"; that, though he was far from perfect, "his achievements against
                    great odds in scores of desperate battles through four years of war is an irrefutable evidence of
                    his prowess and an eternal monument to his greatness as a fighting man."
            
            To one who has read many letters, diaries, and other first-hand accounts relative to the Union
                    soldier who was pitted against Johnny Reb, there is no avoiding the conclusion that a volume on the
                    life of the "Damned Yankee" would closely parallel the work under review. The
                    sources are very similar in nature and quality. The thoughts, temptations, problems, and experiences
                    of the men who made up the Blue and Grey armies were of the sane pattern. Insofar. as they thought
                    about or expressed themselves on the issues at stake, the language would have to be phrased
                    differently: but as to the men, they were as much alike as soldiers of opposing forces possibly
                    could be. This is simply further evidence that the soldiers on both sides were men of the same
                    country who were called on to wage a war that should never have been fought.

               Morgan and His Raiders. By Cecil Fletcher Holland. (
                        New York
                    : The MacMillan Company, 1943. Pp. xiii. 373. Illustrations. $3.50.)
            "The invasion of General Morgan will perhaps, for many years, hold the unique place in our
                    own state's history of being the only event of its kind." So wrote the late
                    Professor Logan Esarey with reference to the raid of John Morgan and his men across southeastern
                    Indiana during July, 1863. Starting from 
                        Tennessee
                     with about 2400 men, Morgan fought his way across 
                        Kentucky
                     to the Ohio River, crossed this stream at 
                        Brandenburg
                     on captured steamers, galloped north to 
                        Salem
                    , and then pursued a northeasterly course through 
                        Vernon
                     and Dupont. At the small town of Harrison the unwelcome intruders on free soil entered 
                        Ohio
                    ; they passed the outskits of 
                        Cincinnati
                    , and proceeded to hover closely to the river's northern bank until they
                    reached East Liverpool, 
                        Ohio
                    . where they were trapped and defeated by Federal forces. Many were killed, fewer than
                    400 escaped across the river, and the remnant was captured. Morgan, his officers, and about 250 of
                    his men were confined as common criminals in the penitentiary at 
                        Columbus
                    , from which the raider and five of his officers subsequently made a sensational escape.
            In this interesting book by Cecil F. Holland the greater part of three chapters is devoted to the
                    northern escapade,  whereas the remainder is devoted to
                    characterization of the personnel, to the organization by Morgan of his regiments, and to three
                    other important raids directed at his own beloved Bluegrass region in 
                        Kentucky
                    .
            It is certainly evident from the pages of this book that General Morgan had all the daring reckless
                    courage and trickery and much of the glamour of his eastern prototype, Jeb Stuart. As evidence of
                    this, Holland, taking his information from contemporary newspaper accounts, tells, among others, the
                    following amazing tale. Morgan and three hundred of his horsemen suddenly swooped down upon an
                    unnamed Indiana town presumably being protected by 300 local militiamen. "Whose company is
                    this?" inquired an aged Hoosier captain. "Wolford's [Federal]
                    cavalry," a Confederate replied. Thereupon the captain walked over to Morgan and saluted.
                    "Colonel, how are you?"
            "Bully! How are you?" replied the raider. "What are you going to do with
                    all these men and horses?"
            "Well, you see, that damned horse-thieving John Morgan is in this part of the country with a
                    parcel of cutthroats and thieves, and betwen you and I, if he comes this way, Captain,
                    we'll give him the best we've got in the shop….Colonel Wolford, spose
                    while you're restin' you and your company put your saddles on our horses and go
                    through a little evolution or two by the way of a lesson to our boys. I'm told
                    you're a horse on the drill, and the only man Morgan is afraid of."
            Morgan and his men obliged, made a quick change from their wornout horses to the fresh ones, and to
                    the everlasting amazement of the Home Guards, made off leaving "their frail tenement of.
                    bones" tied to the fence.
            Holland draws heavily upon the press comments which throughout the Old Northwest were excruciatingly
                    caustic and bitter in their attacks upon Morgan. The press regarded the raid as a cruel, marauding
                    expedition that served no legitimate military purpose, and as an intolerable desecration of the free
                    soil of the North. But to use the author's summary words: "The expedition, even if
                    it had ended in failure, drew off some of the forces which might have harassed Bragg's
                    retreat from Middle 
                        Tennessee
                     and helped Rosecrans at the battle of Chickamauga later on."
            The book as a whole is well documented. The author has  had
                    access to many materials not heretofore used, most important of which are Morgan's official
                    and personal correspondence, letter books, maps, broadsides, and accounts made available to him by
                    Mrs. Charles Ready Williamson, of 
                        Tennessee
                    . The files of the now scarce and remarkable Vidette,
                    Morgan's own official peripatetic newspaper, were also used.

            Many Americans, whose boys are in the armed forces today, will find much of interest in the record of
                    Theodore Upson, a Hoosier boy who entered the Union army and marched through 
                        Georgia
                     with General Sherman. The record, begun in 1858, reflected the mounting hostility to
                    slavery and the South in the minds of the people of northern Indiana. Entering the army at sixteen,
                    Upson described his experiences in camp at 
                        Indianapolis
                     and at 
                        Madison
                    , Indiana, before the 100th Indiana Volunteer Infantry, of which he was a member, was
                    sent to 
                        Tennessee
                     and 
                        Mississippi
                    . Transferred to Vicksburg, Upson was fortunate in getting into the town almost
                    immediately after its surrender. He was then sent to the 
                        Chattanooga
                     area, where he became a scout and hence saw more of the country and had more thrilling
                    experiences than was the lot of the common soldier. It seems that he had the happy facility of being
                    where important things were happening. He saw the charge up Missionary Ridge at the battle of 
                        Chattanooga
                    . From there he went with Sherman and was present at the battle of 
                        Atlanta
                    . He continued as a scout in Sherman's army until the end of the war. At the
                    very close he was permitted to go to 
                        Washington
                     in advance of the army and so gave an interesting description of the capital as the war
                    ended. His youth and his ability seem to have appealed to his comrades and his superiors; as a
                    result, his writings contain interesting details not usually found in a private's diary.
            Upson wrote the present record sometime after the Civil War, using diaries, journals, and letters
                    written at an earlier time. It is this, no doubt, that makes it such an interesting  combination of youthful expression and mature judgment. The editor has
                    divided it into sections and paragraphs, furnished topic captions and punctuation, and modified
                    capitalization according to modern standards. This revision by the author and the editor has
                    increased its readability, but it has also introduced changes in the original and contemporary
                    documents. It may well be that its usefulness has been only slightly lessened for the historian and
                    considerably increased for the general reader by this procedure. A slight imperfection appears in
                    the entry dated "[Summer], 1860," which relates events of the fall of 1860 and
                    tells of the election of 
                        Lincoln
                    . It is a highly interesting book and the editor has done an excellent piece of work.

                    which still stirs the resentment of many a Southerner. The war is indeed receding into the past.

            The "Watchdog of the Treasury," William Steele Holman, was southeastern
                    Indiana's contribution to the national scene in the days of "Uncle Joe"
                    Cannon, William McKinley, and "Czar" Reed. At times he appeared unnecessarily
                    parsimonious, as, for instance, when opposing adequate appropriations for developing the diplomatic
                    and consular service or for housing the library of Congress, or again, when walking back to
                    Bismarck, 
                        North Dakota
                    , to save the government steamboat fare. At other times he saved large sums of the
                    taxpayers' money from greedy politicians, lobbyists, and contractors. His years of
                    membership in the House of Representatives totaled more than those of any other representative
                    before him. Altogether, his accomplishments seem quite significant.
            He began his Congressional career in 1858 as a Democrat belonging to the Douglas wing of his party.
                    As a war Democrat he supported the prosecution of the Civil War and the preservation of the Union
                    but was very critical of Abraham 
                        Lincoln
                     and the Republican party.
            In retirement from 1865 to 1867, he returned to Congress for the remainder of the Reconstruction
                    period to 1877.  Opposed as he was to the Radical Republicans,
                    he was also unable to agree completely with President Johnson, although he voted against his
                    impeachment. His insistence upon economy began to be quite noticeable in this period. He was also
                    antagonistic to land grants to railroads, to the national banking system, to the contraction of the
                    currency, and to the "salary grab." Reform of civil service and the land system
                    drew his support.
            After a four years' absence, he was regularly reelected to the House of Representatives from
                    1881 to 1895. Opposing the extravagant appropriations of' this period, he gained national
                    fame as the "Watchdog of the Treasury." He considered unnecessary and sought to
                    prevent large naval expenditures and the enlargement of governmental services. As chairman of a
                    committee to investigate the expenditure of appropriations for the Indians, he contributed to the
                    passage of the Dawes Act of 1887, which inaugurated the modern Indian policy of the federal
                    government. He also supported the establishment of the Interstate Commerce Commissiom. He was
                    reelected in 1896, but death ended his long career early in the following year.
            There is a certain appropriateness in this unpretentious and solid biographical treatment of a plain
                    and unpretentious man, but one might suggest that the author could have made his work more
                    interesting by a greater emphasis upon the unique and picturesque features of his subject.
            The first two chapters of this work, which contain a brief sketch of Holman's father, Jesse
                    Lynch Holman, will probably draw more criticism than the remainder of the volume. The author had
                    less to work with in these chapters and his style reflects the fact. Probably the work should have
                    been restricted to the life of William S. Holman.
            The book is quite free from factual or typographical errors. Generally the author is critical of the
                    younger Holman, but the sketch of the elder leans too heavily upon obituary notices and other
                    complimentary remarks. Railroad regulation was omitted from the list of important Populist demands
                    (p. 216)' and 
                        Lincoln
                    's early policy was described in these words: "President 
                        Lincoln
                     merely waited as had Buchanan [p. 95]." Occasionally the narrative is marred
                    by ambiguity (pp. 193, 212). The footnotes are placed near the end of the volume,  an arrangement which penalizes the careful reader. The bibliography is
                    neither critical nor annotated.
            Readers of the Indiana Magazine of History will find that this book will make a
                    contribution to their knowledge, particularly of Indiana history. The lives of the Holmans extended
                    throughout the nineteenth century and illustrated many aspects of Indiana history. This biography is
                    an important addition to the historical literature of the state.

            A worthwhile contribution to the understanding of the effect and the implications of the Civil War
                    upon the life of the people of an essentially agrarian state is Professor Bettersworth's
                        Confederate 
                            Mississippi
                        
               . This is another in a group of scholarly monographs being brought out under
                    the auspices of the 
                        Louisiana
                     State University Press, which are throwing a new and keener light upon many hitherto
                    little-known aspects of southern history. The author, a native Mississippian, assistant professor of
                    history at 
                        Mississippi
                     State College and now serving in the 
                        United States
                     Navy, ably pictures the confusion and turmoil caused by the war.
            The first chapters sketch in the background for the coming struggle and describe the secession
                    convention of January, 1861, which took 
                        Mississippi
                     out of the Union and which reconvened in March, 1861, to pledge the allegiance of 
                        Mississippi
                     to the new government of the Confederate States of America. Various aspects of life in 
                        Mississippi
                    —political, economic and financial, social and religious—during
                    the Civil War are then taken up separately.
            A vivid and provocative picture of the governmental chaos in the state and in the Confederacy wrought
                    by the necessity of meeting new political problems brought by the changed allegiance and by the
                    stern problems of war make the chapter on "The Agony of Government" especially
                    valuable. The slowing down of judicial activity, the almost complete breakdown of criminal justice,
                    the passage of stay laws to prevent seizure of property for debts, and the futile attempts to
                    provide an adequate state financial structure admirably illustrate general problems which plagued 
                        Mississippi
                     officials during the war years. Perhaps the most valuable  parts of this volume are the five chapters which deal with economic and
                    financial matters: "Wartime Finance, 1861–1863"; "The
                    Financial Collapse"; "The Struggle for Economic Independence";
                    "Planter and Farmer in Wartime"; and "The Trade Through the
                    Lines." The lack of specie and the need for a circulating medium of exchange incited
                    legislative attempts to help the financial life of the state by the issuance of state paper. Such
                    attempts for the most part were disastrous, although, as Professor Bettersworth shows, 
                        Mississippi
                     state notes depreciated less rapidly than Confederate currency. The twin evils of
                    speculation and inflation added to the hardships of war suffered by the ordinary people, Too, the
                    very presence of the negro slaves on large plantations was an economic liability. The curtailing of
                    cotton production during the war left the negroes virtually useless as sources of profit. As
                    "non-producing consumers" they became a drag upon a way of economic life which had
                    been reduced to a subsistence economy by the circumscriptions and privations of war.
            Professor Bettersworth has used the available manuscript and printed sources with skill and
                    painstaking care. His interpretations are usually backed by a more than adequate array of sound
                    evidence. It is to be regretted, however, that his style of writing leads him into devious paths of
                    circumlocution which often obscure significant statements. Too, the author frequently predicates his
                    narrative upon an assumption of a familiarity with certain not-too-basic facts, supposing a
                    knowledge which even the professional historian may not always have. These minor flaws, while
                    detracting from the book in the eyes of the general reader, in no way impair the very real
                    excellence of Confederate 
                            Mississippi
                        
               . Dr. Bettersworth is to be commended for having done an excellent piece of
                    research, which reveals with piercing clarity the manifold political, social, and economic problems
                    facing the state of 
                        Mississippi
                     and the Confederacy in those war years.

               The Little Giant: The Story of Stephen A. Douglas and Abraham 
                            Lincoln
                        
               . By Jeannette Covert Nolan. (
                        New York

                    $2.50.)
            In writing The Little Giant, Mrs. Nolan has created a biography which is at once
                    entertaining and instructional to a  wide range of readers. For
                    the adult who knows the story of 
                        Lincoln
                     and Douglas, it provides a stimulating and refreshing experience. For the younger
                    reader it should make much more real and human the purely political and uninspiring story which he
                    will be expected to learn from his high school history book.
            In this biography state and national politics are pictured as forces which make great statesmen.
                    While the career of 
                        Lincoln
                     is secondary to that of Douglas throughout the story, the certainty of the conflict
                    between them is very early made clear. At first the political issues of the times appear to be made
                    to order for the display and exercise of Douglas' prowess. But as time goes on he becomes
                    less and less the master politician and more and more the man with a mission. In contrast, 
                        Lincoln
                     seems from the first to stand squarely on the moral issue of slavery, with political
                    interests playing a somewhat secondary role in his conduct. But the significant thing about Mrs.
                    Nolan's story lies in its gradually unfolding conception of 
                        Lincoln
                     and Douglas not as men with fundamentally conflicting purposes but as men with opposing
                    solutions for a problem endangering the Union, for which they would both sacrifice themselves.
            While not every reader may agree with this interpretation of Mrs. Nolan's story, none can
                    fail to note its emphasis on the sincerity of 
                        Lincoln
                     and Douglas and their mutual respect for each other throughout the years. The work of
                    Douglas in holding 
                        Illinois
                     for the Union, even after 
                        Lincoln
                    's inauguration, is a story not always known, even to many adult readers. The
                    same is true of Douglas' reason for wanting to organize the 
                        Nebraska
                     territory, a point which Mrs. Nolan explains at length.
            Other historical sidelights, which are brought into the narrative naturally and effectively, include
                    stories about such men as Andrew Jackson, who, as Douglas' guiding spirit from early youth,
                    is painted as a very human but very great figure. In contrast, Buchanan's disloyalty to his
                    party is forcefully presented; and the causes of the Mexican War, discussed earlier in the story,
                    are described simply and frankly. Of course, the excitement of state and national campaigns is
                    pictured vividly, and the famous debates are treated in detail as political events of the time.
            But with all its attention to politics and national problems 
                    this biography is still the story of 
                        Lincoln
                     and Douglas. Out of seemingly insignificant but really portentious events
                    Douglas' strong character and his democratic philosophy develop. In sharp contrast to his
                    background and in much less detail stands that of 
                        Lincoln
                    , sketched in skillfully from time to time as the occasion demands and with increasing
                    indication of his great destiny.
            To this skill in characterization and to her careful historical workmanship, evident in The Little Giant, Mrs. Nolan adds a style of writing admirably adapted to her subject.

            The people of Indiana should find this biography of the founder of Arbor Day very interesting and
                    significant. It is the story of one of 
                        Nebraska
                    's pioneer statesmen who became secretary of agriculture in 
                        Cleveland
                    's second administration and whose political career was cut short by that other
                    leader of the Cornhusker State, William Jennings Bryan. Born in 
                        New York
                     and raised in 
                        Michigan
                    , Morton attended the Wesleyan Seminary at Albion, 
                        Michigan
                    , and the state university at 
                        Ann Arbor
                    . From the latter he was expelled before graduation, as the result of criticism growing
                    out of the dismissal of a member of the faculty. The occasion was less discreditable to him than to
                    the university and it revealed a young man with a strong, determined character.
            He soon became a pioneer settler in 
                        Nebraska
                    , where he quickly reacted against his environment and the times by criticizing the
                    conduct of the Civil War and joining the party of the opposition. As a politician he was a failure,
                    but as an agriculturist he succeeded. Always a conservative, he opposed the Grange and the Alliance
                    and all for which they stood. For many years he served the 
                  Chicago, Burlington
               , and 
                        Quincy
                     Railroad as publicist, lobbyist, and agent. He was for a time the leading member of the
                    Democratic party in the state, but he favored the railroads and opposed the radicals, particularly
                    William J. Bryan. Often he made considerable sacrifices of time and money for his party, but he
                    preferred to see it defeated rather than to see it win under Bryan's leadership. As an
                    outstanding agriculturist and conservative  Democrat from west
                    of the 
                        Mississippi
                    , he was chosen by Grover 
                        Cleveland
                     to be the secretary of agriculture in his cabinet in the second term,
                    1893–1897.
            After the nomination of Bryan as the Democratic candidate for president and his defeat, Morton became
                    active in the National Sound Money League. He began the publication of The
                    Conservative on July 14, 1898, "in the interest of the conservation of all that is
                    deemed desirable in the social, industrial and political life of the 
                        United States
                    ." He wrote that "Riches and capital are nothing but the result of
                    industry and thrift," although he well know how railroads facilitated matters before
                    legislatures by the contribution of money for campaign purposes and indeed must have known of more
                    reprehensible uses which were prevalent in his state. He hoped to have a part in the formation of a
                    conservative party, but those who aided other of his activities would not join in this endeavor. No
                    doubt the railroad interests were too realistic to desire such a division in politics, when they had
                    done fairly well in finding leaders to represent them in both of the older parties.
            The most important defect of this book is that the author did not see what Morton also failed to see:
                    that the farmers, hard pressed by climatic and economic conditions, were being exploited by the
                    railroads of the West even to the point of tragedy. Indeed, Morton was not only a conservative but
                    he was also an agent of the railroads in defeating the citizens of 
                        Nebraska
                     in the use of political agencies to check this exploitation. His enemies called him a
                    railroad "tool." Morton's ability deserved greater rewards than he
                    received; the explanation is to be found in his rejection by the people of the state because he
                    chose to serve the railroads rather than the people. It seems quite possible, however, that his
                    political activity, which consumed so much of his energy, will be forgotten as a struggle against
                    the dominant tendencies of his day, and that his work in planting trees and founding Arbor Day will
                    prove to be his important contribution to his state and nation.
            Perhaps the above-mentioned defect is due to the materials used. The extensive Morton Collection of
                    manuscripts of the University of 
                        Nebraska
                     Library must have consumed much of the author's time. The list of newspapers
                    used is fairly comprehensive, but there is not a representative of the  Farmers' Alliance on the list, although the 
                        Nebraska
                     State Historical Society possesses several such files. There are also certain theses
                    which represent this side of 
                        Nebraska
                    's history, which were not listed in the bibliography and must therefore be
                    assumed not to have been used.
            In most other respects the work is admirably done. It is well written, amply documented, and very
                    adequately supplied with illustrations and possesses a good index and an excellent format. It has
                    been carefully proofread and is not marred by the little slips that detract from so many works. The
                    book will amply repay its readers. The author and the University of 
                        Nebraska
                     Press are to be congratulated for writing and publishing so creditable a volume.

               The Dufour Saga, 1796–1942. By Julie LeClere 
                        Knox
                    . (Craw-fordsville, Ind.: Howell-Goodwin Printing Co., 1942. Pp. 166, appendix.
                    $3.15.)
            The early history of southern Indiana is one of fine pioneers, who, after constructing homes,
                    insisted on a place of worship and a school, who observed the law and respected property. Many of
                    their descendants have quietly fashioned our state. Wherever others settled, they have done their
                    share to better their communities.
            This book is the brief chronicle of one such remarkable family—the French Swiss founders
                    of 
                        Vevay
                    , Indiana—whose personalities stand out delightfully, as related by a
                    great-granddaughter living today in the ancestral home.
            It is the record of five sturdy sons and three daughters of the one-time judge and mayor of Montreux, 
                        Switzerland
                    , whose eldest son, Jean Jacques Dufour, having read, as a lad of fourteen, that 
                        Lafayette
                    's soldiers in the American Revolution bewailed the lack of wine in our
                    otherwise abundant country, had long dreamed of one day introducing on a large scale the culture of
                    the vine in the new world.
            In 1796 he landed in 
                        Philadelphia
                     and late in 1800 selected sixty-three acres in Jessamine County, 
                        Kentucky
                    , for his experiment. He named this land "First Vineyard." The
                    following year his brothers and sisters left their comfortable home in 
                        Switzerland
                     to join him in the wilderness, with their father's admonition to respect and
                    obey their eldest brother, to have preaching as often as they could, to read the ninetieth  Psalm when preaching was impossible, and to read this Psalm at
                    funerals. This last custom is still carried out by all his descendants. With the Dufour children,
                    all under twenty, came other French Swiss to the "First Vineyard"—the
                    Borally family, Philippe Bettens and his family, the Siebenthals, father and son, and Jean Morerod.
                    By 1813 all the colony had moved to better land on the Ohio River, to
                    "Indiana Vineyard," twenty-five hundred acres purchased by the Dufour brothers
                    from Congress on extended credit.
            Jean Francois and Jean Daniel Dufour now laid out the town of 
                        Vevay
                     and in 1814 gave two town lots and $2500 to secure it as the county seat.
                    They supplied the deficit for the erection of the first courthouse and jail and established the
                    first bank, the first post office, and the first newspaper. Jean Daniel was one of the first three
                    directors of the first literary society of the town. Every Sabbath he read to the colonists sermons
                    many of which had been written by his father and sent from 
                        Switzerland
                    . These two brothers became the most prominent citizens, held many public offices, and
                    built fine homes, which still stand.
            Antoinette Dufour married Jean Daniel Morerod. In their poorer days they had no cow; when unable to
                    obtain milk from their neighbors for their morning coffee they simply inhaled the odor of the coffee
                    from the rag in which it was pounded.
            The next sister, Suzanne, married a Swiss man by the name of Elisha Golay, prominent in civic and
                    military lines. Jeanne Marie married a Siebenthal, who became the first sheriff of 
                        Switzerland
                     County and a leading member of the Swiss settlement.
            The American preference for whisky dampened the ardor for grape growing, and the colonists turned to
                    farming and other pursuits. Although Jean Jacques Dufour's original plans were never
                    fulfilled, he helped establish this thriving colony; and 
                        Vevay
                     today has many mementoes of its early fathers, who founded and carried on a settlement
                    of which the state of Indiana is justly proud.

            This little pamphlet is characterized by some very dubious reasoning, the author trying to prove that 
                        Lincoln
                     read  certain college texts. He was often unable to
                    find documentary evidence to strengthen his suppositions. Had he been content to stick to a few
                    books or to his general proposition, his position would have appeared more tenable. 
                        Lincoln
                     was certainly not as uneducated as he suggested in his autobiographical sketch of 1860,
                    and in all probability read various texts which were owned by some of his neighbors, but his
                    connection with several books discussed by the author is based purely on supposition.

            The task of bridging the gap from the events described on the final pages of textbooks to the present
                    day is often a difficult one for the teacher of history. This is particularly true of teachers who
                    find it necessary to use older editions of texts. Likewise, many persons find it difficult to
                    arrange in their memory a systematic scheme of events in these hurried and busy times. This little
                    pamphlet by Professor Sellers, of the university of 
                        Nebraska
                    , will be of considerable service to these people. It will help to clarify their ideas
                    about the outbreak of the present war. It stresses the foreign relations phase of our history but
                    does not neglect the the domestic story. It also contains a brief bibliography of recently published
                    books.

            John Kennedy Graham was born January 30, 1783, in 
                        Bedford
                     County, 
                        Pennsylvania
                    . Some time before 1810 he came to Indiana Territory, married Elizabeth Weach, and
                    settled first in what is now 
                        Clark County
                    ; later he moved to the site of the present New 
                        Albany
                    . In 1816 he was elected to the convention which met in Corydon to frame the
                    state's first constitution. He also served in the House of Representatives of Indiana in
                    the sessions of 1816–1817, 1825, and 1827–1828, and in the Senate,
                    1826–1826. A surveyor by profession, he laid out the city of New 
                        Albany
                     in 1813 and ran the boundary lines for some of the newly formed counties; he did some
                    of the surveying of the 
                        Michigan
                     Road and the Wabash River as well. In August, 1841, he died at his
                    home near New 
                        Albany
