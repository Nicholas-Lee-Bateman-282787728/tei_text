                PREFACE
                Once when the writer was examining a landscape, upon which a castle, a lake, a
                    fertile plain, a river, some mountains and various other objects appeared, he
                    asked the artist from what particular place the scene was taken. The answer,
                    given with Teutonic solemnity, was: "Es ist componirt!' Now it
                    has been assumed that the following narrative is an authentic autobiography.
                    This is by no means the fact, for while recollections of personal experiences,
                    as well as the knowledge of what others have done and thought, have all been
                    very freely used; they have been combined with each other and with imaginary
                    occurrences in such a way as to constitute no true story of the life of any
                    particular person, though it is hoped their main features are essentially true
                    of a certain class of persons who lived just before and during the Civil War,
                    and that they are not inconsistent with the vital characteristics of human
                    nature itself.

                        CHAPTER I
                        THE HOME
                        THE scenes and faces that come forth from the mist
                            which hides my childhood, are not often of distinguished persons or of
                            important events. And yet, no doubt, they were important to me then or
                            else memory (though she is capricious enough in choosing out of a
                            thousand incidents, the single circumstance that she will cherish) would
                            hardly have preserved these few things from amid the general wreckage of
                            forgetfulness. Naturally I recall the main features of the house where I
                            was born and in which I passed the first years of my life, though even
                            here there are only a few outlines that come forth distinctly.
                        The house was one of a row of eight brick dwellings in a side street in
                            the lower part of New York City, a neighborhood which is now in the
                            tenement house district, but was then very quiet and respectable.
                        These eight dwellings were uniform, except that the stone "stoops" of the
                            two middle houses (of  which ours was one)
                            were joined together and from that central point the others seemed to my
                            childish imagination to slope away in dignity and importance on each
                            side until they reached the two streets which formed the East and West
                            boundaries of this little world. There was also, as mother told me, a
                            very important distinction. The four houses upon our
                            side had been built "by day's work" the other four had been
                            put up "by contract" and therefore leaked more and needed repairs
                            oftener and were in every respect greatly inferior.
                        In front of each house there was a little square dooryard with a small
                            grass plat and a black iron railing. I used to examine the design of
                            that railing with great care in the days when I played in the dooryard,
                            being too little to be trusted in that great, seething, perilous,
                            unknown worldthe street. Somewhere amid the intricacies of the
                            design there were smooth strips of iron that curled round and round, for
                            I used to put my little fingers on the inside of the curve and follow it
                            as it grew smaller and smaller out to the end. I can feel now the
                            strange sensation and the sudden stoppage when the iron with a little
                            final twist went off into nothing, and I had to begin again and do it
                            over.
                        Under our "stoop" was a door opening into the "entry," a lower hall,
                            which led through the house to the back yard, passing on its way the
                            dining-room and the kitchen. On this door was a brass knocker. How well
                            I remember that! For every  afternoon, when
                            father came home, he always gave five raps upon it, first two slow ones
                            and then three very fast, "Rattattat-tat-tat"
                            just as a drummer beats his drum. That was the mystic signal
                            to tell me it was he, and I would run flying to the door and bound into
                            his arms as he entered! And then we would have our romp together on the
                            basement floor! But I always thought it unfair that just when I was on
                            top and had gotten him nicely under and had his hair or his
                            ears in my little fingers, he would say, "There now! That is enough for
                            today!" when it seemed to me that the best of the fun was only
                            beginning!
                        In a corner, by the window, stood a rush-bottomed settee, a pretty piece
                            of furniture and quite old, for it had been made according to the plain
                            yet delicate taste of the early part of the century. On that settee I
                            can see grandmother, then more than ninety years of age, sitting in her
                            plain Quaker garb, on the day when I first wore trousers and rushed
                            madly through the house calling upon everybody to behold me in my new
                            glory. Whereupon she raised her hands and exclaimed "Hoity-toity!"
                        That was all, but it was enough. It was the concentrated essence of
                            admiration, and no Roman conqueror returning with spolia
                                opima after the subjugation of an empire, in his triumphal
                            march through the Eternal City, ever relished the plaudits of the throng
                            with any greater zest than I drank in the flattery of that exclamation
                            and those upraised  arms. The conqueror, to
                            mar his joy, had at his side a slave reminding him that he was still a
                            man. But to me that was the splendor of it! I was a man, indeed, and the
                            proofs were there upon my pudgy little legs!
                        But soon came the descent from Paradise, when the skirts had to be put on
                            again with tears and sobs and the conviction that life was not worth
                            living.
                        The kitchen, Katy's realmKaty, the cookseems dimmer
                            to me. There is the range certainly and the table at the other side
                            where Katy and Nancy used to sew of evenings by the light of a little
                            whale-oil lamp, a brown, pear-shaped bulb, perched upon the top of a
                            straight stalk. The wick was pushed up by the point of a pin whenever
                            the flame burned low. When I tried to do it the pin always became so hot
                            I could not hold it and I wondered how Katy dared put her finger right
                            into the flame to brush away the lampblack. It was at this table I
                            learned how to sew, though I never could use a thimble, but took the
                            needle between my thumb and forefinger, and if the cloth was stout
                            (especially at the corner of a hem where there were four thicknesses) I
                            had to push the needle against the table or the wall to make it go
                            through.
                        Then I remember the tubs that were brought forth every Monday morning
                            from some unknown depths, when Diana came to do the washing.
                        Our Diana differed from the divine huntress in many waysin
                            color, form, costume and calling.  Our
                            Diana was a "sable goddess" her hue was the blackest ebony
                            that ever shone upon the human form. Not even old Abbie, nor Anastase,
                            nor Peter Still (the slave who bought his freedom and wrote a book)
                            could compare with Diana in the midnight inkiness of her complexion. She
                            was large enough, however, to be a dweller on Olympus, being over six
                            feet tall. She was raw-boned and angular. Her costume was less airy than
                            that of the chaste Artemis, and above her head, in lieu of the crescent,
                            there radiated the bright hues of a wonderful bandana; in place of bow
                            and quiver, the washboard was the constant symbol and implement of her
                            calling; and as for Actæon, he was a small boy, and it was not the
                            hounds nor the curses of the deity, but certain puffs of steam from the
                            boiler on the range diffusing an intolerable hot moisture through the
                            kitchen that drove him to flight.
                        Our back yard was laid out in conventional form. There were two
                            rectangular grass plats with a stone path between and around them, and
                            narrow flower-beds outside next to the high board fence.
                        What treasures there were in those flower-beds! The blue morning-glories
                            that glittered with the dew, the saucy "johnny-jump-ups" (for they never
                            shall be pansies to me), the lady's-ear-drops and the violets and, most
                            wonderful of all, the tiger-lilies with petals orange-red, upon which
                            were little black specks that looked as if you had spattered ink upon
                            them from your pen. And from the sides of the  slender stalk sprouted long, narrow leaves, glossy, with
                            little furrows running lengthwise, and when you broke a leaf there were
                            filaments like the threads of a spider's webone thread at each
                            furrowthat still held the parts together. And then, just at
                            the point where the leaf joined the stalk, there was a little brown
                            ball, as small as the smallest pea, and if you pushed your thumb against
                            it to separate it from the leaf, it felt as though you were shelling
                            peas, but found only on in the pod.
                        There were other curiosities in the yardthe little communities
                            of ants that dug their dwellings in the cracks between the flagstones.
                            Many an hour have I watched them during the summer afternoons, and
                            brought them crumbs which had to be very fine so that they could drag
                            them through the hole in the ant-hill. Patient, perservering little
                            fellows they, who worked with much method, and who would go one to
                            another and lay their hands one on another's shoulders and whisper
                            together confidentially in some ant language, and occassionally one of
                            them would summon half a dozen others and they would toil in unison upon
                            a crumb bigger than the rest to store it in their dark pantry again the
                            winter time. I was astonished at the courage of the tiny creatures. They
                            did not run away from me nor try to hide, though I could have trampled
                            them all with a single pressure of my foot. I thought how it would scare
                                me to see a man come walking by whose foot was
                            bigger than our house, and I admired their 
                            pluck, as I admire it still. So I was very careful not to harm them,
                            unless perhaps the wheels of my velocipede may have incontinently
                            crushed them as it rattled over the stone walk.
                        Ah! that velocipede! What a joy to propel it by the levers at the side
                            and steer it with my feet by the small wheel in front. It was as good as
                            driving a coach and four! There was the consciousness of power over the
                            little wooden beast whose mane flowed gracefully down from his neck in
                            front of me. And I found that velocipedes, like horses, are sometimes
                            fractious, for once when I tried to make him go backward, my steed
                            balked and sent me to the ground on the back of my head, giving me my
                            first glimpse of those strange constellations that shine as brightly in
                            the daytime as they do at night.
                        But I must go back to the house again. Above the basement there were
                            three stories. The first of these, of course, was occupied by the
                            parlors. There were two of them with great doors of mahogany
                            betweendoors that slid so smoothly upon the rail beneath, that
                            it was joy to roll them back and forth and see them fit together in the
                            middle. There was no piano, for our family were "consistent Friends." We
                            belonged to what was commonly called the Hicksite branch of the Society,
                            though father did not like the name. We were "Friends," he said, or
                            sometimes "Our Friends," to distinguish us from the
                            "Orthodox" "who went off from us" at the time of the "separation."
                        
                        With both branches of the Society, however, music was regarded as one of
                            the subtle agencies by which the Prince of Evil corrupts the souls of
                            men, and now and then a Friend was "disowned" by the Monthly Meeting for
                            having a piano in his house.
                        I remember one day a new carpet was laid upon the parlor
                            floorsa Brussels carpet with big brown leaves upon a green
                            ground, as if the late Autumn had dropped its faded foliage from the
                            trees upon a turf still green with the verdure of the summer. The carpet
                            was plain enough, no doubt, in realityyet what a wonderful
                            work of art did it seem to my child's eyes!
                        And then the window shades! They were made of light buff linen well oiled
                            and with a broad gilt stripe near the edges. When they became old and
                            dingy, they were removed and plain white shades took their places, and
                            some time afterwards when a number of new articles were purchased which
                            seemed to me "more worldly" than the sober furniture to which we had
                            been accustomed, I spoke to mother with some concern, and asked her if
                            we were not getting "too gay," and she answered that she thought not,
                            reminding me that the new windowshades were "plainer" than the old
                            ones.
                        Behind the parlors was the back porch with a stairway down to the yard
                            below. The floor of the porch was not painted, but the boards were well
                            scrubbed, and looked better and would last just as long, said mother, as
                            if they had a dozen coats. It  was under
                            the cover of this porch that I used to sit with father and admire the
                            glory of the thunder storms, though sometimes I was frightened when a
                            loud peal rang out and shook the earth. Here, too, we watched a great
                            comet with its immense tail that stretched half across the heavens. And
                            here one night we saw the sky gleam with a great, throbbing, fiery glare
                            above a lumber-yard back of our premises, and I can remember the awe I
                            felt at the wild flames that leaped as high as a church spire, flames
                            that the red-shirted firemen could not quench until all was
                            consumed.
                        Above the parlors were the rooms of my
                            grand-parentsgrandmother's in front, and grandfather's
                            behindand I had to go by the doors of these two chambers very
                            quietly on my way upstairs, for grandfather and grandmother were very
                            old. The hall bedroom belonged to Auntie, and I used to pass the door of
                            that with still greater awe, for one night while I was yet a very little
                            boy, I had entered this room and had seen a dreadful sight! There was a
                            small foot bathtub upon the floor. It was very dark, but the stars shone
                            down through the windows and were reflected upward by the water in that
                            tub until it seemed to me there was a deep hole in the floor that went
                            clear through the earth and came out into the starlight on the other
                            side. For months afterwards the room was a chamber of horrors to be
                            slipped past as quickly and stealthily as possible on my way to bed.
                        
                        Our own bedroom was upon the third floorfather's, mother's and
                            mine. Later, after grandmother died, we moved down to the second floor.
                            But the upper roomthe room where I was born, stands out most
                            vividly in my memory. Here there were two beds, a broad one with low
                            bedposts made of light-colored wood and fashioned at the ends into the
                            shape of large, smooth acorns with the point of the acorn on top. Next
                            to this was a narrow bed with posts a little higher. I lay in the middle
                            so that I could not fall out. But one morning father and mother went
                            down to breakfast, leaving me asleep and, although mother raised huge
                            piles of pillows and bolsters on each side of me to make escape
                            impossible, I rolled over them and tumbled on the floor, followed by a
                            confused mass of stifling thing, whereupon I cried lustily, imagining
                            the general destruction of the world, until all the household hurried
                            around me, panting and exclaiming and pitying me until I was frightened
                            more at their terrified faces than at the fall itself.
                    
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER II
                        MOTHER
                        NATURALLY, the first features that come to me from
                            among the figures of the past, are the high forehead, the brown hair and
                            the tender gray eyes of my mother.
                        I can hardly tell whether or not I thought that her face was beautiful.
                            The idea of beauty did not occur to me in that connection. It was a dear
                            face, for it was mother'sthat was all.
                        But mother had certainly been handsome in her youth and had had many
                            admirers. She was the youngest of the children of Joseph and Martha
                            Thrivewell, and had been much petted and perhaps a little spoiled, and I
                            noticed that whenever there was any difference of opinion in the family,
                            it was always her way of thinking that prevailed. She had no other
                            children; all the inexhaustible treasures of her love were concentrated
                            as by a burning glass, wholly upon her little son, and he suffered from
                            the excess of her affection.
                        Poor mother! I could hardly leave her sight! Every draught of air, every
                            sneeze, every mosquitobite was the subject of her most anxious care. She
                            had lost two children in the earliest hours of their infancy and a third
                            (my brother Freddie) had been  carried off
                            by scarlet-fever when he was only three years old. I was all that was
                            left to her, and the one hope and aim of her life was to keep me from
                            the destroyer who had so ruthlessly torn away her earlier treasures. At
                            the least sign of a cough or a sore throat I was put to bed. In winter I
                            had half an hour's exercise in the back yard and built my little snow
                            fort upon the grass plat with a muffler wound round and round my neck up
                            to my ears. I must not run and "get over-heated"; I must not read
                            "exciting books"; I must not go out in the night air, nor in the hot
                            sun, nor in the rain, nor in the morning while the dew was on the grass.
                            All life, whichever way I turned, was surrounded by a bristling bayonet
                            line of "don'ts." Father used to remonstrate sometimes against making a
                            "hot house plant" of me, as he called it, but nothing could stifle the
                            mad mother eagerness, which sought to shelter her one remaining child
                            even from the lightest breath of heaven.
                        Our family physician was a Dr. Hobson, a hale old man, with light
                            eyebrows and a small brown wig that did not match, a man who lived to be
                            more than ninety years of age, and who attributed his ruddy cheeks and
                            his excellent health and spirits to the strict diet which he always
                            observedno fruits, no sweetmeats, no puddings, no pies, no
                            coffee, no buckwheat cakes. He was a man filled with the idea that what
                            had been so good for him ought to be good for everybody.
                        
                        "Buckwheat cakes, madam! Why, a single buckwheat cake would set my head
                            whirling like a top! The boy must never touch them!"
                        I often wondered at this, for grandfather, who was also ninety years old
                            (ninety seemed to me a mystic number), had every morning a pile of
                            buckwheat cakes upon his plate for breakfast, and they never seemed to
                            hurt him. But boys and grandfathers were very
                            different things!
                        Even water, according to the good doctor, was very dangerous, and once
                            when he was told that I had taken two whole tumblerfuls at one time, he
                            came close to my bedside and said to me in a low, solemn tone: "If you
                            keep doing such things as that, you'll never grow big." At first I
                            wondered whether I was to be a dwarf like Tom Thumb, then it occurred to
                            me that he meant I would die.
                        But, according to the doctor, although there were very few things that
                            were good to eat, yet there were a great many medicines that were good
                            to take when you were ill, and these were the very vilest and nastiest
                            of all.
                        Mother used to say she liked the doctor because he gave so little
                            medicine, and dangerous medicines like calomel he hardly ever
                            prescribed. But the things he gave were bad enough in all conscience.
                            Castor oil (whose supposed virtues corresponded with its awful taste),
                            cod-liver oil, salts and senna, ginger tea, and, worse than these,
                            enormous doses of sweet, sickening ipecac! Every few weeks I had an
                            attack  of croup. I have reason to think
                            now that these visitations were of the most trifling character and all
                            that I needed was to be let alone, but I had to lie for days in bed
                            studying the figures on the quilt before me, and taking great spoonfuls
                            of that horrible stuff, the object of which was to make me sick at my
                            stomach, an object which it always accomplished. At last the mere sight
                            and smell of the detestable medicine was quite enough. It would fulfil
                            its mission before a drop had passed my lips. While I was ill my diet
                            consisted of toast, "cambric tea" and "panada," a compound of soda
                            crackers, a very little sugar and a great deal of warm water. I used to
                            wonder what it was that made the pieces grow so big, and why there was
                            so much cracker and so little taste after they were put in the
                            water.
                        Once, when Dr. Hobson was ill, mother called in Doctor Senf, who lived
                            near by, but the only difference I could see was that Dr. Senf came
                            oftener and made me lie in bed a great deal longerlong after I
                            was wellso that I became quite reconciled to Doctor
                            Hobson.
                        Whenever I went out into the street, mother always went with me. She
                            would not trust me to my nurse, nor to my father, nor even to Auntie.
                            Mother's walks were generally for shopping purposes, which seemed to me
                            a dreary businessthere were so many things that would not fit,
                            or for some reason would not do.
                        I was a lonely boy, being the only child in the  house and having few companions, for mother was as much
                            afraid of the blighting influence of other children as she was of the
                            night air. Once in a long while Georgie Underwood or Roger Baker came to
                            see me, or perhaps little Nellie Taylor, but most of my time was spent
                            either alone or with grown-up people. I had not even a dog, nor a bird,
                            nor a pussy cat, and my playthings were not only inanimate, but there
                            was always a dose of instruction in them. Even my cardboard games, so
                            interesting on account of the beautiful pictures, had vast stores of
                            unwelcome admonition, and as I shook the dice and made spasmodic and
                            halting progress along the "River of Life" to the "Temple of Wisdom" at
                            the end I found that 25, "Industry" always told me to go to 47,
                            "Success" and 31, "Cruelty" to go back to 14, "Remorse." So continuously
                            did a moral beset my path that I came to believe like the Duchess of
                            "Alice in Wonderland," that there must be "a moral in everything if you
                            can only find it," until in disgust I used to wonder why a boy could not
                            be allowed to do some useless thing just for the fun
                            of it.
                        Thus it was I became a solemn little fellow, old in some ways beyond my
                            years, yet in most things unspeakably green and unsophisticated. I think
                            that fifty years ago the grown-up world did not have quite the sympathy
                            with the child life that it has now. We have to-day our kindergartens
                            and our various systems for sugar-coating the pill of instruction.  Flogging is almost unknown, the flames of
                            hell have lost much of their terrors, and fear is everywhere a less
                            potent factor in the government of mankind. As Gladstone says: "We have
                            lived into a gentler time," and human happiness has, on the whole, been
                            greatly promoted by the change. And yet in all this gain perhaps there
                            has been something of a loss as well. The character that develops
                            according to its own methods, untrammeled by limitations from without,
                            may grow more luxuriantly, but it sometimes shows the need, as well as
                            the lack, of pruning. The youth who grows to manhood with no restraint
                            has little power to "rule his own spirit" and set himself with dogged
                            determination to the doing of those tiresome and unpleasant things which
                            still have to be done, if life is to be lived successfully. Drudgery,
                            like adversity, has its sweet uses.
                        Mother taught me to read and taught me well, but the range of the reading
                            allowed me was very narrow. Fairy tales and nursery rhymes, as well as
                            dramas and novels were forbidden. "Robinson Cruscoe" and the "Arabian
                            Nights" were unknown to me until I could no longer read them with the
                            relish of youth. Even "Mother Goose's Melodies" came into my hands by
                            accident, for mother had asked father to bring me a new game called
                            "Mother Goose," which had been advertised in the newspapers, and he,
                            misunderstanding the message, had brought me the rhymes, all with
                            appropriate pictures. He had to take the book back at once  and exchange it for the game, but
                            fortunately he had brought it home upon "Seventh Day" evening, and he
                            could not return it until "Second Day" morning, so I had the intervening
                            Sabbath for my profit. I know not how I came to be left alone with that
                            book, but so prodigious was my hunger for such things and so excellent
                            my memory that by Monday morning I knew nearly every rhyme in that
                            little blue volume from beginning to end "Hiccory, Diccory,
                            Dock," "Humpty Dumpty," and all the rest of them. After that I did not
                            need the book. I had it all in my delighted little headand it
                            has remained there down to the date of these presents.
                        Shakespeare was kept out of the house as a dangerous character. Fiction
                            in verse was for some occult reason considered less harmful than fiction
                            in prose, provided the story itself was unobjectionable. Thus, "The Lady
                            of the Lake" was a favorite, while "Marmion" was forbidden ground. Books
                            of adventure, as is well known, are pitfalls for any boy whose parents
                            intend that he shall lead a sober and sensible life. I used to hear from
                            others of the wonders of Mayme Reid, but all the delights of his wild
                            tales were barred from me until one of my friends loaned me "The Scalp
                            Hunters." I had to hide it under the sofa in the parlor and creep in to
                            devour it when no one was near. Oh, what a glory it would be, thought I,
                            to lead the life there depicted! Amid scenes of carnage and hair-breadth
                            escapes there were a few pages devoted to a young  girl of great alleged attractions, called Zoe. What a
                            creature she was! And what a name! For years afterward whenever I saw a
                            fair face, the name seemed to fly to it and become part of the beauty
                            that I worshiped.
                        History formed a large part of the literature allowed me and I absorbed
                            it eagerly. Having been told to "take exercise," and there being no
                            other exercise to take indoors, I would throw my indiarubber ball over
                            and over against the wall above the kitchen range and catch it on the
                            first bounce from the floor, and when I could stand this no longer I
                            would rush off to my Roman history and devour some thrilling episode
                            like the "Assanation of Julius Caesar," as I called it when I told the
                            story to a young friend and we talked of it in solemn whispers
                            together.
                        I wonder if any boy ever enjoyed the study of geography as I did, while I
                            lay on my stomach on the floor and pored over the atlases and imagined I
                            was traveling through the strange lands they described. So well did I
                            learn the contour of the continents that I could draw them pretty
                            accurately without looking on the map at all. For some reason not very
                            clear, Africa was, of all the great divisions of the world, by far the
                            most seductive. There was a charm about its shape, and the great tract
                            marked "unexplored" that looked so plain and empty (a tract which has
                            now vanished), filled me with an irresistible desire to go and find out
                                 what was in ita desire that
                            was further stimulated by reading some of Uncle Ephraim's books of
                            explorations upon the outskirts of that unknown region. Next after
                            Africa came Greenland, then South Americaall the places in
                            short that were far off and inaccessible. Perhaps my preference was part
                            of the same instinct that has led me in later years to eschew the beaten
                            lines of travel and to prefer by-ways and the remote valleys and the
                            inns that are not laid down in Baedecker. In short, it is part of the
                            Anglo-Saxon instinct of the explorer, a childish impulse, if you will,
                            but one that has led to the domination of that race, and is leading
                            America to-day upon its world career.
                        What boy is there who sees no vistas of glory opening before him? I had
                            many suchamong them a dream as wild as Alexander's, for by
                            untold exertions and acts of heroism I was some day to win for myself
                            the universal scepter over all mankind, and when I looked upon the map
                            of the world for some central location on which to establish my
                            capitalsome place equally accessible to both
                            continentsit seemed to me that the Azores occupied a place
                            which would be generally convenient for everybody, quite handy to Europe
                            and Africa, and not so very far from America. From such a vantage ground
                            I felt I could deal impartially with both continents and give humanity a
                            reign of unparalleled beneficence. When I saw the Azores many years
                            afterwards they did not seem quite so  fit
                            a place as I had thought. I always kept very quiet about this scheme of
                            world empire, however, for somehow I feared that even my best friends
                            might laugh at it.
                        But this was only one of my dreams. I was also going to be a great poet.
                            One of the notes to "Paradise Lost" had said that epic poetry was the
                            noblest kind, so I planned great epics which were to surpass the
                            masterpieces of Milton, and I tried to find some heroes more "sublime"
                            than his. But my quest was like the conundrum: "What is greater than
                            God, worse than the devil, and kills a man if he eats it?" and the
                            answer to my search was the same: "Nothing at all." Milton had found the
                            greatest. Even an epic with George Washington for its hero would hardly
                            be quite so sublime as "Paradise Lost"!
                        I saw myself in imagination leading vast armies in procession to some
                            unknown pinnacle of glory, and to give my fancy tangible shape, I
                            collected great multitudes of spools and then lifting the leaves of the
                            mahogany dining-table, I arranged these in companies and regiments upon
                            its ample surface, according to the size of the spools. The biggest one
                            was the commander in chief (that was I). The next in size were just
                            plain generalsthen followed the colonels, the captains and the
                            smallest of all were the privates, which, like the soldiers in the late
                            Cuban war, bore a very small ratio to the number of officers who
                            commanded them. The troops  on my side were
                            white spools, and those on the other side were black ones. My order of
                            battle was taken from my observation of the target companies that passed
                            the door, and there was never any doubt upon which side would perch the
                            eagles of victory.
                        Yet with all these dreams of military fame, I was greatly frightened by
                            loud and sudden noises. This fear dated from early childhood when once a
                            locomotive just opposite the window of the railway car at which I sat
                            gave a wild shriek which nearly sent me into convulsions. I never got
                            over the effect of it, and for a long time I was afraid to watch even
                            those target companies and hear the great drum go bang, but used to run
                            back to the kitchen and there, supported by Katy as a strong reserve, I
                            would peep through the keyhole till the band had gone by. Then I would
                            rush out to watch the "soldiers" and the colored man who carried behind
                            them the target with a big wreath upon it for the victor.
                        Since fairy tales were denied me, I knew little of that dread of ghosts,
                            hobgoblins, genii and evil spirits which so often besets the path of
                            childhood. My fears took quite another shape. I had a big book on
                            natural history, and the dreadful beasts which were shown and described
                            in its pages, the bears, wolves, lions, tigers and mighty serpents
                            filled me with awe. Worst of all there was a picture of a terrific
                            hippopotamus with wide-open jaws and big, 
                            distorted teeth, so dreadful that I used to turn over the leaf quickly
                            whenever I came upon it. As I went up to bed I would pass all the dark
                            corners very fast lest some of these monsters should suddenly pounce out
                            upon me, and I often looked under the bed to be sure that some bear, or
                            perhaps an awful hippopotamus was not there to swallow me up after I had
                            gone to sleep.
                        Mother encouraged me in the habit of making a silent prayer before going
                            to bed, but as I used to stay on my knees a long while she at last
                            became curious to know what all this praying was about. I did not want
                            to tell her, but at last I owned that I was asking the Lord if there
                            were any lion, tiger, bear, wolf, snake, rhinoceros, elephant or
                            hippopotamus in the house, that he would send them away quick and not
                            let them get hold of me.
                        There was one book that used to excite me, however, as much as any ghost
                            story could possibly do, and that was "Pilgrim's Progress." The Castle
                            of the Giant Despair filled me with indescribable terrors, and once when
                            I was reading about the Valley of the Shadow of Death, I saw the type in
                            front of me grow smaller and smaller and then go far away, miles and
                            miles away, as it seemed to me, and yet I could read it all the same,
                            and I went on reading till I was nearly beside myself for
                            fearand tossed upon my bed in sleepless agony all night.
                        When I played in the front dooryard I had a constant dread of a big boy
                            who came from somewhere  around the corner.
                            He would pass back and forth on the sidewalk, just outside the iron
                            fence and challenge me. "If you want to fight, just come out here and
                            I'll lick you!" And he shook his fist and looked very dangerous. "But I
                            don't want to fight," I answered. "Then why don't you say so!" he
                            replied, lifting his head high, and stalked away, filled with conscious
                            pride at his triumph in the art of repartee!
                        As I was a delicate lad and had been kept indoors without physical
                            training, I was at great disadvantage in such fights as were
                            occasionally forced upon me. Frank Fisher, a neighbor boy smaller than
                            I, could generally throw me or knock me down. Even after I went to
                            school I was often the victim of some stronger and sturdier lad "of my
                            own size," though by that time I had come to take my punishment quite
                            stoically. It was not, however, until I went to college that I learned
                            in the "rushes" and melées to take my own part effectually, and began to
                            enjoy, as a boy ought to do, the "rapture of the fight."
                    
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER III
                        FATHER
                        NEXT to mother, father was the most important person
                            in my little world. He was a tall, fine-looking man, about forty years
                            of age as I first remember him, with clean shaven face and a Roman nose.
                            The latter had become a sort of trade-mark in his family. A little way
                            off I could hardly tell his profile from that of Uncle Samuel, his elder
                            brother. Father was a man of commanding presence, he had eyes of grayish
                            blue, an expressive mouth, thick, waving hair and a high broad
                            foreheada forehead that became higher still as the years went
                            by.
                        Father wore 'the plain clothes" of the Quakers, not the drab or gray,
                            indeed, but a black broadcloth, the coat with standing collar from which
                            the front edge curved in graceful outline down to the end of the tail.
                            Certainly father always looked well in his plain clothes, and it may be
                            that under them there was as much pride of personal appearance as in the
                            "gayer" and more profane garments of the world's people.
                        Father at heart was one of the kindest of men, but I have seen him assume
                            a most ferocious appearance when dealing with juvenile offenders, which
                            frightened the little rascals half to death. I  remember one instance in particular. We had a catalpa tree
                            growing on the sidewalk in front of our house, with big leaves and long
                            pods which, when dry, the boys in the neighborhood would use for
                            make-believe cigars, smoking them proudly like grown-up men. They would
                            scramble up the tree box and out upon the limbs, often breaking down the
                            smaller branches, and mutilating the tree. One fellow was very
                            persistent, and though warned to desist, climbed the tree again and
                            again and did considerable damage. One afternoon father spied him up
                            among the branches, went out to the foot of the tree and ordered him
                            down. The boy descended trembling to the sidewalk. There was a frown as
                            black as night on father's countenance while he took the fellow by the
                            shoulders down the front area, through the door, along "the entry" and
                            out into the back yard. The terror on the face of the culprit could not
                            have been greater if he had been passing through that dreadful portal
                            whose inscription bids him that enters abandon every hope. The urchin
                            had a little shaking in the yard and then, howling with fear, was
                            suffered to depart, while father with a hearty laugh remarked to us that
                            he didn't think we would ever be troubled by that boy
                            again. Father very seldom used that frown on me. I knew it too well. He
                            was indeed quite indulgent, relying upon mother (as well as he might) to
                            keep me in the narrow way.
                        Now father, although he had seen much of the  world, had a great deal of childlike simplicity. He had been
                            successful in his business investments, and once he told me in
                            confidence the secret of it: "I buy these bonds," he said one day to me
                            when he was cutting off the coupons, "when they are low; I hold them
                            till they rise in price; then I sell them." How plain it all was!
                        I often wonder now that he was not made the "lamb" of some intriguing
                            speculation and that he ever had anything left. The luck which went with
                            the Roman nose must have stood him in good stead, as it often has his
                            son, but the result he always attributed to his judgment and
                            sagacity.
                        Part of father's simplicity was shown in his unshaken faith in the
                            descriptive power of adjectives, especially those of the superlative
                            degree. Whenever he would describe to us some remarkable work of nature
                            or art which he had seen, he told us that it was "gorgeous, magnificent,
                            superb, tremendous, awe-inspiring, most impressive," etc., these
                            adjectives being considered by him as quite adequate for the
                            understanding of all details.
                        I had, as I already said, an early inclination toward poetry. I made
                            verses before I could write, verses from which great things were
                            predicted, especially by father, who used to act as my amanuensis and
                            take down the "winged words" in which my inspirations were embodied.
                            Among these there were some stanzas to "My Heart," while I was still a
                            very little fellow, which used to give him great  satisfaction, not so much (as I have good reason to think)
                            on account of their artistic merit, as because of the evidence which
                            they gave of the "Light Within" which I had declared to be the source of
                            great enjoyment.
                        An "Ode to Napoleon Bonaparte" met with no such approval, for although
                            the lines did not indicate any intention of fighting either for or
                            against that military hero, but merely the comparatively innocent
                            purpose of going to see him, yet the desire even to visit such a man
                            indicated a tendency which might lead to worse things, so I have reason
                            to believe that the leaf upon which my lines were transcribed was soon
                            afterwards destroyed.
                        Although father was proud of me, yet whenever he spoke of my brother
                            Freddie, who had died, I felt how small I was by the side of such a
                            prodigy. Father would tell me with tears in his eyes of the wise sayings
                            and doings of the child whose dreamy face gazed at me full of tenderness
                            from the shining surface of a daguerreotype that father showed me,
                            holding it while I looked, lest I might let it fall and some harm come
                            to the precious thing.
                        The impression of my brother's countenance upon the plate was a faint
                            one; it might almost have been the copy of his spirit, and I had to hold
                            it at the right angle or else I would see the reflection of things about
                            the room and not the face of the cherished boy.
                        Father told me much of Freddie's last sicknesshow  the little fellow, when he could no longer
                            lie in bed, asked his father to hold him and walk with him back and
                            forth across the room and how he had died thus in his father's arms. I
                            was told that I had been a chubby, good-natured babywhich was
                            well attested by another daguerrotype in which I appeared in a little
                            red plaid dressbut was by no means such a child as Freddie.
                            The lost treasure is ever the most precious to the father's heart.
                        I used to read a good deal, especially in the Bible, about the rich and
                            the poor, and how hard it was for the rich man to go to heaven, and I
                            once asked father whether we were rich or poor. He told me that we were
                            neither the one nor the other, and that we belonged to that middle class
                            which he said was of all in the happiest condition, and he used to
                            repeat to me the solemn prayer whose beauty and wisdom have grown even
                            greater in my eyes after the experiences of a lifetime:
                        
                            "Give me neither poverty nor richesfeed me with food
                                convenient for me,
                            Lest I be full and deny Thee and say: Who is the Lord?
                            Or lest I be poor and steal and take the name of the Lord my
                                God in vain."
                        
                        As father grew older he became even finer looking than he had been
                            before. How well I remember him as he sat "at the head of the meeting"
                            in our plain, yet tasteful, meeting-house. Here at his side and on the
                            seat below, facing the congregation,  sat a
                            number of stately looking men. I have never seen a group of finer faces
                            and figures. There beside father sat Joseph Hatfield, tall, erect and
                            revered, and Jeremiah Fox, kind and benignant, while in the seat below
                            were Joshua Trueblood, whose thick hair, perfectly white, covered a
                            noble forehead and a smooth-shaven ruddy face, and Samuel Braithwaite,
                            an old gentleman of imperial mien and a benevolent yet determined
                            countenance. They sat there in simple gravity, the silence broken only
                            when some one was moved to speakuntil the time came for father
                            and Joseph Hatfield to "shake hands" together and thus break up the
                            meeting. And I can well remember once when two crazy men happened to
                            come to meeting one First Day morningone of them imagining
                            that he was Christ and the other that he was the Holy Ghost, and they
                            each harangued and screamed defiance at each other, but instead of
                            sending for a policeman, father and Joseph Hatfield shook hands and the
                            meeting quietly dispersed.
                        Father was very careful to train me in good, wholesome Quaker traditions.
                            All the stories of the sufferings of early Friends were related to me,
                            the whippings at the cart-tail, the boring of their tongues with red-hot
                            iron, the imprisonments and occasional executions, and their marvelous
                            constancy and non-resistant heroism, as well as the manifestations of
                            Divine Grace toward them, were set forth in glowing colors.
                        
                        There were incidents which seemed to me as wonderful as the Bible
                            miracles, strange enlightenings by the Holy Spirit and prophetic
                            visions, which, according to the account, always turned out true. Father
                            told me of the marvelous doings of George Fox, Robert Barclay and
                            William Penn, and he was much exasperated at Macaulay's strictures upon
                            Penn and his description of the "courtly Quaker" as a "mythical
                            character."
                        We had a big folio volume of Penn's works in our library which had come
                            down to us from my great-grandfather and contained many theological
                            papers"No Cross, No Crown," "The Sandy Fountain Shaken,"
                            "Innocency With Her Open Face," and others. I cannot say that I found
                            these very attractive reading, nor that I could fully understand the
                            arguments about the Trinity, but I was greatly interested in the account
                            of the Trial, where Penn insisted on wearing his hat before the
                            magistrate and was summarily (with monstrous injustice as it seemed to
                            me) trotted off to prison. Penn's Treaty with the Indians I came to
                            regard as perhaps the central event in all history, and once when I read
                            a poem on the Fourth of July, containing the line: 
                                
                                    "This day was won by Washington,"
                                
                             it occurred to me that Penn had been unjustly omitted, and I asked
                            if it was not "won by William Penn, too." Father, I thought, hardly felt
                            how  wrong the omission was when he
                            answered: "Not so much by William Penn," since for my part I couldn't
                            see how William Penn could be behind anybody in anything.
                        Father used to urge upon me the importance of following "Friends'
                            principles" and "testimonies," as he called them, of adhering to
                            "plainness of speech, behavior and apparel"; always to say "thee" and
                            not "you," since the latter was a word introduced in mere compliment,
                            and "First month," "Second month," and not "January" or "February" and
                            "Third day" and "Fourth day," rather than "Tuesday" or 'Wednesday,"
                            since the latter names were those of heathen deities. But father used to
                            teach me astronomy as well as morals and religion, and when he told me
                            about Mercury and Venus and Mars and Jupiter, I asked him if it was not
                            just as wrong to call these planets by the names of heathen gods as it
                            was to say Tuesday and Wednesday. I think father was a little vexed at
                            this question, and although he said it was quite different, I do not
                            remember that he told what the difference was, and when I proposed to
                            call them "First planet," "Second planet," etc., my suggestion was not
                            accepted, so I suppose the distinction was too deep for a boy to
                            comprehend. I think so still.
                        But most of all, father urged upon me the importance of observing what he
                            called the "Fundamental principle of Quakerism," namely, obedience to
                            the "light within," and of following all impressions  of duty, which he said were revelations of
                            the Spirit.
                        So far as impressions of ordinary morality were concerned, I could
                            understand this, but the "light within" sometimes took a wider range. He
                            told me instances where Friends had been directed by it to do things for
                            which there seemed to be no reason. There were revelations to go to a
                            particular meeting and preach upon some particular subject which turned
                            out to be for the salvation of some particular sinner in the flock.
                            There were revelations to open the Bible and the reading of the first
                            passage that met the eye was followed by important results. There were
                            revelations to take particular lines of travel followed by dreadful
                            accidents upon the other road. In fact, the whole world of miracle was
                            set before me as the result of "minding the light."
                        Now I tried many of these things myself, but nothing strange ever
                            happened. The providence which was so constantly directing others seemed
                            to have little care of me. If, "minding the light," I took the second
                            omnibus rather than the one just ahead of it, no accident ever happened
                            to either, so far as I could learnand if I reverently opened
                            the Bible for some special illumination, I most likely came upon the
                            passage, "And Obed begat Jehu and Jehu begat Azariah" or
                            perhaps some battle with the Amalekites, or some instruction about the
                            shew bread which gave me little comfort.
                        Possibly my faith was too weak, for although I assured myself when I took
                            the omnibus or opened  the Bible that I
                            really believed in this miraculous guidance, yet after two or three
                            failures, I remember thinking "I knew it would be so," until at last I
                            became so skeptical that I would trust nothing outside of my own human,
                            mortal, common sense.
                        Then if all the sermons I heard were inspired by the Spirit, I used to
                            wonder why it was that the Spirit didn't understand English grammar any
                            better.
                        There was a little farmer, one Israel Van Cott, from somewhere in Long
                            Island, who used to come to meeting once in a while, and he would jump
                            up three or four times at a single sitting, stringing together each time
                            a number of Bible texts in a sing-song voice, and I wondered why his
                            inspiration didn't come all at once; why he had to give it to us
                            piecemeal. But father would say: "The sermon was not for thee, but
                            perhaps it fitted the condition of some one else who was there."
                        Then there was Amos Higgins with a mouth like a clam, but he didn't have
                            the sense of a clam in keeping it shut. Amos was a carpenter, and once
                            we had him do some work for us. He was so poor that he asked us to pay
                            him in advance, and then when he had got the money, he was so lazy he
                            never finished the job. When Amos got up in meeting and began to preach
                            a sing-song sermon through his nose, I wanted to stick him in the leg
                            with a big pin. I thought it would make the Spirit livelier.  Indeed, I never saw Amos anywhere but I
                            wanted to poke a pin into him and stir him up.
                        Then there was David Jones who used to preach such long sermons that I
                            was glad he didn't always speak at our meeting. He was a good old man,
                            but I always thought him a great goose. For when he was seventy years
                            old he married a second wife who was younger than any of his
                            childrenand remember how bitterly Anna Maria, his daughter,
                            used to talk about his "infatuation" and "the dreadful influence" that
                            woman had over him. Once David told us a story of a call which he had
                            just made upon a friend. "After I took my seat in the parlor," he said,
                            "what should come in but a little terrier that barked at me so fiercely
                            I had to get up on a table and from that to the mantel-piece, where I
                            could stand out of his reach and shake my cane at him until I was
                            relieved." I used to wonder how much of David's life was inspired.
                        Another thing puzzled me still more. If the Spirit was always right how
                            could it lead Friends to take opposite sides of the same question? There
                            was John Borden and Naomi Butterworth, who were "misled," as father used
                            to say. But if the Spirit ever misled anybody, how could you know when
                            it was telling the truth? Once I heard John Borden preach and he said
                            some strange things, I thought, and then Isaac Clear got up afterwards
                            and quoted a text about a blind man who, when he got his sight saw "men
                            as trees walking," and I thought  he meant
                            that this was the way things seemed to John Borden, so I wondered which
                            of them it was that had the inspiration, or how you could tell which
                            inspiration was right.
                        Then there was Abraham Godlove. We children used to argue which was the
                            greater minister, Lucretia Mott or Abraham. Dorcas Jones said Lucretia
                            Mott was greater, but I didn't think so. Lucretia used to preach very
                            quietly just as if she were talking to somebody, and it seemed to me
                            that a really great minister ought to do more than that, he ought to
                            talk loud and high and sing a little. Then Lucretia Mott had always been
                            a very good woman, but Abraham in his early life used to be intemperate.
                            I have heard him pray very earnestly and thank the good Lord that he had
                            been a brand plucked from the burning, and this seemed to me a great
                            deal finer than if he had always been good. The story of the "ninety and
                            nine" had made a deep impression upon my heart. Abraham Godlove used to
                            come to Yearly Meeting quite often. I remember how impressive he looked
                            with his white hair, as he stood at the head of the gallery, and in
                            impassioned words besought us all to follow the same good Master who had
                            been so kind to him. And when at the end of the sermon he told us that
                            his life was drawing to its close and he might never meet us again, and
                            sat down bidding us an affectionate farewell, we all cried, for we were
                            sure that this was his last sermon to us and that he would die  very soon. But next year he came back and
                            once more bade us the same affectionate farewell, and this happened even
                            a third time. And then I didn't cry a bit, for I didn't believe a word
                            of it. It seemed to me he was likely to live forever.
                        At Yearly Meeting our house was full of Friends from the country. There
                            were a few of these who used to smoke, not many, for Friends had "a
                            testimony" against the unnecessary use of tobacco. Whenever any one
                            smoked at our house he had to go out on the back porch or into the back
                            yard, and one dear old friend, Solomon Pennington, would be sent out
                            there alone after dinner, but the little boy of the house used to follow
                            him rather than stay in the parlor with the rest. We had long talks
                            together and it seemed to me that a man might be a nice man even if he
                            smoked.
                        There was a woman Friend who talked to me very seriously on the subject
                            and told me of a young man of her acquaintance who used to chew tobacco.
                            She asked him once how much he used and how much it cost him every week,
                            and then she added it all up and multiplied and calculated and said to
                            him: "By the time thee is fifty years of age thee will have spit away a
                            whole farm!"
                        I had peculiar ideas of the religion of those strange people who were
                            "outside of our Society." One summer when we spent the Fourth of July at
                            the Heath House on Schooley's Mountain (I remember it was the Fourth,
                            for a fire cracker, a "sizzler,"  somehow
                            got underneath the collar of my shirt and "sizzled" there with great
                            deliberation, making a long streak of raw flesh around my neck) I met a
                            little girl with dark-brown eyes, and beautiful wavy hair, who told me
                            in a soft voice that she was a Baptist. The "p" and "t" in that word as
                            uttered by her lips fitted together so melodiously that I felt sure that
                            the Baptist must be a very aristocratic sort of religion.
                        One Christmas day father took me to hear "Pontifical High Mass" at St.
                            Patrick's church in Prince Street, which was then the seat of the
                            Archbishop. I had never before seen anything like the priests in their
                            canonicals, except in Fox's "Book of Martyrs," where men in just such
                            caps and vestments presided over the tortures of the Inquisition, and
                            all through the service I half expected to see some victim brought out
                            and stretched upon the rack or roasted so as to make him confess.
                    
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER IV
                        THE REST OF THE HOUSEHOLD
                        GRANDFATHER THRIVEWELL was a tall,
                            slender, dignified and reserved old man, with strong, sharp features and
                            deep set eyes. He had been a merchant, had amassed considerable
                            property, and owned a number of houses and shops in the lower part of
                            the city, which he had bought near the beginning of the century.
                        He was a very precise and careful man. I remember his exquisite
                            handwritingas fine as steel engravingand the very
                            particular way in which the leases to the tenants had to be drawn up,
                            after models he had prepared. I remember the tenants themselves who used
                            to come up to sign themand after I had learned to write I used
                            to sign my name tooas a witnessand felt the
                            importance of it, watching every stroke of the pen while the others
                            wrote so that I could be sure I had seen all.
                        My grandfather was not present on these occasions. He always stayed in
                            his own room just above the back parlor, where every morning Anne Welsh,
                            the maid, used to bring him a pile of buckwheat cakes for breakfast.
                        I had great awe of grandfather, but once the spirit of mischief was too
                            strong for me. I entered  the room softly
                            and seeing him standing with his back toward me, arrayed in his dressing
                            gown and having upon his head a nightcap that ran up into a point, with
                            a small tassel at the end, I thought I would try to scare him, and so,
                            stealing behind him unobserved, and reaching up as close to his ear as I
                            could get, I shouted at the top of my voice, "Boo!" But when he turned
                            upon me, the horrible expression in his shrunken eyes and open mouth
                            frightened me a great deal more than the noise had frightened him. I
                            flew headlong out of the room and in Katy's arms I sorrowed over my
                            transgression. For two or three days afterwards I felt like a very
                            wicked boy, but at the end of that time grandfather sent me a note,
                            saying: "I forgive little Robert for scaring me," whereupon I ventured
                            back into his room and there was full reconciliation and happiness. But
                            the pointed nightcap with the tassel, which had been so closely
                            associated with that dreadful look, became in my eyes a thing of
                            gruesome and unearthly character.
                        When grandfather died, there is one fact only in connection with that
                            event which stands out clearly in my memory. Just after we had entered
                            the carriage to go to the cemetery, our coachman called out to the
                            undertaker and to the driver of the hearse in front: "I hope yez won't
                            walk all the way," and I said to myself, "I hope not, too."
                        There is another form that comes before mea small, slender,
                            fragile figure and a quiet, gentle, 
                            beautiful face, with light blue eyes. That face is Auntie's
                        Her frail body, which looked as though a stiff breeze would blow it away,
                            was, however, lithe and active. She could walk for miles at a swift pace
                            without fatigue, and I have seen her when over eighty years of age swing
                            herself with the agility of a boy up to the platform of a passing street
                            car without waiting for it to stop. She ate very sparingly, hardly
                            enough for a cat, and had little care what kind of food it was, so long
                            as it was not produced by slave labor.
                        Indeed, her sense of smell as well as of taste was decidedly defective.
                            This relieved her from many annoyances and was not without its
                            advantages in later years to her dear nephew when the boy began to
                            smoke, for, although his room at that time was next to hers, she passed
                            years of blissful unconsciousness that he was acquiring such a bad
                            habit. How much more lovable are those sweet characters who cannot
                            perceive what is going on before their eyes, than the knowing ones with
                            sharp olfactories who are so keenly alive to the sins of those around
                            them!
                        Auntie had once been married, but after a brief period her husband, whom
                            she loved tenderly, had died and she had come back to her father's. She
                            cherished the memory of their few happy days together as the precious
                            recollection of her life. I know of a suitor afterwards who would have
                            been thought by many most desirable, but she wrote a  letter sending him about his business,
                            with the nearest approach to indignation that I ever saw upon her face.
                            For during the many years we were together I never knew her to be angry
                            nor heard her speak unkindly of any one.
                        Her favorite exclamation was "Patience Oh!" Those who do not swear must
                            have some equivalent.
                        Now auntie, I think, loved me almost as dearly as my parents did, for I
                            had been named after her beloved husband. She was not allowed to have
                            much say in the matter of my bringing up, but she took great interest in
                            my literary efforts, especially at the time when I was so small that I
                            had not yet learned to write. I could print a little in great scrawling
                            capital letters and was engaged in the composition of a "geography," but
                            the work of printing went so slowly that Auntie undertook to write the
                            book from my dictation. This was very kind, but unfortunately, after I
                            had grown up and it was all forgotten, she also undertook to have
                            several hundred copies published and circulated among my friends!
                        As a specimen of what the book contained, let us take the following: I
                            had given a definition of a cataract, much the same as that which I had
                            found in my geographiesthen to make it all very vivid and
                            real, I had illustrated my definition with a picture; such a picture as
                            a boy six or seven years old might be expected to draw, and I had
                            further illustrated the picture by the following verse: 
                            
                                
                                    "The cataract falls and makes its roar.
                                    It never stops but still does pour.
                                    It roars and roars for hours and hours.
                                    Yet it keeps on, its water pours."
                                
                             It may be imagined with what pleasure I received, thirty years
                            afterwards, the congratulations of my friends upon this masterpiece!
                        The one remaining member of the family was Uncle Ephraim. Uncle Ephraim
                            was an old bachelor, a small, spare man, with a face already wrinkled by
                            age. Old bachelors, I believe, are often accounted "peculiar," and I
                            recollect that Uncle Ephraim always seemed to me a very "funny man." He
                            was like grandfather in this that he would never see any visitors, and
                            that he spent most of his time in his own room. He took no part in
                            business and little in conversation, and it seemed to me he did nothing
                            but read. Many were the books he used to buy, especially books of
                            travel.
                        Auntie was the one member of the family who was closest to him. She
                            looked very carefully after his comfort and watched over him with
                            affectionate guardianship. When she afterwards bought a cottage by the
                            seaside, where we spent our summers for many years, the best room down
                            stairs, right in the middle of the house, was set apart for Uncle
                            Ephraim, and we had to go around it out of doors in passing from the
                            parlor to the dining room. While we lived there, he and I used to take
                            long walks through the country together, and he had a  very perverse habit of wanting to go one
                            way when I wanted to go another. Then we would separate, but after
                            crossing two or three fields a little way apart, we always came together
                            at last and went home in company.
                        Uncle Ephraim, too, was very fond of me. When on Christmas morning I
                            rummaged in my stocking or ran down to the basement to see what presents
                            I had (for the fiction of Santa Claus, like all other fictions, was
                            banished from our sober household), it was always Uncle Ephraim's gift
                            that shone most resplendent in the collection. It was he who had given
                            me the two great books on Natural History, one of which contained the
                            picture of the hippopotamus. But one Christmas I had a dreadful
                            experience! Looking on the table I spied, among other things, a square
                            box with a hook in front as if to keep down the top. "See, I've brought
                            him a whole box of things this time." (Uncle Ephraim always spoke to me as well as of me in the third
                            person. If the third person was used without any further explanation,
                            that always meant the small boy of the household.) So I opened the box
                            and up sprang a terrible ferocious figure with thick beard and monstrous
                            mustache, and I ran back to the kitchen and sought safety in Katy's
                            arms.
                        But like that other "monster of such frightful mien" this jack-in-the-box
                            at last became very precious to me, for it was the means of my awakening
                                 in my small companions the same
                            terrors that it had first aroused in me.
                        One day little Mary Fisher came to play with me and having been
                            introduced to Black-beard in the same way in which I had myself made
                            that gentleman's acquaintance, she became so alarmed that she could not
                            endure the picture of a man anywhere, and she even covered up with her
                            mashed potatoes the figures of the little brown men on her dinner plate,
                            so that they could not look at her.
                        The other inmates of our household were the nurse and the chambermaid,
                            Anne Lynch and Anne Welsh (who sometimes seemed to me like East and West
                            upon the map), and Katy, the cook, who stood for the broiling South. Her
                            last name was Coffey. She was a faithful soul and lived with us many,
                            many years. She spoke a wild Irish brogue that was quite
                            incomprehensible until you became used to it. She was a devout Catholic
                            and told me that the Pope was the mightiest of all kings and had the
                            largest army in the world. Her husband, before she came from Ireland,
                            had been transported to Australia for some offense of which he was
                            entirely innocent, but he had been led into it by wicked men!
                        Katy could not read or write a word, she was homelier than a stone fence
                            and yet I think that if our places in the great hereafter are to be
                            graded according to the faithful performance of duty, few of us will
                            stand so near the throne. She served us with industry, affection,
                            cheerfulness and absolute  honesty.
                            Whatever may be said of the shortcomings of domestic servants, it has
                            always seemed to me that their integrity is remarkable. Heaven knows
                            they have temptations enough! Money, precious jewels and other valuable
                            property are spread constantly before their eyes with unlimited
                            facilities for theft, and yet so little is ever missing!
                        When we consider the dishonesty in trade, in politics, in medicine, in
                            law, in religion itself, I doubt whether the higher grades of social
                            life will average half so well.
                        Anne Lynch was accurately described in a letter written long afterwards
                            by one of her subsequent employers in answer to an inquiry as to her
                            character and capabilities. "She is conceited, garrulous, impertinent,
                            and has the voice of a hyena. If you don't mind these things she is in
                            every other respect absolutely perfect."
                        Anne Welsh I remember with both elbows on the table holding in her hands
                            close to her eyes the tea cup she had just drained, and solemnly seeking
                            to unravel her future destiny from the grounds at the bottom, an art
                            into which I was duly initiated and which I have always considered quite
                            as accurate a mode of telling fortunes as palmistry or the contemplation
                            of the stars.
                    
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER V
                        OUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS
                        NEXT door to us, in the house whose "stoop" adjoined
                            our own, lived Mark Underwood, with his wife Eliza (who once had "the
                            influenza," a strange disease somewhat different from the croup) and
                            their son, George, a boy a few years older than myself, who was for a
                            long time my model, mentor and guide, such a one as every boy must
                            havethough mother used to say that he imposed upon me. Mark
                            Underwood was a "horticulturist" and had a country place. In his back
                            yard, right against our fence, grew a big peach tree, named by the
                            Horticultural Society "The Underwood Seedling," and I often used to
                            wonder whether the peaches that hung over on our side did not belong to
                            us.
                        Just across the way lived Mrs. Hood, a widow. Mrs. Hood was very rich.
                            She owned a large meat packing establishment in Division Street. Some
                            said she was worth half a miliion! Yet she continued to keep a stall
                            down in Fulton Market, whither she went every morning. Her portly person
                            was covered with a plain shawl, an old fashioned bonnet was on her head
                            and a basket always on her arm, as she waddled up the steps and rang the
                            bell of her front door on her return. Why on earth  did Mrs. Hood keep that stall, spending her time among the
                            fishwomen, when she had more than money enough to keep her in comfort
                            all her days? That was the great riddle of the neighborhood.
                        On the west side of Mrs. Hood's house lived Mr. Higgins and his wife. Mr.
                            Higgins sometimes used to come staggering home, and he was pointed out
                            to me when in this state as a dreadful warning. After a while Mrs.
                            Higgins died and we were all shocked to see her husband tipsy the day
                            after she passed away. Ah, what a wretch he was! No doubt he had brought
                            her to her death-bed! But Auntie said in a quiet, sympathetic voice:
                            "Poor man! He is trying to drown his sorrow!" And she added she did not
                            blame those who drank nearly so much as those who sold them the
                            liquor.
                        It was mostly in front of Mr. Higgins' house that the organ man used to
                            play. There were many organ grinders who frequented the streets, but one
                            was persistent and we knew his tunes only too well. Whether Higgins
                            encouraged him to come for the purpose of drowning his sorrow or
                            exalting his joy, I know not, but it is certain that the tunes did
                            neither, so far as the neighbors were concerned. Once when I was ill,
                            the diabolical noises produced by that organ grinder set me wild and
                            father was constrained to purchase his silence at a higher price that
                            his music had ever brought.
                        But to me the most important house in that neighborhood was the one next
                            to ours on the other  side from the
                            Underwood's, for in that dwelt the Carlisles, and there lived Maggie.
                            Maggie was a black-eyed little witch. I do not remember that I ever
                            visited her or that she ever came to see me. Our acquaintance was
                            altogether across a high board fence, more impenetrable than the wall
                            that parted Pyramus and Thisbe, for in it was no chink nor knot-hole.
                            Maggie would stand on her back porch and I would talk to her from the
                            yard. Or sometimes I would climb the grape arbor and look down on her
                            over the fence and we would have long conversations. It was on one of
                            these occasions that she told me she had been to the circus. I had never
                            seen anything more than a menagerie, and the glories of a circus as she
                            described them dazzled my imagination. Maggie and I often had quarrels
                            with vows that we would never speak again, but these were followed by
                            sweet reconciliations or perhaps by my loud calls over the fence, in
                            total forgetfulness that there had been a feud the day before. I often
                            fancied myself performing some act of heroism for Maggie, rescuing her
                            from a burning building or a sinking ship. I had seen in Greenwood
                            Cemetery the statue of a brave fireman who had perished while saving an
                            infant from the flames, and I resolved to imitate him. In fancy, through
                            the dark night, I could see the great flames leaping from the windows of
                            Maggie's house; I could see the red-shirted firemen working vainly at
                            the engines to extinguish the conflagration; I could see the multitude
                                 looking up in breathless awe. Then a
                            cry announced that Maggie (who was sleeping in the front room on the
                            third floor) had been forgotten. Yet no one dared to stir to rescue her.
                            Suddenly I leaped forth from the throng, quickly mounted the ladder
                            which was placed against the window of her room, entered amid smoke and
                            flames, seized her and carried her down in my arms, amid the plaudits of
                            the multitude. I did not, however, perish in the falling building. I
                            preferred to live a little longer and enjoy the glory of my triumph, as
                            well as Maggie's gratitude.
                        But fate was cruel and gave me no chance to rescue her, so I was a hero
                            only in imagination. How many such heroes there are! Did you ever read
                            Sienkiewicz's novel, "With Fire and Sword"? If so, you will remember Pan
                            Longin Podbipienta, one of whose ancestors had cut off three Turks'
                            heads at a stroke, and who had made a vow never to look upon woman with
                            the eyes of love till he had done the like. Now Pan Longin was a sturdy
                            fellow and very brave. He lacked nothing for the performance of his vow
                            except the concurrence of three Turks' heads in the precise position
                            where they could all be stricken off at a single blow. One Turk's head
                            was an easy matter and so would three have been if he could only find
                            them in one place. That is the way it is all through our lives. There is
                            much potential heroism and greatness in our makeup, but the three Turks'
                            heads come not often together.  So Maggie
                            was never rescued. Perhaps that was just as well, for thus she avoided
                            all anxiety, and the house as well as the furniture were saved by the
                            failure of my opportunity!
                        There was another neighbor who played an important part in my life, and
                            that was Auntie Dane, a fat old woman, who kept a toy and candy shop
                            around the corner. She sold ice-cream, wholesale and
                            retailthat is, a big plate for grown-up people, which cost a
                            dimeor, on the other hand, an egg cup, scant measure for a
                            cent, or heaping full for two cents. Often I would regale myself with a
                            two-cent portion and then go home and complete my joy in the grape arbor
                            with great bunches of Isabellas!
                        We used to have some friends from the country who would come to visit us
                            in the winter time, and then in summer we would visit them. Among others
                            were Luke and Evalina Stone from Westfield. Luke was a red-faced, burly
                            man, and he was very strong. I know this because mother once told me
                            that he was stronger even than father, and I had found out from romping
                            with father on the floor, how desperately strong he
                            was. I knew well the story of Samson in the Bible, and one day when one
                            of my little friends came to see me I proposed a new game. He was to be
                            Samson, the strongest man in the world (in ancient times) and I was to
                            be Luke Stone, the strongest man in Westfield (at a later and more
                            advanced period), and we were thus  to
                            contend for the mastery. So the past and the present wrestled together
                            and pounded each other over the head for a long while, but I cannot
                            remember whether the outcome showed the progress or degeneration of
                            mankind.
                        Among the most frequent visitors at our house was Henrietta Simpson.
                            Henrietta weighed about two hundred and fifty pounds and she was, as
                            mother said, "a great talker." Her thoughts poured forth in a smooth,
                            solid stream without pause or interruption for hours. Her husband, Simon
                            Simpson, was very hard of hearing, but I used to wonder whether this was
                            really an affliction. He always carried an ear-trumpet, and when
                            Henrietta would signal to him that she wanted to say something, he would
                            put it to his ear and listen patiently for awhile, but when at last he
                            became too tired, he would take it out and lay it gently on his lap. He
                            thus seemed to be more the master of his fate than if he could have
                            heard without it.
                    
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER VI
                        MY OCCUPATIONS
                        I RECALL many of the occupations in which I passed the
                            long and often solitary hours of my childhood. I whittled small boats of
                            various designs, boats with flat bottoms and boats with deep keels,
                            long, narrow boats and chubby flat fellows, sloops, schooners, brigs,
                            ships and catamarans. I had great plans for inventions. I made kites of
                            strange forms and many tails and peculiar modes of operation, which
                            generally wouldn't rise, and I would ruminate schemes for flying
                            machines and for perpetual motion which I would never believe to be quite impossible, even though the books did say it
                            was. Mother used to encourage this spirit of invention. One day she took
                            me to Fowler, the phrenologist, who examined my head and told me that I
                            would take out patents before I was twenty-one. The bump of
                            "constructiveness" was marked seven, or "very large" on the chart, which
                            meant that I would "show extraordinary mechanical ingenuity and a
                            perfect passion for making everything." But alas! my energies were
                            turned into other channels, the promise of youth was blighted and now I
                            cannot wrap a package or drive a nail.
                        But another quality, "veneration" or religious  feeling, was quite small. Fowler marked it only three, and
                            when I used to feel for the "bump" with my hands, I thought it was
                            rather a depression. Perhaps this accounted for my doubts concerning
                            "inspiration" and my failure to see those special acts of Providence
                            which intervened so marvelously in the affairs of others. I was much
                            concerned at this defect in my make-up, especially since Fowler's book
                            said that "veneration" was one of the qualities which could not be
                            cultivated too much and gave sundry sage instructions for its
                            development.
                        There is something very satisfactory in having a man's brain mapped out
                            and his character described with geographical precision, as if his head
                            were like the greater globe and his qualities like the continents and
                            countries upon its surface; hence phrenology for a long time won more
                            favor than it ever deserved. It is safe to say that an accurate
                            "topographical survey" of the brain has not yet been made, that Fowler's
                            charts were hardly better than the old maps of Ptolemy or Strabo, and
                            not reliable for purposes of biographical navigation.
                        My life in the city, though it filled eleven out of the twelve months in
                            the year, contained hardly half of the raptures and heart-throbs that
                            made up my real existence. The month of August, father's vacation, was
                            always spent in the country, at Uncle Samuel's farm. Here there were
                            sources of infinite amusement for the city boy. What a joy to milk the
                            cows or to go forth into the farmyard with an ear  of corn and scattering the grains upon the ground to watch
                            the chickens rush headlong from all directions to be first at the feast!
                            What grandeur to walk along the pike with "Tag," the big Newfoundland,
                            as an advance guard, wagging his bushy tail in measured cadences! How
                            springy was the hay in the great mow as I jumped up and down and then
                            flung myself upon it with no fear of falling. And then my play-house
                            under the great chestnut tree! Many would never call this a house at
                            all, for it had neither walls nor roof. It was nothing but a "ground
                            plan," as an architect would say; there were little rows of stones to
                            show which was the hall and the parlor and the dining-room and kitchen,
                            and perhaps one or two bedrooms on the first floor. The walls and
                            ceiling and furniture and windows were all left to imagination, but poor
                            indeed must be fancy of a boy if he could not see just the kind of a
                            house he liked in those little rows of stones. Best of all, it could be
                            torn down and built in a few minutes, according to his taste, and there
                            are few palaces even (unless it be Aladdin's) that have any such
                            advantage as that.
                        Uncle Samuel's house was an old-fashioned one of rough stone,
                            "splatterdashed" with fine pebbles on the outside. It was set back a
                            little from the pike and faced sideways, as it seemed to me, for the
                            front was toward the drive, the gable at the end being next to the
                            road.
                        It was a long, narrow house with a wide "piazza" running the full length
                            in front (I well knew the  difference
                            between a "piazza" and a "porch," which was merely a short square thing
                            just in front of the front door, such as they had at Uncle Gamaliel's
                            and not long and broad like a "piazza"). There were three front doors
                            opening upon this "piazza." The one farthest away from the pike led to
                            the kitchen, where Grandmother Dillingham used secretly to give me cakes
                            and jelly "between meals." The door nearest the pike led to the parlor,
                            a dark silent room rarely opened except upon great occasions, when there
                            was company. In this room was a picture of "The Peaceable Kingdom,"
                            painted by Friend Bartholomew East, which was a great wonder to me. Not
                            only the lion and the lamb, but a whole Noah's Ark collection of animals
                            were living together in great contentment with a little child in the
                            midst of them. The perspective was peculiar and there were some animals
                            I did not recognize, but what of that? There might well be such animals
                            in Paradise! The middle door on the "piazza" led to the sitting-room,
                            where there was a big clock on a shelf with a round, merry face to
                            welcome you as you entered and a loud, comfortable "tick" to make you
                            feel at home. From the sitting-room an inclosed stairway led upstairs,
                            and in a closet under the steps was a collection of grandfather's canes.
                            He had many kindscanes light and dark, canes smooth and
                            gnarled, canes with round, curling tops, and canes with ivory handles,
                            and every one had its history.
                    
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER VII
                        GRANDFATHER DILLINGHAM AND UNCLE BENJAMIN
                        BUT from grandfather's canes I must pass on to
                            Grandfather Dillingham himself. He was a hale old man of more than
                            seventy years with an ample "bay-window" under his long drab waistcoat,
                            for he loved the good thing of earth, and the careful housewives who
                            entertained him when he "traveled in the work of the ministry" would
                            always put the best they had on the table when "Joseph Dillingham" was
                            there to dine or sup. He had a round head and a moon-like face, always
                            clean shaven, and he could shave in less time than anyone else in the
                            world. Once another Friend bantered him into a race. The razors were
                            stropped, the lather was put on, the word of command was given: "Shave!"
                            and at it they went. Grandfather soon distanced his competitor, and in
                            about half a minute the victory was won!
                        Grandfather had formerly managed the farm upon which the homestead stood,
                            but he had now given it to Uncle Samuel in consideration of a small
                            annuity, and he devoted his remaining years to his work as a minister of
                            the Society of Friends. The Quakers, as is well known, had a "testimony
                            against a hireling ministry," a testimony which owed its  origin to the corruption of the
                            Established Church at the time of the foundation of Quakerism. The
                            Gospel, they held, should be freely given to all "without money and
                            without price," so their ministers were not paid, nor even reimbursed
                            for their expenses in traveling to the meetings which they "had a
                            concern" to visit. It is said that Elias Hicks used to sell a small
                            slice of his farm when he wanted to make an extended tour. But
                            Grandfather's needs were not great and his annuity enabled him to visit
                            Friends in various parts of the country and give them such messages as
                            he believed had been intrusted to him by his Divine Master. I often
                            heard him preach at the old meeting house in the neighborhood. He was
                            especially fond of the writings of the Apostle Paul and would frequently
                            take his texts from the Epistles. He began his sermons in a quiet,
                            conversational tone, but as he warmed up with his subject, he would fall
                            into that half musical intonation which used to be common among the
                            preachers of the societyan intonation not unlike the chant of
                            the priests in the Catholic Church. When he had finished one part of his
                            discourse, he would begin again, slowly and quietly as before, and again
                            fall into a sing-song as he progressed. Once, after grandfather had got
                            into the full swing of his exhortation, a little boy on one of the
                            benches before him, nudged his father, at whose side he sat, and
                            whispered: "Papa! Papa! Now it goes nice!"
                        
                        But grandfather was not only a minister, he was a mathematician and
                            astronomer, and used to make the calculations for Friends' Almanac. So
                            much interested was he in the performances of the heavenly bodies, that
                            once upon the occasion of a week-day meeting, when an eclipse of the sun
                            was to take place, he made his sermon very short and "shook hands" with
                            the Friend next to him ten or fifteen minutes before the usual time;
                            then rushing to the wagon-shed, he took out his horse and drove like mad
                            back to his home where his burned glasses and his telescope were
                            awaiting him, in time to make his observations just as the moon entered
                            the sun's disc. There were three brass nails in the "piazza" which
                            marked the meridian, and by which he used to correct his watch. For
                            grandfather's watch was always kept in excellent discipline and was
                            never suffered to get more than a few seconds out of the way. Once he
                            made us a wonderful sun-dial, a dial with five facesone
                            horizontal on top, one on the south side, which was serviceable most of
                            the time, one on the east for the morning, one on the west for
                            afternoon, and one on the north, which could be used for a few hours,
                            early and late, during the long summer days. There were also tables upon
                            this dial to correct the sun time for each day of the year, and around
                            the face of the dial, at the top, the appropriate motto: Non numero horas nisi serenas "I count not the hours
                            unless they are clear."
                        
                        Grandfather was always a welcome guest at the houses he visited. He was a
                            genial soul and had a vast fund of anecdotes, which always drew around
                            him a circle of listeners. His stories were generally about Friends and
                            their experiences, the wonderful revelations made to them, and the odd
                            ways of many of the ministers. He used to tell what I considered a very
                            funny story of Stephen Grellet, a Frenchman, who had been "convinced" of
                            Friends' principles. (Why was it, I wondered, that the stories were
                            always of those who had been converted to Quakerism
                            and never of those who had been led away?) Stpehen once astonished his
                            auditors by beginning a sermon with the following text: "Ye mountains,
                            why do ye skip like rams and ye hills like ze little moutons!"
                        Grandfather would also tell of James Simpson who was "filled with the
                            power of the Spirit," but who could never preach if anything went wrong.
                            Once James held an oppointed meeting in a barn. He had given special
                            directions that all fowls and other living creatures should be carefully
                            excluded, but just as he was rising to deliver his message, an old hen
                            that had been laying unperceived in a corner of the haymow, flew down
                            among the audience with great cackling and uproar. Poor James was sadly
                            discomfited. "I told thee to keep the hens away," he cried to the
                            astonished proprietor of the barn, and he announced to those who had
                            gathered to hear him that they might go home, that the meeting  was all over. But they remained, and after
                            everything had again become quiet, James rose a second time "and
                            preached," said grandfather, "with greater power than ever before."
                        Grandfather often "had a concern" (to use phraseology of the Quakers) to
                            visit various prisons, and adddress words of comfort and encouragement
                            to the prisoners. They evidently made game of his sympathetic heart, for
                            after a visit of this kind he always came back with an assortment of
                            stories of guiltless men convicted upon false testimony, the victims of
                            peculiar combinations of circumstances, which unjustly cast upon them
                            the imputation of crimes committed by others. After giving an incredible
                            account of some marvelous perversion of justice which he had just heard
                            from the lips of one of these innocents, he would add: "I do believe
                            that poor man's story from the bottom of my heart?" Dear grandfather,
                            with his simple faith! When at last he lay on his death-bed racked with
                            pain, he heard the songs of the angels around his pillow, and said, in
                            the words of his beloved apostle: "I have fought the good fight, I have
                            finished my course, and henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of
                            righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, shall give me in
                            those days, and not to me only, but to all such as love His
                            appearing."
                        Uncle Samuel and Aunt Martha were both very good to me. Uncle Samuel
                            taught me to ride  "Dandy" up the drive,
                            though he would not let the horse go any faster than a walk. "Martin and
                            Dandy" were the two "best" horses. Martin was the best of all, and great
                            were the feats of intelligence attributed to him. Dandy was a light bay,
                            better looking perhaps, but the farm hand (who had picked up a few big
                            words at school) used to say, he was "not so intellectual a horse" as
                            Martin.
                        On the other side of the pike from Uncle Samuel's and a good way back
                            from the road, lived Uncle Benjamin, grandfather's brother, a tall old
                            gentleman, with a fine face, but very feeble. He had, as it seemed to
                            me, even a better collection of anecdotes than grandfather, for his
                            stories were not about Friends, but about green Irishmen who came to
                            work upon his farm. One of these named Timothy, who must have hailed
                            from some very verdant quarter of the "old country," was greatly
                            perplexed on account of a tall clock in the room where he was to sleep.
                            It was quite dark and the great figure against the wall with its
                            menacing tick, tick, filled him with alarm. At last the clock struck
                            ten. The poor fellow could stand it no longer, but rushing off in great
                            consternation, he cried: "Faith, Misther Benjamin (for thus it was that
                            my uncle had directed the "help" to address him), there's a man in me
                            room that hez fired at me tin times and now he's peckin' his flint to
                            fire again!"
                        One day there were a number of Quarterly Meeting Friends staying at the
                            house, and when the time  came to harness
                            their horses, Uncle Benjamin asked him on which side he was going to put
                            the gray horse to a certain carriage. Timothy had entirely forgotten how
                            they had been harnessed when they came, so he scratched his head and
                            answered with a twinkle of his eye: "Sure I belave the gray goes on the
                            south side whin the stern is next to the wind."
                        Dennis, another Irishman, was very proud of his skill in breaking horses.
                            There was a narrow lane leading from Uncle Benjamin's out to the pike
                            and just at the gate were some bushes. Now Dennis had a boy, a lubberly
                            fellow named Mike, whom he directed to stand behind the bushes and cry
                            out at the passing of a colt which he was breaking, so that the animal
                            might become used to sudden noises. As Dennis drove by, the boy rushed
                            forth and yelled at the top of his voice: "Boo!" whereupon the colt ran
                            away, upset the old man and broke his leg. He was brought into the house
                            and put to bed, and Mike came into the room and tearfully begged
                            forgiveness. "Ah, Mike," said the father in discouraged tones, "I always
                            knew ye were a fule, but I never knew ye were such a damned fule to make
                            such a big boo!"
                        
                        But there were other things I learned at Uncle Benjamin's besides these
                            beautiful stories. David, the farm hand, showed me how to make an Indian
                            whistle. First you took a piece of flexible wood, rather broad; you
                            bored a hole in the end and fastened it by a string to a straight stick
                            which you held  in your hand, and when you
                            whirled the first piece round and round as fast as you could, it gave
                            forth a dull, buzzing sound, much like a swarm of bees, and David said
                            the noise could be heard more than a mile away! But Uncle Benjamin had a
                            hive of real bees not far from the house and once when I was whirling my
                            whistle and wondering how so low a sound could be heard so far, the
                            bees, aroused by the competition, came forth, the buzzing for an instant
                            became louder than ever, then a sharp pain followed, and there was vocal
                            music after the instrumental, while I ran into the house and grandmother
                            bathed my face in cream.
                    
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER VIII
                        OUR SUMMER HOME
                        ONE spring Auntie made a visit to the seashore, and
                            while she was there she took a fancy to a house upon a hillside, where
                            there was a fine view, and before she came home she had purchased it,
                            and told us we were all to live there with her during the summer. The
                            carpenter was soon at work upon a new addition, and before the Fourth of
                            July (that most dreadful of days in the metropolis to the quiet heart of
                            the Quaker) all was in readiness. When the time came for us to go I was
                            nearly beside myself for joy and when it was decided for some trifling
                            reason to put off our departure for another day, I wept so bitterly that
                            the family, overcome by the greatness of my affliction, set off, bag and
                            baggage, immediately.
                        That same evening we reached the cottage and although everything in the
                            house was topsy turvy, it seemed to me a veritable paradise. Next
                            morning when I arose and went out of doors to the summer house at the
                            top of the hill, I found that the landscape whose charms had attracted
                            Auntie's fancy was indeed very beautiful. To the east and south was a
                            long stretch of ocean beyond a wide expanse of fertile fields. To the
                            north, far in the distance,  rose the blue
                            mountains (for such they seemed at the time of life when all things are
                            loftiest and fairest), a little nearer was a range of lower and greener
                            hills, and nearer still, winding in a snakelike course through the wide
                            plain, glistened one of the forks of an inlet of the sea that branched
                            out into many arms like the tentacles of a cuttlefish, enclosing
                            peninsulas of fine farming country, dotted with comfortable mansions.
                            One of these branches came up in a narrow creek almost to the foot of
                            our hill where it was lost in great masses of cat-tails, that grew so
                            thick upon its edges that they seemed to stifle it. The plain was
                            checkered with many-colored fields, here a pasture, there plowed land,
                            next a cornfield, then a patch of woodland, the whole besprinkled with
                            houses and other farm buildings, and one or two small hamlets. Back of
                            our hill was the village, which we used to call "the Pole," from the big
                            flagstaff at the post-office where four roads met, and from among the
                            trees rose the pretty white spire of the old church, which has long
                            since disappeared. At that time no screaming of locomotives nor rattle
                            of trains interrupted the quiet of the place, but once a day the Highland Belle or the Ocean Storm
                            steamed down from the metropolis, a trip which was always made at high
                            tidethe hour of departure changing every day. Often the boat
                            would run aground especially off "Jumpin' Pint," as it was called by the
                            fishermen in the neighborhood, and sometimes it had to be pushed off by
                            long poles.
                        
                        We could see the boat with a blue rim upon its paddle box as it passed up
                            the river, and at places where the banks were so high that they
                            concealed the stream, the steamer looked as though it were moving across
                            the fields, and the foam thrown up by the wheels seemed as if it were
                            earth which they plowed as they passed over it, though we could plainly
                            hear the intermittent throbbing sound on the quiet waters as the steamer
                            came up to the dock on a still summer evening.
                        The place is greatly changed now, and the quiet village has grown into a
                            big, bustling, uninteresting town, a noisy, untidy place, where every
                            few minutes long trains of cars, with their attendant smoke and dust,
                            come rattling past, and where you can no longer see the landscape on
                            account of the things which conceal and deface it. Even the trees that
                            have grown around the unsightly structures add little to the attractions
                            of the scene. There were not so many of them when I was a boy, and those
                            nearest the sea were cedars, old, rugged, hardy, stunted fellows with
                            their branches bent landward by the winter storms, looking as if they
                            had indignantly turned their backs upon the offending ocean. The
                            fish-hawks, too, who used to build their huge nests in the dead and
                            dying branches and bring home to their brood the fish that glittered and
                            struggled in their talonsthese have also in a measure
                            disappeared, finding the advent of so much noise and smoke and
                            civilization uncongenial. The last time  I
                            visited these scenes and saw the old charm of the landscape fallen into
                            ruin, I would have turned heart-sick away were it not for a single
                            consolation that remained to me. Thank God that sunsets never change;
                            or, rather, that in all their infinite changes their beauty grows no
                            less from year to year! The sunset that I saw that evening was as
                            glorious as any my childhood ever looked upon. Away in the depths of the
                            clouds that rolled around it like luminous moving mountains of gold and
                            crystal, the great fiery ball stood for a while close to the edge of the
                            hills beyond the woodland and then went down on the other side. And what
                            a glory was left behind! Mountains and domes and palaces and soft beds
                            of golden down, where one might be at rest and dream forever! Have you
                            never wished that you could glide upon the wings of an eagle down that
                            long, shining pathway toward the west and there recline awhile in the
                            recesses of a sunset cloud? If not, the glories of Paradise are not for
                            you.
                        But I must bring you from the clouds back to Auntie's cottage and I must
                            first tell you of the dumb animals about the place, for to my thinking
                            at that time they were the most important things. First there was the
                            rooster and his eight hens. And such hens! They used to lay seven eggs a
                            day, and sometimes eight, and one of them was so tame you could never
                            make her get out of the way, but she would stand in the walk in front of
                            you, cock her  head on one side and stare
                            at you as much as to say: "What are you going to do about it?" And there
                            she would stay until you almost tumbled over her. She liked to eat out
                            of your hand, and you could stroke her along her neck and across her
                            back down to her very tail. Then there was Prince, the dog, who came to
                            stay with us each summer, and found other less desirable quarters, I
                            don't know where, during the remaining nine months of the year. Prince
                            was an "E Pluribus Unum" dog; that is, he was a great
                            many kinds of a dog all in one. He had a long, big, round body, and very
                            short legs with toes that turned out. He had coarse, grizzly hair, part
                            yellow and part dirty white, and it tumbled around his eyes in a
                            confused way, giving him a misanthropic look, which was justified by his
                            behavior. If you stroked his back you could feel many irregularities,
                            some of these were burrs which had become buried under his thick mat of
                            hair, but most of them were bird-shot buried in his skin, shot which had
                            been deposited there by those who had had scores to settle with him, in
                            vain efforts to put him out of the world. Prince was desperately fond of
                            Auntie, whom he welcomed with the maddest demonstrations of joy and whom
                            he followed everywhere upon her walks, snapping at everybody, right and
                            left, and dodging the stones hurled at him from every quarter. His
                            instinct toward depravity was unerring. The boys who stole our
                            watermelons were never molested, but our friends were all bitten  in due form immediately upon their
                            arrival. Many was the time he kept us awake all night barking and
                            howling at nobody. At last I set about the task of making things as
                            interesting to him as he made them to others, with the hope that he
                            might be induced to leave us, for Auntie would not turn him away. I
                            pitched him into the cistern at the barn and rescued him only after I
                            though he had been frightened almost to death, but although he scampered
                            off for an hour or two, he was back in time for supper, full of
                            affection for Auntie and forgiveness for myself. That dog must have had
                            a hundred lives. He was old when he first came to us, and he grew to be
                            a canine Methusaleh before we missed him upon our annual return.
                        When we first moved to our country house we used to hire Watson's horse.
                            But it was not long until we bought Terry, and then father built a barn
                            for him. Terry was a rather scraggy looking gray beast with an honest,
                            though not comely Roman nose, which seemed appropriate in our family,
                            but his sterling qualities developed later and he was found to be swift,
                            strong and gentle, a horse either for the carriage or the saddle. I was
                            very fond of him and for several years I used to take care of him and
                            rode him almost every day. As I grew bigger and bolder, I would try
                            experiments. Sometimes I would jump on his back and ride him without
                            saddle or bridle. Once when I did this he started towards a small cherry
                            tree with a branch  jsut high enough from
                            the ground to brush me off, and I suddenly found myself sitting on the
                            grassplat close to the veranda, while Terry disappeared down the front
                            lawn. Later still I used to jump fences and ride circus-fashion,
                            standing on his back. The first time I tried this I had a striking
                            illustration of the fickleness of fortune. I had made very careful
                            preparations. I had put most of the saddle-cloth back of the saddle so
                            that there would be a good place to stand. I had taken off my shoes so
                            that I could not slip, and letting Terry walk slowly, I first rose to my
                            knees and then stood crouching very low upon his back in most unstable
                            equilibrium. But gradually I got used to it. I lifted my head higher and
                            finally stood upright upon Terry's back and felt very grand. Bogert's
                            boys were in the adjoining lot gazing at me with wonder and admiration.
                            This spurred me to further endeavors. I made Terry pace a little and
                            still stood upright upon his back. But even this did not satisfy me, so
                            I gave him a cut with the whip to make him gallop. The result was not
                            what I expected. As I was behind the saddle he tossed me a few inches in
                            the air at each bound and I went across the fieldjump, jump,
                            jump, till we came to the fence. There Terry stopped, but I couldn't
                            stop. I went over his neck, and over the fence and landed on my head in
                            Israel Hodgin's field. Then Bogert's boys, who had been all awe and
                            envy, set up a shout of derision  and I
                            crawled back and hobbled home, crestfallen and embittered at the
                            world.
                        I must not forget to tell you of Bunny, a big, white, pink-eyed rabbit,
                            who used to jump up and lick my face when I tried to take a nap upon the
                            lounge. After three or four tastes he would give me a small bite, as if
                            to say, "the sample is satisfactory, let me have a piece." The strangest
                            thing about Bunny were his two big ears, so transparent that you could
                            see each pulsation of the blood as it coursed through the dark little
                            channels that looked for all the world like the Mississippi River and
                            its tributaries as they appeared upon my map of North America!
                    
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER IX
                        MY COMPANIONS AND ACQUAINTANCES
                        YOUR boy is your true democrat. Rank and station count
                            for little with him so long as he can find a comrade who will tell him
                            something he wants to know, or help him do something he wants done.
                        In a small cottage, a little way down the main road, lived "Old Conk," an
                            ancient fisherman with grizzly beard, who always went barefoot, and one
                            of his great toes turned over the smaller ones in a most interesting
                            way. I used to wonder whether his name did not come from that of the
                            shells which were always vocal with the sound of the great sea on which
                            the old man made his living. Among the boys of the neighborhood he was
                            rated as a dangerous character. He was liable to come out and shake you
                            or beat you almost any time! He had a grandson, a barefooted little
                            scamp, who for a while was my constant companion and staunchest friend.
                            From him I acquired much of my nautical knowledge and also certain
                            linguistic attainments. I had already been taught by Georgie Underwood a
                            number of dialectic variations of that great boy-language known as "Hog
                            Latin." For example, if you wanted to say, "I will not do that," you
                            might say it in several ways. You might put a letter "g"  in the middle of each syllable and say,
                            "Igi wigill nogot dogoo thagat," or you might add a uniform termination
                            to each "Igary wiggary noggary doogary thagary," or "Ivisa
                            wivisa novisa dovisa thavisa." This was very useful for those who wished
                            to communicate in secret so that no one else could ever understand! But
                            Pete Conk added a new tongue "Italian," he called it, and said
                            it was a real language, and that people spoke it in some country far
                            away. Its main feature was great condensation. For instance, if you
                            wanted to say, "Look at the sun," you would say, "Seesun," all in one
                            word! I found that this language was much harder to acquire than the
                            others but doubtless much more valuable after you had learned it! In
                            exchange for instruction in this important branch of education, I told
                            him all I knew about Italy and the Italains, but I didn't like to tell
                            him that I doubted whether this was the language they really spoke!
                        Another face that looms up distinctly in these days, is that of Jesse
                            Brown, the carpenter. While he was at work on our veranda I was his
                            constant companion and great was the satisfaction I derived from seeing
                            the saw go through the boards, scattering the sawdust on every side, or
                            the plane that went swish! swish! across the plank and made it so smooth
                            and shiny! And then I got to know the plummet and the mitre-board and
                            the auger and the brace and bit and how simple it was to make many
                            things that before I could not understand. But  it seemed to me a great shame that the square columns of
                            our veranda were hollow, when I had always supposed that they were solid
                            all the way through! How many things in life are like them!
                        Now Jesse was something of a politician as well as philosopher and used
                            to talk to me a good deal about "State rights," and "Sectionalism"
                            things that I didn't understand. He would say: "The
                            conservative portion of this country is its flower, sir!" Now, I didn't
                            know what "conservative" meant, but the word was such a nice one that it
                            convinced me, and I said: "Yes, that is so!"
                        Every First Day we drove to meeting at a little hamlet, five miles away,
                            which was situated at the crossing of two wide and well shaded roads. It
                            was a very good neighborhood, Auntie said, for it contained three places
                            of worship and never a saloon!
                        The houses upon both the roads looked large and white and beautiful as
                            they nestled back among the trees. They had white chimneys with a black
                            rim around the edge of each, just where the smoke comes out, and when we
                            painted our chimney that way, and also put a false wooden one at one end
                            of the roof to match the real one at the other end, the whole house
                            seemed to me transformed and greatly improved.
                        The meeting-house was one of the old-fashioned kind. It was a large
                            building, covered with unpainted shingles, having a partition within of
                            sliding shutters to separate the men's side from the  women's side. The woodwork was unpainted
                            and the pine seats and floor and shutters had become dark with age.
                            There was a wood stove on each side and the stove-pipe, supported by
                            wires from the ceiling, made several interesting curves and elbows
                            before it finally went out through the high roof. As I used to sit in
                            this meeting-house on the hot summer days, the songs of the birds and
                            the waving of the green leaves outside were very tempting and in the
                            long silence I used to think of all sorts of things besides the "good
                            thoughts" about the Lord and the Bible, which people ought to think when
                            they go to meeting! The flies would come in and buzz, and sometimes a
                            big blue-bottle would take his stand in front of my face and hum and
                            flap his wings so hard and fast that you could not see them, and all
                            this just to keep in the same place hanging upon nothing! I often think
                            of these blue-bottles when I see so many human flies who flap their
                            wings very hard, year in and year out, yet hang upon little or nothing
                            and stay very much in the same place all their lives!
                        A good many of our friends used to go to this meeting. The two that come
                            first to my memory were "Becky and Anne." They were ancient maiden
                            ladies, distant relatives of ours, both very thin, small and deaf. They
                            were never seen apart and no one ever spoke of either without the other.
                            Their last name was never mentioned; that was unnecessary. They were
                            always "Becky and Anne."  They lived alone
                            in a small village not far from the meeting in a very old, shingled
                            house, which stood at the head of the main street, and was almost
                            stifled amid the trees and vines and big boxwood shrubs in the front
                            doorway. One wing of this house looked so small that it was almost like
                            a playhouse. That wing contained the dining-room, whose raftered ceiling
                            was so low that a tall man could not stand upright in it. As for
                            swinging a cat in such a room, no one would ever think of it! There were
                            tiny windows in front, only a foot or two wide, and a little table in
                            the middle set at meal times with delicate old-fashioned blue china,
                            little plates and cups and saucers that just matched the little room and
                            the little ladies who presided at the table, one at each end. I can see
                            them, too, in their oldfashioned carriage, drawn by "Bennie," a pretty
                            sorrel horse, nearly thirty years old, who trotted away cheerily and
                            briskly, to all appearance, though his steps were so short that it took
                            him a long while to go anywhere. I was always somewhat in awe of Becky
                            and Anne. They seemed to me sharp and "gruff" when they spoke, but I
                            think in fact they were fond of me for they gave me very interesting
                            books to read when I went to see them, among others, a book of proverbs,
                            with a story to each proverb, and a picture with each story.
                        I must not forget Jehiel Porter, who kept the store at Gosport, a homely
                            man with a kind face and a beard that grew thick and heavy upon the
                            margin,  but around his mouth and chin all
                            was smooth shaven, and he had a fine row of white teeth, and very big
                            hands! He lived in a large house on the main street of the village only
                            a few doors from the store, and the creek ran up behind his back yard
                            where he had a boat, a yawl, I think they called it. It looked short and
                            fat and seemed to be laughing at you. In this big house lived Jehiel and
                            his wife, Sarah, and her mother, a dear old Friend who was "a little out
                            of her mind," for she always wanted to be "going home," and would steal
                            away from the house when no one was watching and walk for hours and lose
                            herself.
                        There are two other faces that stand clearly out in my recollection: Mr.
                            Castleton and his wife, Deborah, as Auntie called them. That is just the
                            way it was. It was Mr. Castleton an dit was just plain
                            Deborah. He was a large, handsome man and very entertaining. He had a
                            fund of amusing stories and agreeable songs "O Watch ye Well
                            by Daylight," "The Low-Backed Car," "When the Kie Come Hame," etc. He
                            used to say he did not see why every one could not talk well, and he
                            gave the example how this might be done, for wherever he was he did
                            nearly all the talking, and everybody was delighted. There seemed to be
                            nothing he did not know. His little wife Deborah sat in some retired
                            spot and said not a word, yet after all she was really an important
                            ingredient in that combination, for it was she who had the money! But I
                            thought to myself:  "It ought to be worth a
                            great deal to any woman to be so well entertained all her life." I have
                            seen others since, who bartered fortune for entertainment, and they did
                            not always fare so well.
                        But the most striking face of all was that of the Episcopal clergyman of
                            the neighborhod, the Rev. Mr. Drawfish. He had dark, dreamy eyes and
                            flowing locks. He used to speak himself of the resemblance of his
                            features to those of Christ as they have come down to us in the
                            paintings of Raphael and others, and he always took great pains with his
                            personal appearance as a man ought to do who had such a priceless
                            possession. His face, his fine voice and classical education were the
                            attractions by which he sought to draw men to his particular kind of a
                            Redeemer. He talked much of his sacred calling and its
                            hardshipsthough what these were an indefinite absence of
                            particulars failed to disclose. His accent and intonation had all the
                            marks of the Apostolic succession. He rolled his "r's" in a way that no
                            "sectarian" could imitate, and none but a priest of the "church" could
                            ever hope to acquire. His diction was faultless, his sermons poetic.
                            They consisted mainly of similes, and if you could once recognize the
                            aptness of the simile, his conclusions were irrefutable. His parables,
                            however, were far more gorgeous and impressive than the simple stories
                            of the Testament and the meaning was not half so clear.
                        Humble he confessed himself to be, but it was a  kind of humility where there was vanity even in the
                            confession. He knew his own worth, and still more, his own attractions,
                            and when he had chosen for his wife the daughter of one of the
                            wealthiest of his flock, he conscientiously announced the engagement to
                            his congregation on the following Sabbath for the reason, as he
                            afterwards declared, that he would not have others conceive hopes that
                            were unattainable! He would sometimes read in advance to his friends the
                            sermon he had prepared for the the following Sunday, and when he came to
                            a complete image or a well-turned sentence, he would ask: "Is not this a
                            graphic illustration? Is not that nobly expressed?"
                    
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER X
                        THE OCEAN
                        THERE is a good deal of art in bathing in the surf
                            when the waves are high, turning your back to the breakers or diving
                            into them, and it used to be great fun to watch the greenhorns try it
                            for the first time on a rough day.
                        Once (but this was years afterwards) Smithfield and Johnson came to see
                            me. Smithfield had an innocent, childlike face and a little pug nose.
                            After he had arrayed himself in a comical baggy suit of bathing clothes
                            he walked calmly down to the edge of the water and said to Johnson, with
                            innocent confidence: "Now let us go in and take the waves." The breakers
                            were heavy that day, and as a wave that had dashed upon the beach flowed
                            back, he followed it, and walked into the water calmly and confidently,
                            facing another bigger one which was just coming. I stood back and
                            watched the consequences. The big wave curled over just in front of him,
                            there was a dash, a wild leap of spray in a long line upon the shore,
                            and Smithfield was lost to sight. The next thing I saw was the receding
                            water, and way up on the beach there was a head sticking in the sand,
                            and two legs kicking wildly in the air. Another wave caught him just as
                            he was getting out of the  tangle, until at
                            last, battered and breathless, he betook himself to flight and did not
                            consider himself quite safe until the door of the bathing house was
                            fastened and locked behind him.
                        But what rapture there is in the sea to one who knows it, who can plunge
                            through the long lines of foam and, swimming out beyond them, rise and
                            fall with the big swells and watch the "multitudious laughter" of the
                            waves around him as the sun strikes their glittering crests! It was not
                            long until I had learned the joy of this and began to revel among them
                            as if I had been one of their own creatures.
                        Yet the ocean, which bore such raptures in its hours of merriment, was
                            filled with terror for me when in the darkness I could hear its solemn
                            voice filled, as I thought, with menace and despair. There was a huge
                            wreck far down the beach, and one day, when I went to look at the great
                            spars and the high prow and the scattered timbers of the big ship, an
                            old fisherman told me the story of the calamity. She came ashore in the
                            night when the wind was wild and the waves were so angry that the boat
                            they dragged along the beach and tried to launch was dashed to pieces
                            when the first breaker struck it. "The sand and spray were blown into
                            our faces so we could see nothing. All was black. They were close by and
                            we could hear their screams, and hear them calling to us for help, yet
                            we could do nothing, but hang our heads and let them die. Only three
                            were savedone was a man whose wife was torn  away from him, and the next day he walked
                            back and forth, back and forth, all the day upon the beach, watching for
                            the sea to give her up, but the sea kept her. Do you see that farmhouse
                            over there? Well, they took the dead to that house and laid them out and
                            all the rooms were full and then people came down from the city looking
                            for their folks, and the men broke down and cried just like the
                            womenand one of the bodies that came ashore was a woman and
                            she had a baby in her arms wrapped in a shawl, and it lay there as if it
                            were asleep."
                        That night there was a full moon, and from my bed I could see the mast
                            leaning sideways above the bluff a long way off, and I lay awake
                            thinking of the dreadful scene. The crash and the waves and the spray
                            and the darkness and the shrieks and the corpses all mingled
                            indistinguishably together in my imagination. The more I thought of it
                            the more awful it seemed, and I reflected: "If even upon this blessed
                            earth such things can be, how much more terrible must be the endless
                            agonies of hell!" I began to wonder whether perhaps I had not committed
                            some transgression which might cast me into its unspeakable
                            tormentsand the text came to my mind about the sin which finds
                            forgiveness neither in this world, nor in the world to come. I
                            remembered a man who had come to see us a few weeks before and had made
                            a joke about a profane song, and I had laughed at it! Perhaps that was
                            the unpardonable sin! And my poor little head grew  hot as I lay awake all night thinking of the horrors that
                            were awaiting mefrom which no escape was ever possible. This
                            dreadful nightmare hung over me for weeks until I thought I should go
                            wild. I told father of it, but he did not seem to understand how
                            terrible a thing it was. Every night I could hear about my bed the wind
                            and the dashing of the waves and the shrieks, and I could see that poor
                            mother with her shawl around the child, both swept together into the
                            merciless flood. Then I saw before me an eternity of such visions, all
                            for my thoughtless laughter, which was to have forgiveness neither in
                            this world nor in the world to come!
                        How many a poor creature has spent his life in the madhouse because he
                            pondered too long over that fatal text! If it might be permitted to
                            subtract aught from the sacred word, how many a kind soul would blot out
                            the dreadful menace of these cruel lines from a book so full elsewhere
                            of love and gentleness! But, alas! there is another curse upon the
                            expurgation, and many a child who has misquoted his text and added
                            something or left out a word, has fallen beneath the shadow of a fear
                            that perhaps his own name has been blotted from the "Lamb's Book of
                            Life."
                        So deep and lasting were these morbid thoughts, that during the rest of
                            the summer a settled melancholy took possession of me which was not
                            dissipated until I was back in the city and at school.
                    
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER XI
                        SCHOOL
                        MY health was so delicate that I was not sent to
                            school until I was nearly eleven years of age. My education, however,
                            suffered little from this, for I picked up quite as much at home,
                            browsing among readers and histories and biographies, as ever I would
                            have learned in the class-room. At first I went to a public school, but
                            my attendance there was very intermittent. After a week or two I would
                            catch cold and then I would have to stay home two or three weeks with
                            the croup, and with that dreadful ipecac. There are only a few
                            recollections that peer out from the mist of that first school life. I
                            remember that when any of the boys misbehaved they were sent "on the
                            line" for punishment, and there they had to wait until one of the
                            teachers came around to administer it. There was one little scamp named
                            Pierce who used to prepare himself when he contemplated some atrocious
                            misdeed by putting on two or three pairs of trousers, one over the
                            other, and when the rattan resounded on his little legs we could tell
                            from the sound of it how many pairs he had on that day. But he always
                            cried so lustily that I don't think the teacher ever suspected.
                        
                        But it was not long that I went to the public school. A private academy
                            was established not far from where we lived, and I became one of the
                            pupils. This was a much nicer school, I thought, than the other. The
                            building was new and neat and in front of it was a pretty little park
                            where we used to play during recess. The boys and girls were together in
                            the same class, the classes were much smaller and the teachers were much
                            more pleasant and polite! There was Mr. Trueblood, who taught
                            mathematics; Miss Fowler, who instructed us in history and geography,
                            and Miss Hitchcock, with whom we learned grammar, etymology and
                            elocution. There was a big chart upon the wall of the assembly-room
                            where we recited to her and upon this chart were all the sounds of all
                            the vowels and I was astonished to see that there were four sounds for
                            "a"aye-ahh-aw-ah! We had to stand up and repeat these sounds
                            every day, in concert, at the top of our voices. And Tom Tucker who
                            stood at the end of the line once got Joe McDowell to prick him with a
                            pin just as we came to the final diphthong, "ow!" and he howled it forth
                            dismally and at great length in a very natural manner.
                        Once a week we had to "speak our pieces." Jack Sheridan declaimed "The
                            Raven" so grandly that we were sure he would become one of the finest
                            orators in the world. My particular chum was Joe McDowell, who had a
                            solemn face, but who was really full of mischief. Once when he was
                            called upon he  gave us in a deep, solemn
                            voice: "Sing a Song of Sixpence," gesticulating very impressively and
                            pretending to nip off the end of his own nose just at the close.
                        Miss Hitchcock used to correct our compositions. I had written one
                            entitled "The Wreck," of which I was very proud, especially of the last
                            sentence, which described the scene that followed the catastrophe. I
                            worked at it so long and hard that I can remember it still. It ran
                            thus:
                        "'Tis morn. The sun has risen with resplendent grandeur and the sea has
                            become calm from its storm of the night before. The sea-gull and the
                            petrel are the only visitants to the spot where disappeared that gallant
                            ship with all its precious cargo, and the billows of the ocean alone
                            sing a requiem for the dead."
                        When Miss Hitchcock read these lines there was a quizzical expression on
                            her face, and she asked me whether I had done all that
                                myself. My cheeks flushed with conscious pride, as I answered:
                            "Every word of it!" I think now that a good part of it was "fished" from
                            certain phrases that prowled perhaps unconsciously through the by-ways
                            of memory, but I am sure that at the time I thought it "very original."
                            Another composition that I took great pride in was one where the death
                            of Napoleon was contrasted with that of the humble Christian. I had
                            worked up a terrible storm at St. Helena, as  well as in the perturbed spirit of Bonaparte, and ended the scene in
                            the following climax:
                        "And with 'Tête d' Armée' upon his expiring lips the
                            conqueror of nations rushed into the presence of his Maker."
                        After this began an adagio:
                        "It was a quiet Sabbath eve; the sun was just hiding behind a mass of
                            white clouds fringed with gold; the church bells were ringing in the
                            gray steeple just behind the wood," etc., etc., while upon his bed the
                            good old man had visions of angels and archangels and passed away with a
                            smile upon his lips.
                        Father considered this a very edifying production; as for myself, I
                            prized it more for its fine artistic form than for its ethical or
                            spiritual value!
                        Besides our regular instructors there were others who came two or three
                            hours a week to teach us special things. One of these was Mr. Bendetto,
                            the drawing-master. He was a painter of some distinction, who used to
                            become so absorbed with his own work at the studio that he never thought
                            to come to school at all, and sometimes at the end of the hour he would
                            rush in out of breath with flushed face and disheveled hair, exclaiming
                            in repentant tones: "I forgot it again!"
                        But our most curious and interesting specimen was Professor Jacquette,
                            the French teacher. He had a shrewd Gallic face with sharp, black eyes
                            and aquiline nose. He was clean shaven except a  small pair of mutton-chop whiskers just in front of his
                            ears which were always dyed black and dyed so often that you could
                            hardly ever see the little bit of gray that still occasionally peeped
                            out just at the roots. He must have been very bald for he wore a black
                            wig that covered all his head except two little places at the side where
                            his hair was dyed as carefully as his whiskers. I am sure he was a very
                            old man, yet he acted like a young beau. His clothes were always
                            carefully brushed, his shirt bosom was always white and shiny, he was
                            agile, and gesticulated with much grace, and he was politeness itself,
                            especially to the girls. Whenever one of them on entering or leaving the
                            room tried to walk behind him, he always tilted his chair back against
                            the blackboard so that there was no room to pass and then she had to go
                            around in front of the table where he was sitting, while he smiled
                            deferentially. This seemed to us the acme of Parisian courtesy. I am
                            sure none of us boys would ever have thought of doing anything quite so
                            polite as that! Yet his courtesy was also Parisian in the fact that it
                            always yielded to a stronger impulse when a sudden puff of anger took
                            possession of him. Once when the mother of two of his pupils wrote him a
                            little note on tinted paper saying that his "system" (for like all
                            French teachers he had a system) was "parfaitement
                                ridicule," he jumped up and stamped around the room and swore
                            dreadful French oaths,  and it even seemed
                            to us he was in danger of tearing his wig off.
                        Professor Jacquette told us delightful anecdotes. The two which have been
                            most firmly fixed in my memory are "Ze Tail of ze Rat" and "Ze Tail of
                            ze Bear." "Ze Tail of ze Rat" arose out of a discussion of the French
                            equivalent for "pie." Various kinds of pie were spoken of, among others
                            mince pie. "You like meence pie?" said the Professor. "Ah, I nevaire,
                            nevaire could not eat meence pie. For vy? Vun time I valk down Broadway
                            and I step into ze restraurant and I call ze garçon, ze vat you call
                            him? ze vaitaire, and I ask him to breeng me a piece of meence
                            pieand he breeng ze piece of pie and I put him in my mout and
                            I feel someting vair strange, vair strange, and I pull him out and py
                            gar! zaire vas ze tail of a rat! O, I nevaire, nevaire could not eat
                            meence pie aftair zat!" The old professor dramatized the last part of
                            his story so realistically by his gestures and expressions of dismay,
                            that mince pie was not a favorite article of diet with any of us for
                            some time afterwards.
                        "Ze Tail of ze Bear," had a deeper moral purpose. It was directed against
                            the sin of exaggeration. "You do evair exaggairate?" asked the
                            professor. "You do evair exaggairate?" asked the professor. "You should
                            nevaire, nevaire exaggairate. For vy? Vun time zair vas vun grand
                            gentleman in France vat have ze habit of to exaggairate, so he tells his
                            laquai, his sairvante, zat venever he do hear him to exaggairate, he
                            pull him  by ze tail of ze
                            coatso! so!" and the professor gave a lively jerk to the tail
                            of his own coat. "So vun day zair vas vun grand dinner at zees
                            gentleman's house and zair vas many people and zey talk about ze bear,
                            and vun man say he kill so many bear, and vun man say he kill a bear vot
                            is so big! And zees gentleman say he kill a bear vot have a tail so long, so long," and the professor
                            stretched out his arms at full length. "And zen ze laquai who stand
                            behind him pull hees tail, so! so!" and the professor fitted the action
                            to the word. "'Non! Non! Parbleu, Messieurs,' zees gentleman do say, 'ze
                            tail of ze bear vas not so long, but so long vas ze tail of ze bear!" Here the professor showed us
                            the length of one armthen he described another pull to the
                            coat-tail, and another reduction down to half a yard, then down to a
                            foot, then six inchestill at last with a voice full of
                            humiliation and despair came the confession: "Pardon, messieurs, ze bear
                            I kill have no tail at all, and I no kill ze bear."
                        I used to supplement my French instruction at school by conversations one
                            evening a week at Mme. Des Champs"soirees," we called
                            themand Annie Wayfield, one of the older girls, used to go
                            with me. Professor Aimé did most of the conversing, and sometimes he
                            would read to us. He read quietly as if he were talking and I did not
                            think him half so fine an elocutionist as Professor Jacquette, who
                            became very impressive when he declaimed passages from the French drama,
                            and who  was the greatest of all, we
                            thought, in the scene from "Cinna," where Auguste first discloses to his
                            friends his knowledge of Cinna's conspiracy.
                        Our hearts all thrilled with Gallic fire when Auguste crushed poor Cinna
                            with the proofs of his perfidy; and we used to wonder whether Talma
                            himself could ever have declaimed so well as that.
                        Aimé, on the other hand, was a mild little man who never could impress
                            anybody, and he had a little girl, a beautiful child, whom he used to
                            bring with him sometimes to the soirées. She was very
                            well behaved, and appeared to be very fond of her father, calling him
                            not "papa," but "Jean," which was his first name, and talking to him in
                            a very familiar manner. He told us that he had brought her up that
                            wayand we all thought, "How strange!" You see, I am dropping
                            the "professor" and calling him plain "Aimé." He was that kind of a man.
                            He didn't seem to care about his dignity. And he was right; let dignity
                            take care of itself, I say. If it comes naturally, well enough. If it
                            has to be tended and watched and kept out of the wet and cold, it is
                            better to part with it altogether. One of the funniest things in life is
                            to see some little fellow with a squeaky voice looking to the careful
                            preservation of his dignity. Dignity is like love "Sie
                                kommt and sie ist da." Otherwise it isn't dignity at all.
                        The little Aimé girl was the first child I ever heard talking French and
                            it made her seem to me a  very learned
                            child, for she spoke it much more correctly and fluently than I could
                            after all my study. Even to-day, I cannot hear a child talk French
                            without unconsciously wondering at it. To hear one talk German never
                            seems so astonishing. The German words are the homely household words
                            that you expect to hear from the lips of the little ones. But the
                            romance languages are filled with Latin derivativesLatin is to
                            us the learned tongueand to hear the baby speaking the words
                            of the lectureroom suggests precocity.
                        Sometimes Mr. Aimé could not come to the soirees, and
                            his place was filled by Mademoiselle Conet, a lady of advancing years,
                            harsh voice and the rudiments of a moustache. Somebody once asked her if
                            she were a poet! Whereupon she drew a fine distinction between the
                            poetry of the soul and the poetry of mere words. She was a poet of the
                            soul! In the presence of nature, of the flowers, the sky, the forest,
                            her soul was transformed and exalted, and I don't know what. But with
                            the jingling of the rhymster she had no sympathy. The idea of cramping
                            these divine thoughts into feet and measures was abominable. She was a
                            poet whose thoughts were too fine even to be set in words! There are
                            many poets of that kind in the world.
                    
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER XII
                        SUPPLEMENTARY EDUCATIONCOMMENCEMENT
                        AS time passed on, I learned to smoke, an art which I
                            began to consider necessary to manliness and self-respect. I learned it
                            amid the tribulations that usually accompany the acquisition of this
                            useful branch of knowledge. I had tried cigarettes several times, and
                            they had never harmed me, so once when I was in the country visiting my
                            friend, Bob Shaw, and he offered me a cigar, I took it as a matter of
                            course and smoked it as if I were quite used to cigars and had been in
                            the habit of smoking all my life. But a little while afterwards a
                            horrible feeling overcame me. I tried to stifle it, but it would not
                            down. I went out of the house and said I wanted to take a walk in the
                            woods, which was quite true, but the dreadful consequences of my rash
                            deed were not to be postponed. The cause of my pale face could not be
                            hidden and my previous innocence of this manly art was revealed not only
                            to Bob himself but, worst of all, to his pretty sister, Janet, who, I
                            thought, had looked upon me with a certain admiration, but whose smiles
                            afterwards were undoubtedly those of pity. I would have been willing to
                            go through that ordeal many times (and it was not a light one) if I
                            could have kept the knowledge  of it from
                            her. But my cup of shame and humiliation was full till I got safely
                            home. When the fateful step was once taken I was bound to persevere,
                            though I watched more carefully the size of the cigar and noted the
                            strength of the tobacco. At last I could smoke with anybody, and my
                            companions failed to floor me even when they conspired to put hair in my
                            pipe. Thus does the boy grow in knowledge and discretion.
                        Jack Sheridan, the boy who was to be an orator, took me to visit him in
                            his home up in the Catskills, and one night we went bobbing for eels by
                            torch-light. It was midnight before we returned and then Jack brought
                            out from the cellar a wonderful treasurea bottle of
                            champagne"That is," said Jack, "it is champagne cider, which
                            is really just the same thing"and with that bottle and some
                            cakes we had a Sybarite feast while everybody else in the house was fast
                            asleep. There was something deliciously wicked about the union of
                            champagne cider with such late hours.
                        But going to see the country girls on Sunday was the greatest fun.
                            Sometimes we found a swain in the house who looked very glum when we
                            entered, and who always stayed till after we were gone. We, being city
                            boys, were the chief attractions so long as we lasted, but the swain
                            would pick up a little courage and begin to look cheerful as soon as he
                            saw us ready to go. One of the girls had on a rich brocade dress
                            decidedly faded, which had come  down from
                            a more prosperous antiquity. There was also a piano which spoke in
                            faltering accents of a more illustrious past, but there was nothing
                            faltering about the girl's voice or her dashing figure as she played and
                            sang "The Mocking Bird" with such spirit and life that you would have
                            said that the bird was enlivening a marriage festival rather than
                            warbling over a grave.
                        Although Annie Jones was the head of my class and delivered the
                            valedictory, I had a good deal of glory on the day of our graduation at
                            the academy. My child's dream of writing a great poem had not vanished
                            during the time I was at school, and I thought that an epic on the
                            conquest of Peru would be a worthy theme for my muse. So I devoted
                            myself to Prescott's work and projected a poem which, if it had been
                            completed upon the magnificent plan proposed must have taken some ten
                            years for its composition.
                        I began with a prelude about the Vale of Cuzco and the great temple and
                            the sun rising 
                                
                                    "O'er far Sorata's gleaming peak,"
                                
                             where, after dispelling the mist of the valley and 
                                
                                    "Piercing with his rays
                                    Its every nook, he seems to search and ask
                                    'Where are my children?'"
                                
                             This was in blank verse. Then followed a description  of the glories of the ancient Peruvian
                            empire in ballad metre, describing how 
                                
                                    "The Inca's rainbow-banner waved o'er nations near and
                                        far,
                                    Conquering more by mild persuasion than by fierce and
                                        angry war,"
                                
                             and how the great Huayna Capac on his deathbed told of his father's
                            spirit which prophesied, as is the custom in such cases, of the coming
                            of the white men, and how he divided his kingdom between Huascar, his
                            eldest son, and Atahuallpa, his favorite, giving Cuzco to his first born
                            and Quito to his best beloved, and advising the brothers to dwell in
                            peace.
                        Then I went off into Homeric hexameters, though I took a "poetic license"
                            to prefix a short syllable to some of the lines, like a grace-note in
                            music, as I had heard it called, and I began to describe the quarrel
                            between two Incas and the invasion of Cuzco by Atahuallpa. The
                            hexameters began thus:
                        
                            "'Tis the Peruvian summer. The tropical sun in his fervor
                            Hurls on the lowlands and sea-coasts his parching and pestilent
                                arrows,
                            While on the lofty sierras his fiery beams vainly endeavor
                            To scatter the chill of the winter and strip the snow garb from
                                the mountains."
                        
                        Then followed an account of the marshaling of the troops and the battle
                            and the conquest of Cuzco by the tribes of the North.
                        Now I had taken so long to manufacture these  various varieties of verse and to bring the Peruvians down to the
                            place where they were to be conquered, that I had not time to get to
                            Pizarro and the conquest at all. So I had to leave that out with a brief
                            allusion to the "darkest of history's chapters," and an invocation to
                            Oblivion to cast its "thick pall" over the events which my great epic of
                            manifold versification was intended to celebrate.
                        Perhaps you have seen some temples where the portico and the vestibule
                            were so elaborate that there was little room for the sanctuary inside.
                            It is said that when the Roman conqueror inspected the Holy of Holies in
                            Jerusalem he found there was nothing in it. My poem was of similar
                            construction. The "Conquest" was so entirely absent that I felt
                            constrained to change the name of the great work and to call it instead
                            "The Fate of Peru," for it seemed to me that the beginning and the end
                            might be enough to show what had been the fate of a country, whereas
                            many intermediate cantos would be required to tell about its
                            conquest.
                        Even thus, however, the poem had to have a conclusion. Commencement day
                            was almost upon me, yet the rhymes and verses would not come. Then I
                            remembered "Evangeline," how Longfellow began: "This is the forest
                            primeval," and then ended his poem in the same way, repeating a number
                            of the lines that he had written before. Even Homer sometimes repeated
                            himself. So I brought out my  introductory
                            verses again and then left the Sun seeking his children in the Vale of
                            Cuzco, to wit:
                        
                            "His earliest beams
                            Appear o'er far Sorata's gleaming peak,
                            He lingers for a while in mute amaze
                            On that high summit that the wonted shout
                            Greets not his coming. With a searching look
                            He pierces the deep mists that hide the earth.
                            The shepherds of those mountain sides are gone;
                            Their pall, the vapors that conceal the vale
                            Their dirge, the winds that play among the hills."
                        
                        Although the great epic of my youth was thus brought up with a rather
                            sudden turn at the end and did not fulfil the promise of its earlier
                            stanzas, yet, is not that the fate of the greatest works of genius? The
                            concluding books of the Odyssey or of Paradise Lost fall below the
                            standard of the earlier ones. The Inferno and Purgatorio are greatly
                            superior to the Paradiso. The first acts of Hamlet and Macbeth are
                            better than the last, and you will sometimes come across an essay of
                            Macaulay or De Quincey, most elaborately conceived, which marches along
                            for a while with slow and steady tread and then makes a sudden rush and
                            scramble just at the end, so as to get through in time.
                        So I felt that with all the shortcomings of my great epic there might
                            some time be a laurel crown in store for me, and my ambitions were
                            further confirmed by the motto affixed to my commencement  bouquet, sent by some unknown hand: "Consequitur quodcunque petit""He attains
                            whatever he seeks." This inspired me for two or three weeks afterwards
                            with immense determination!
                    
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER XIII
                        PREPARING FOR COLLEGE
                        AFTER my graduation it was determined that I should go
                            to college, but mother could not have me away from home, so a college in
                            the city was selected. It was decided I should have a tutor and a
                            certain Mr. Hobson was employed. Exactly why we chose him I do not know.
                            He was a man over seventy years of age; his clothes were always dirty,
                            he waddled like a duck as he came down the street and always carried a
                            market-basket on his arm containing an assortment of old text-books. He
                            had a flabby face and a double chin and two little leering eyes close to
                            a huge nose with a beard at the end of ita beard which he
                            shaved only twice a week, so that on Wednesday and Saturday his nose
                            looked very grisly. Every two or three days he would borrow a quarter or
                            sometimes a dime for carfare, which he always forgot to pay back. He was
                            a disagreeable old fellow, but he understood Latin grammar and Greek
                            verbs "av ovo usque ad mala," and under his
                            instruction I pushed ahead at a rapid rate.
                        Hobson was a great scandal-monger, and when at my recommendation he was
                            employed by Mr. Macdonald as a tutor for his boys, who were two  of my closest friends, and when the
                            father agreed to give him twice the price he asked, he showed his
                            appreciation by saying that the man must be a fool and he retailed to me
                            a lot of silly gossip about the family. I found he acted with
                            impartiality between the two houses in this respect, and after trying in
                            vain to stop the tattle myself I called upon father to see if he
                            couldn't silence the old man. At first father was disposed to laugh at
                            the thing, but finding I insisted he came down one morning with a face
                            as black as the nightυυκτὶ
                            ὲοικώςfor he brought to my mind in an instant
                            Homer's description of Apollo, and when he accused Hobson of retailing
                            falsehoods concerning us, the old man trembled and stammered out, first
                            lies and then excuses, and after father left the room the poor tutor
                            couldn't tell the tense or the mood or the conjugation of anything for
                            the rest of that lesson. But there was no more tale-bearing.
                        Hobson was very pedantic concerning trifling matters. He made it a great
                            point that no one should say "The City of New York,"
                            but always "The City, New York." Any one who used the former expression
                            must be a very ignorant fellow. But after a while I found a Greek
                            genitive used in the same way, that disconcerted him greatly. I never
                            liked to walk out with him for he used to forget to wear a collar, nor
                            was it pleasant to ride with him in the street car, for he would stop
                            forever at the wrong streets and always talked so loud everybody  could hear and upon subjects I didn't
                            want discussed. He would explain, for instance, where I could buy the
                            cheapest second-hand text-books, and this when I was with friends who
                            never bought second-hand books themselves and who looked surprised. When
                            I went to college to be examined for admission, he insisted on going
                            with me and he looked very dirty, stole a catalogue from the President's
                            private desk and shuffled his feet on the floor in a manner most
                            exasperating to a poor pupil who was struggling ineffectually with
                            irregular aorists.
                        My examination in Greek was not triumphant. As I entered the room with
                            Hobson tagging after me, a stately old gentleman, clean-shaven, with a
                            lofty forehead, large, dark, piercing eyes and a mobile mouth, sat like
                            one of the gods or Titans of the elder dynasty in a high box or rostrum
                            at the end of the room. I can see his face before me, as I write; it
                            almost seems to be surrounded by a halo, so dazzling the impression left
                            upon my memory. On the wall were portraits of celebrated Greek scholars,
                            Porson, Dindorf, Blomfield, and I know not whom else. Against two sides
                            of the room there were long benches and in front of each were narrow
                            desks. Just at the foot of the rostrum theré was a big chair with a
                            bookrest on one of its arms and in this chair a tall, slim fellow was
                            then undergoing an examination. I noticed that when he scanned he always
                            called a dactyl a dactel, and while  I
                            thought he translated pretty well, Dr. Grandison (he was the Titan) did
                            not seem to think so, for he told him to come again in the fall and try
                            it once more. He called me next and asked: "Have you read Plutarch?" Now
                            I hadn't read a word, but I didn't like to confess it in that splendid
                            presence, and in my confusion I answered "Not much of Plutarch." "Well,
                            in that case we will take the first extract." I cast my eyes over it but
                            couldn't translate a line. He had caught me at once in what might be
                            called "a fib with mitigating circumstances." When I came to know Dr.
                            Grandison better I always "owned up," for the consequences of even a
                            total failure were less to be dreaded at his hands than a discovery of
                            the slightest prevarication. He was a masterful man, a prince of
                            old-fashioned pedagogues, full of his jokes and his sarcasm and his
                            bonhomie too, toward those candid fellows who never tried to appear
                            better than they were.
                        I was examined on the Anabasis. But by this time I was so confused that
                            the paragraphs turned themselves inside out and upside down and I made a
                            dismal failure of it. Meantime old Hobson sat puffing and blinking his
                            eyes and shuffling his feet and adding tenfold to my humiliation.
                        But Dr. Grandison gave me a last chance at Homer. The passage was in the
                            third book, an invocation to old father Jupiter. I can hear the  dactyls and spondees ringing in my ears
                            to-day. This was the opening line:
                        
                            
                                Ζεῦ κύδιστε μὲγιστε, καὶ ὰθάνατοι θεοὶ ἄλλοι
                            
                        
                        In Homer the verses and the sense were so linked together that my memory
                            could not be upset even by embarrassment. I knew the passage perfectly
                            and answered his questions without flinching. "You may thank old Homer
                            for that," said the professor, as he marked "passed" upon my card.
                        I blush even now to think how green I was in those days. That summer I
                            kept a journal of my doings as well as my reflections upon the
                            commonplace incidents in my small worldcertain verdant
                            moralizing and a philosophy whereby to steer my life through unknown
                            seas.
                        No one shall ever see that journal! Never! For, though I am willing to
                            let it be known in a general way that I was a good deal of a goose, I
                            shall not reveal all the minute particulars of my folly. There are
                            little episodes in our lives that no one ever dares to speak of after he
                            has reached years of maturity. No crimes nor any great wickedness, but I
                            don't think we would be half so much ashamed of them if they had been
                            cases of respectable manslaughter. Now some of those things in the
                            innocency of my boyish heart I put down in that journal and I think it
                            great good fortune that I stumbled upon the book a few weeks ago and
                            destroyed it. So I shall certainly not tell all the things that even  now make my flesh creep, just as it
                            creeps when a pencil is scratched the wrong way upon a slate.
                        I think I was most ridiculous in the presence of young women. I could
                            overcome my fears of physical suffering or danger much more quickly than
                            my bashfulness. It seemed to me that girls were always making fun of me,
                            and a boy may be willing to be pounded by another boy, but he does not
                            like to be laughed at by a girl. One, the prettiest girl I ever knew,
                            was Delia Carlisle. She had wavy light brown hair, blue eyes and lips
                            that were always laughing. She knew I was afraid of her and used to say
                            the sauciest and most tantalizing things, and somehow my tongue would
                            stick to my mouth so I could never answer. I was so bashful that if she
                            sat by my side upon a bench or sofa I would unconsciously "edge off" to
                            the opposite end. Sometimes, on the other hand, I was inordinately
                            impudent and assumed an extraordinary boldness as a cover for my fear.
                            Two-thirds of the ill-mannered men of the world owe their bad graces to
                            their timidity. They are rude or reserved because they are afraid to be
                            natural.
                        After I had finished my college entrance examinations, Joe McDowell and I
                            agreed to ask two of our girl friends to go with us to the coming
                            commencement. Joe was to ask Mattie Halfine and I was to ask Bessie
                            Brown. Each was to support the other loyally in his undertaking by
                            standing just around the corner of the street while his companion made
                                 the call and gave the invitation. It
                            rained on the day that this was done. Now exactly what consolation
                            either Joe or I could derive in preferring our requests from the fact
                            that there was a companion standing outside in the rain and awaiting the
                            outcome, I am at this maturer period of life not quite prepared to
                            explain, but it is certain that this moral support seemed needful, and a
                            slight drenching was a small price to pay for the mutual protection
                            afforded by such friendship.
                        The girls went with us to the commencement, but neither we nor they knew
                            how to act nor what to do, and when afterwards we invited them to
                            Delmonico's, we hadn't the slightest idea of what we ought to call for,
                            and a great solemn looking waiter in a swallow-tailed coat seemed to be
                            smiling upon our inexperience.
                        All through life I have had a constant dread of a silent, well-dressed,
                            experienced man-servant. Whenever his own manners are irreproachable it
                            always seems to me that he is offering a silent criticism upon mine, and
                            that when tried by his inexorable standard, I must very often fall far
                            short of what I ought to be.
                    
                
                
                
                    Book II
                    THE NEW ERA
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER I
                        MY BEARD
                        IF the day of his birth begins the first period in a
                            boy's life, his second great cycle of existence undoubtedly commences
                            when he first puts the razor to his face. This is the new Anno Domini from which all things ought henceforth to be
                            reckoned in place of the Anno Mundi of the past; it is
                            the time when childhood is forever put away and when budding manhood
                            with its new glories and responsibilities sets forth upon its proud
                            career.
                        Therefore since the immortal Homer always allows at least a preliminary
                            line or two to the rosy-fingered morn that ushers in an eventful day, I
                            cannot pass without some lingering comment over the great step that
                            ushered the dignity of manhood into my own life. But however stupendous
                            the subject, I refrain from keeping my reader lingering over the story
                            as long and impatiently as I waited for that beard. O those weeks and
                            months of grim suspense! George Downing had shaved a year ago and had
                            brought his razor to school to prove it to usthat was before I
                            left the academybut although I was nearly as old as he, the
                            marks of manliness on my cheeks and lips were still entirely latent.
                            This could no longer be borne! It is well known that among  the military virtues, endurance is often
                            evidence of a higher order of courage than mere impetuous
                            dashthat the troops who will charge unflinching upon the
                            enemy's line, may waver if forced under a prolonged and wearisome
                            cannonade to await the attack of the hostile force. A prudent general
                            will therefore sometimes lead them forth to encounter their assailants.
                            In meeting an approaching beard the same tactics are sometimes adopted.
                            At some period in the long, weary waiting, patience fails and the boy
                            resolves to sally forth and encounter the invader, of whose approach he
                            is certain, even though no visible evidence is at hand.
                        When I found that the down upon my upper lip was thicker than it had been
                            in childhood, I took that for encouragement enough and determined to
                            act. I did not dare go to a barber for I knew he would laugh at me. I
                            would do the work myself and in secrecy. So I furtively purchased the
                            necessary apparatus, and even this with much apprehension, speaking to
                            the vendor in such a way that I hoped he would think I was buying it for
                            someone else. There was a faint smile on his face as he handed me the
                            package, and I never went to that shop again. Beware, O tradesman, how
                            you discover the foibles of youth or it may cost you many a
                            customer!
                        I had watched my father's proceedings down to the most minute particular,
                            and now tried to imitate them with Chinese fidelity. I was astonished to
                            feel how cold the lather was after the warm water  evaporated. As to the razor, I could not quite make out
                            how to hold it, or which way to draw it. I remembered that mother had
                            often cautioned father about his jugular vein and I thought it would be
                            more prudent to leave the neck until some future occasion, when I should
                            be more experienced. I don't know how it happened, but while the
                            instrument was gliding smoothly over my left cheek, my hand slipped, and
                            there was a big gash under my ear to betray to an inquisitive circle of
                            relatives and friends what I had been doing. Father saw it and laughed.
                            Mother noticed it and anxiously besought me to avoid such unnecessary
                            perils. Cousin Jasper perceived it and told me about the soft downy
                            feeling on the upper lip that I would never have again. Some of my
                            classmates observed it but they made less account of it than I had
                            feared, having perhaps similar experiences or anticipations of their
                            own. Until my face was healed, I remained as far as I could a hermit
                            from the world, especially from the feminine part of it. But when the
                            gash became imperceptible the embarrasing observations were
                            discontinued. My next effort was less calamitous, and in time I came to
                            approach even the fatal jugular, and this, too, when there was little
                            need for such a risk, for it was still some months before anything like
                            a beard came to justify the use of the razor that had so long
                            anticipated it.
                        But the beard was only a symbol. With its advent, and with the beinnings
                            of college life, the tender conscience, 
                            the Quaker traditions and the childlike simplicity of my boyhood were
                            swept away like that down upon the lip, while the stifer and hardier
                            bristles of worldly experience grew in their place. I had not been many
                            months amid my new surroundings until I grew to be as precious a scamp
                            as ever took part in the madcap pranks of disorderly students and made
                            miserable the life of long-suffering professors.
                        Under and behind this transformation there yet remained, no doubt, a
                            subsoil of better principles which lay too deep for total extermination
                            and which was to reappear after the "wild oats" had been sown and
                            harvested. But to all external appearances the transformation was
                            complete. There is a part of college training not laid down in the
                            curriculum, but quite as important to those who acquire it, as Greek,
                            mathematics or philosophy. The alphabet of this kind of instruction was
                            given us at the very outset of our college career. Our instructors were
                            not named in the list of the faculty, but they were borne upon the
                            roster of the class that preceded our own.
                        The Sophomore is always filled with an earnest solicitude for the proper
                            education of Freshmen. This education assumes many shapes. Its first
                            great object is the extinction of all forms of self-importance and the
                            inculcation of the virtues taught in the beatitudes which bless the
                            meek, the poor in spirit, the reviled and persecuted. A good drubbing,
                            just  at the beginning of one's career, is
                            therefore considered a salutary introduction to college life.
                        The very day we entered the Sophomores began their beneficent education.
                            They drew themselves up in two lines along the walls of a narrow
                            passage, through which we had to go to our lecture rooms, and we
                            Freshmen passing between them in single file were compelled to run the
                            gauntlet to our great discomfort, being thumped first against one wall
                            and then against the other. But the next day by a master stroke of
                            tactics we turned the tables, for we entered the hall two abreast, arm
                            in arm, and by vigorously rushing first to the right and then to the
                            left and jamming the fellows on each side against the wall we made it
                            more unpleasant for them than they could possibly make it for us, so
                            that their efforts for our moral improvement by this simple process came
                            to an untimely end.
                    
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER II
                        OUR SECRET SOCIETIES
                        ANOTHER important step toward my introduction into
                            college life was the initiation into one of the Greek letter
                            fraternities of the college. There is always a great rivalry among these
                            fraternities to secure the most available men in each new class, and the
                            first few months of college life are devoted to an earnest canvass by
                            the members of these secret orders in which the exalted merits of the
                            Kappa Delta Omega are contrasted with the utter worthlessnesss of Psi
                            Theta Omicron in a most convincing manner.
                        Some of the men sent out to "work" us, however, showed very little tact.
                            For instance, when Mortimer was setting before me the superior
                            attractions of the Kappa Phi he contemptuously sneered at the Sigma Taus
                            as a set of stupid saints who had a kind of chapel and prayer-meeting
                            services and nothing stronger to drink than ginger ale. But at that
                            time, poor innocent that I was, I determined that this was the kind of a
                            fraternity I wanted to join, so as to preserve my little white soul from
                            the world, the flesh and the devil. Thrown thus into the arms of
                            something so entirely virtuous, I must confess that my initiation into
                            the Sigma Taus was  not without its
                            surprises, both as to the ceremonies pursued in the installation, and
                            the illusory character of the sanctity of the organization itself. I may
                            not reveal the details. It was such great fun, however, that I not only
                            became hardened in sin in a very brief space of time, but grew intensely
                            eager that those who were still without the pale should participate in
                            similar solemnities. Indeed, we were not satisfied with plain, ordinary
                            Greek letter secrecy, but a few of us began to start new societies of
                            our own, of a very evanescent character for the benefit of simple-minded
                            "neutrals" who wanted to join something, but who were not sufficiently
                            attractive to get into one of the regular fraternities. One of our first
                            efforts in this direction was the establishment of the Delta Omega Rho
                            Beta, the "Delectable Order of the Rag-tag and Bob-tail." We held the
                            initiations at the houses of the "charter members" and the cellar and
                            the coal-vault formed the appropriate setting for our mysteries. We
                            would blindfold the neophyte and tie his hands behind his back, then we
                            would rush him out into the back yard, and round and round the
                            grass-plat with many delusive observations as to the points visited in
                            his pilgrimage. Then we would lower him by a rope down to the coal-hole,
                            where the bandage was removed from his eyes long enough to permit him to
                            see the solemn conclave of masked inquisitors in whose presence he bound
                            himself to the performance of many impossibilities, while a dim light
                            from  the street-lamp streamed directly
                            through a grating upon the blackened face of the Mu Mu Pi (Most Mighty
                            Potentate). Then we would blindfold him again, lead him into the cellar
                            and tumble him over a barrel, typical of his overthrow should he fail in
                            the performance of his obligations. Then we would bump his head against
                            a beam, held just high enough for this purpose, thus giving him visions
                            of the stars to whose heights, if faithful, he was soon to soar (per as pera ad astra). Then we would lay him on a
                            table, take off his shoes and stockings, warm his feet in front of the
                            open furnace door, and leave him to undergo the Sigma Pi Pi or "Solitary
                            Purgatorial Penance," while the inquisitors went up stairs and had "a
                            time" together, descending again after the night had waned with the glad
                            news that the neophyte had been elected to the office of Mu Sigma Alpha
                            in the brotherhood. He was now haled into the light and inducted into
                            the seat of honor, where a sponge recently dipped in ice-water, was
                            prepared for him, and he was at last told the meaning of the mystic
                            letters and informed that he had been chosen the "Most Solemn Ass" in
                            the fraternity.
                        So greatly were we attracted by the delights of secret societies that we
                            organized them everywhere, even in the country where we spent our
                            vacations. There was a great charm in the initiation of yokels who did
                            not understand Latin and Greek and to whom these tongues had a peculiar
                            impressiveness.
                        Among the orders due to our creative fancy, one  for which a great antiquity was immediately acquired, was
                            the E Clampsis Vitus, whose name was taken from that "blessed patron of
                            the dance," as Irving calls him, on account of the strenuous saltatory
                            ceremonies in which the blindfolded neophyte was required to take an
                            active part, being urged thereto by switches rythmatically applied to
                            his bare legs.
                        In these initiations it was sometimes adjudged that the aspirant to the
                            honors of membership was also entitled to the "Grand Propel," a mode of
                            conveyance requiring considerable labor and which was omitted when there
                            was a heavy man upon our hands. The favorite place for such a ceremony
                            was a big barn. The "charter members" arranged themselves in two long
                            rows, close together, and placed the candidate duly bound in a
                            horizontal position between them. Then they projected him from man to
                            man up against the side of the barn with a sharp bump, then back again
                            to the other side, until they were worn out by the exercise. One of the
                            duties of this order was the removal of signboards from the places where
                            they had been located by the misdirected judgment of their owners, and
                            of fixing them in conspicuous positions which we considered more
                            appropriate.
                        There was a little boarding-house down the road, and near by on a tree
                            was a sign-board which gave the following information: "Moxon's Cottag,
                            First Class Board." There was not space enough  left for an "e" in the "Cottage." On Saturday evening
                            while the occupants of the "cottag" were at supper we removed the sign
                            and hid it in some bushes near by. Later, after everybody was asleep, we
                            took it down to the Episcopal Church where we screwed it very firmly and
                            securely to the the front door. The next morning the congregation was
                            astonished at the statement of the new use to which their beautiful
                            edifice was to be devoted. There was much indignation in the
                            neighborhood, but the guilty parties were not discovered, and we always
                            considered that Moxon was our debtor on account of the advertisement we
                            had given his establishment.
                        A butcher's sign with a picture of a purple bull in the act of being
                            slaughtered was fixed to the door of the office of the village doctor
                            and surgeon, while the Quaker meeting-house was ornamented by a sign,
                            informing the public that choice wines and liquors were to be found
                            within.
                        But the richest of our college fraternities was the Alpha Omega Beta or
                            "Ancient Order of Busters," if I may let you into the secret, now that
                            the order is extinct. We had our lodge rooms at Straus' brewery, behind
                            the college, and there were two chapters, the Alpha chapter for Seniors
                            and Sophomores and the Beta chapter for Juniors and Freshmen. There was
                            little furniture in the rooms except the big table and the chairs around
                            it, yet there were certain "properties" which appertained to the two
                            chapters jointly and were quite indispensable  to the proper celebration of our mysteries. For instance
                            there was a stout, thick canvas with places to hold on at the side. This
                            was our blanket for the tossing of the neophytes. When not in use it was
                            generally rolled up on the floor next to the wall, beside a thin, sharp
                            rail, which was applied on appropriate occasions to equestrian
                            exercises. There were other paraphernalia of various kinds, but to me
                            the blanket always seemed to be primus inter pares. It
                            has indeed been greatly distinguished in literature. It plays an
                            important part in one of the most celebrated chapters of Don Quixote,
                            and we find it even in so learned and solemn a book as "Ekkehardt." But
                            no mere literature can quite do justice to the sensations which
                            accompany a good old-fashioned blanket tossing. The only way to learn
                            these is to try itexperientia docet. It is a
                            very odd sensation to feel that you cannot lay hold of anything, that
                            you may grasp and clutch and distort yourself as much as you like, but
                            that your efforts have nothing to do with the position which any of your
                            members may take with reference to any other part of your body, nor with
                            the place which your body occupies in space, nor with the direction
                            toward which it tends. Another curious thing is that the sensation of
                            falling is much more vivid than the sensation of rising. You seem to go
                            down a great deal more than you go up and it is with some surprise that
                            you find after so many long and perilous descents that you are in the
                            very place  where the tossing began. A
                            blanket tossing moreover is unique in the edification which it gives to
                            all those who see it, furnishing, as it does, the greatest possible
                            variety in its transformations of face and posture. If the victim prides
                            himself upon his dignity, if he is one of those solemn wiseacres who is
                            given to looking down with contemptuous benevolence upon the rest of the
                            world, the pleasure derived from his antics is greatly enhanced. To toss
                            a man blindfolded is said to intensify the emotions of the victim, but
                            it certainly detracts from the delight of the bystanders in
                            centemplating the varied play of his features, which is indeed one of
                            the great uses of the entertainment, and might be especially profitable
                            to an artist or a student of physiognomy.
                        Now the A. O. B. was particularly great in this feature of the initiation
                            ceremonies. But we had other important solemnities. We had a baptism,
                            with three glasses of beer "in the name of the A, the O and the B." We
                            had our mystic pass-word "Straus," followed by the appropriate response
                            of "Lager for the Crowd" and one of the Teutonic servitors of the
                            brewery was always close to the neophyte as he uttered this solemn
                            sentence with instructions to bring it up at once. Thereupon a small
                            cask was produced from the cellar, which played the principal part in
                            our concluding ceremonies, until we sometimes engaged in a lively
                            competition on our way home as to who could walk most  unwaveringly on the straight line which
                            divided the flagstones in the middle of the pavement.
                        Our devotions to Bacchus were not all performed within the precincts of
                            Straus' brewery. There were other places where we worshiped and
                            sometimes with ludicrous consequences.
                        One night before he went to Europe, Jones gave a symposium to the boys at
                            the rooms of his fraternity. The punch was good, and when in the small
                            hours he parted from Meek at Union Square, the two embraced each other
                            tenderly, Meek declaring (they had just had their examination in
                            mathematics) that Jones was the diagonal of a parallelopipedon and Meek
                            was the other three sides, a proposition which was then mathematically
                            true.
                        One night I had to see Smithfield home. I knew this was my duty and that
                            Smithfield ought not to be left unprotected. Smithfield, on the other
                            hand, insisted that the trouble was entirely with me. I did not feel
                            quite sure about it myself, yet it did seem to me that
                            Smithfield was doing things which were not quite normal. For instance,
                            he lay upon his back upon the sidewalk and there intoned a peculiar
                            apostrophe to the moon, which was shining brightly over him, concluding
                            with the observation that he had never been so happy in his life. It was
                            not until he was safely within his own door that I proceeded homewards,
                            when my suspicions regarding myself were at last confirmed by a grave
                            process of logic (which shows the inestimable value of this  branch of education) and I proceeded
                            slowly but surely to analyze the situation in the following monologue.
                            "Formerly at the northeast corner of Fifth Avenue and Twenty-ninth
                            Street there was one gaslamp. To-night at the northeast corner of Fifth
                            Avenue and Twenty-ninth Street there are two gaslamps. Now either a new
                            gas-lamp has been put up at the northeast corner of Fifth Avenue and
                            Twentyninth Street, or I have had a drop too much. Quod
                                erat demonstrandum."
                        
                        As no man can properly write a nation's history and leave out of it a
                            description of the budget or the Treasury, so no man can properly
                            describe college life and wholly omit the financial side of it.
                        We were all of us a pretty bad lot in that particular. Norton, who was
                            required by his father to keep an itemized account, put down some large
                            expenditures to Eis Kai Eikosi, telling his father that this was
                            connected with his Greek studies, and indeed it is the Greek equivalent
                            for vingt-et-un, in which the money had been actually
                            disbursed. But Norton pêre, who did business on the stock exchange and
                            had no Achaian environment, was always gratified to know that his hard
                            cash went toward the maintenance of things so classical.
                    
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER III
                        OUR PROFESSORS
                        AMONG our professors, the first face that comes to my
                            memory is the venerable and stately countenance of which I have already
                            spoken. Horace Grandison was the prince of old-fashioned pedagogues.
                            Although our modern instruction is better than the old, and no one wants
                            to bring back the days when the birch and the ferule furnished the
                            incentive to scholarship, yet there were great men among those
                            old-fashioned pedagogueskings by divine right more certainly
                            than many of the monarchs who sit upon great thronesand I view
                            modern progress with half a sigh when I think that such a man as
                            Grandison will never come again. I can see him now, as he used to sit on
                            his high rostrum at the end of his long lecture-room, while the boy who
                            recited sat at the other end and the rest of us were ranged in rows
                            against the side. He was particularly impressive in "Prometheus." While
                            we were reading that great drama it seemed to us as if he himself were
                            one of the gods of the older dynasty, a living protest against Olympian
                            upstarts. What a splendid, broad, high forehead and what gleaming eyes!
                            How well shaven his face, how faultless his old-fashioned collar and
                            black stock!  And what a voice! How rich,
                            full and musical! How incomparable was the Greek tongue when uttered by
                            his lips! He had a translation of his own, a noble one, which we were
                            required to learn by heart. It existed only in manuscript and nobody
                            ever spoke of it to him as his translation, but it was handed down in
                            note books from one class to another, and woe to the poor student who
                            was not the happy possessor of a copy of this manuscript version. Very
                            likely this was not the best way to learn Greek. I am sure it is not
                            taught in this literal fashion at the present time, and yet after many
                            years, when so much that I learned in college is forgotten, how
                            distinctly do the stately sentences of Grandison's translation stand out
                            in my memory! Take for instance the opening passage in the prometheus,
                            where Strength and Force enter with Vulcan to forge the chains of the
                            unfortunate hero:
                        "Now have we come to a far distant spot of earth, to a Scythian tract, to
                            an untrodden wilderness. O Vulcan, it is meet that the mandates which
                            the Father in his good pleasure imposed upon thee, be now a care unto
                            thee, to bind this boldly-wicked one unto the high-precipiced rocks in
                            indissoluble fetters of chains of hardest iron. For having stolen, he
                            has bestowed upon mortals that ornament of thine, the flame of
                            all-art-aiding fire. For such an offense he must needs render an
                            atonement unto the gods in order that he may be taught, if taught he can
                            be, to acquiesce in the sovereignty of Jupiter  and to cease from a disposition full of friendship unto
                            mortals."
                        And again the noble monologue of Prometheus when left alone by his
                            tormentors, written in anapaestic measure, and half spoken, half chanted
                            perhaps behind the heavy mask of the actor in the great theatre of
                            Athens.
                        "O divine ether, and ye breezes, swift of pinion, and fountain-heads of
                            rivers and countless laughter of the ocean waves, I call thee too,
                            Earth, mother of all, behold me, what wrongs I, a god, am suffering at
                            the hands of the gods."
                        How indissolubly do the words of Prometheus and the lips that pronounced
                            them to us to stand together in my recollection, until it is impossible
                            to think of the Greek god with any other features or voice than that of
                            the master by whom they were thus spoken.
                        Grandison was essentially a tyrant, but he was a tyrant great enough to
                            win the love of those whom he oppressed. They said that in his grammar
                            school, in earlier times, he used to whip each day the boy who stood at
                            the foot of the class; not a very fair plan, perhaps, if the poor fellow
                            had done his best, but withal a great provoker to industry and no more
                            relentless than the stripes which mother Nature herself inflicts upon
                            her backward children. He was not altogether just. Like every autocrat
                            he had his favorites, yet the grounds of his choice were so human and
                            manly that we loved him for his very 
                            partiality. A boy once caught in a cowardly action was doomed forever.
                            The conceited fellow was taken down. He could never scan or parse or
                            translate except under the lash of keen sarcasm, while the modest
                            student who "owned up" like a man to trifling derelictions found his
                            path made lighter and easier through the intricacies of Greek
                            construction. Like every other despot the professor was fond of
                            flattery, and we all became, as time went by, a set of rather clumsy
                            courtiers. One of the readiest compliments, a sort of legal tender in
                            the market, was a warm appreciation of the bons mots
                            that issued from the lips of authority. Therefore, the professor's jokes
                            were greeted with an enthusiasm quite out of proportion to their
                            deserts, which were not always of the highest, as witness the following
                            colloquy:
                        
                            Dr. Grandison:
                            "Did you study this passage, sir, before you came to recitation?"
                        
                        
                            Student:
                            "I looked it over, professor."
                        
                        
                            Dr. Grandison:
                            "You mean you overlooked it, sir."
                        
                        Or the following, while a student named Hadley was reciting:
                        
                            Dr. Grandison:
                            "Where did you get that aorist, my young friend?"
                            "In Hadley's grammar, sir."
                            "A very original treatise."
                        
                        The murmurs of admiration which followed such  sallies warmed the good professor's heart, and brought
                            mercy to other delinquents.
                        Another professor who inspired us with almost as much enthusiasm as
                            Grandison was Dr. Piper, our instructor in mathematics. He was a short,
                            stout, round, red-faced man, with sharp, black eyes, careless of his
                            personal appearance, and very awkward in his movements, stumbling over
                            the steps in front of the blackboard, or pitching headlong over our big
                            astronomical globe. He was very irascible and there was a tradition that
                            on one occasion, disdaining to use his official power, he had challenged
                            to personal encounter, then and there before the class, a student who
                            had offended him.
                        He used to denounce us on account of the antiquity and lack of
                            originality of our college pranks. He told us we might make him the
                            subject of any practical joke we chose if it was really new and good,
                            but that "to witness our stale and stupid performances year after year
                            wearied his soul." We respected this view of the matter, and as none of
                            us had the talent to invent an original joke we left him in peace. We
                            felt that he had some right to demand originality from others since he
                            had a large share of that gift himself. He was so eloquent that he could
                            illuminate even the dull field of mathematics with divine light. I
                            remember on one occasion he demonstrated the nebular hypothesis of the
                            solar system. Given the law of gravitation and a vast volume of gaseous
                            matter, distributed irregularly  through
                            space, he traced by mathematical formulæ the course of the chaotic mass,
                            how it must begin to revolve and form great rings and then again to
                            condense into huge spheres until we seemed to see in his glowing imagery
                            the whole process of creation and to stand with the Almighty watching
                            the formation of worlds.
                        Another member of the faculty who always commanded our respect was
                            Prfoessor Wagner, our instructor in ancient history and in Greek and
                            Roman antiquities. The subjects he taught were appropriate, for he was a
                            venerable man with white hair and beard, very thin and very precise,
                            such a man as might properly be the living embodiment of antiquity. But
                            the old gentleman had a sense of dry humor which relieved his prim
                            behavior and excessive conscientiousness, and he had withal a warm and
                            tender heart which revolted at unnecessary punishment for mere youthful
                            pranks. Therefore, we loved him.
                        I remember that once when I was walking to college with George Fletcher,
                            we saw ahead of us a large flock of geese, waddling in a stately manner,
                            with heads aloft, up the avenue. It seemed to us that these geese would
                            be a very appropriate addition to some of the classes of Professor
                            Newman who was always exhorting us to dignified deportment. We resolved,
                            therefore, to drive them into Newman's room. We shooed them up the
                            avenue and around the corner and up the college path, not  without loud protests upon their part.
                            Such a scene offers more than ordinary attractions to the average
                            college boy who happens to have nothing else on his mind, so it was not
                            long before the flock was well guarded upon every side except that
                            toward which they were advancing. We finally collected them into a small
                            area at the foot of the steps leading to Newman's room, but no moral
                            suasion was sufficient to induce them to mount these steps; we had to
                            pick them up one after another and "chuck" them to the landing at the
                            top. This was done amid loud cackling and great outcries. So interesting
                            was the occupation that we did not notice the approach of Dr. Wagner,
                            who now suddenly appeared in our midst. His face was a study, where
                            mingled frown and smile showed the conflicting impulses of duty and
                            inclination.
                        "Gentlemen," he said, with a deprecating wave of the hand, "please
                            desist! Your labor is unnecessary. There are quite enough of these here
                            now."
                        It was a humiliated crowd of boys who now drove these geese back again
                            down the college walk to the avenue. Professor Wagner never referred to
                            the subject afterwards.
                        These were our favorites among the professors. There were others who were
                            indifferent to us and others still who were targets for our pranks.
                        There was Potter for instance. Potter was a sneak and we hated him, yet
                            we had to be careful how we tormented him, for he had sharp eyes and a
                                 vindictive disposition. Our best
                            prank was played one day when an Italian organ-grinder with a monkey
                            came up the college campus. We collected a fund, quite a large one, from
                            our slender allowances, to be paid to the organ-grinder if he would open
                            the door of Potter's room, while a class was reciting, enter the room,
                            play upon the organ, and let the monkey out to the limit of his tether.
                            The payments were arranged according to a scheme of arithmetical
                            progression. For opening the door and commencing, he was to have a
                            quarter; for playing for one minute, before he was turned out, he was to
                            have a dollar; for two minutes, five dollars; three minutes, ten
                            dollars, and five minutes, twenty dollars. And one of us sat at the
                            other end of the corridor with watch in hand to mark the time. Spurred
                            by this unwonted stimulus, the organ-grinder opened the door, entered,
                            and began his diabolical strains. He was ordered out, but being an
                            Italian, how could he understand? We heard the uproar inside the room
                            and the loud voice of Potter commanding order. The Italian was
                            imperturbable and the organ was well in the third stanza of "Santa
                            Lucia" when, in the midst of a perfect pandemonium, the professor came
                            down from the rostrum and in a single handed combat, worthy of divine
                            hexameters, finally ejected the Italian who had now earned ten dollars,
                            an expenditure which we considered the best investment we had ever made
                            of that amount of money.
                        But though we hated Potter, our worst blows fell  upon poor Sheldon. Sheldon had written a number of
                            articles for the religious press, exposing with caustic severity the
                            errors of Rome. Somebody had conceived the opinion that this was the
                            sort of man needed for the teaching of history as "she should be
                            taught," and in an evil hour Sheldon was appointed to superintend our
                            historical researches. He was a mild-mannered little man with scanty
                            knowledge of the world and absolutely none of that part of the world
                            which was represented by irreverent college boys. We used to make life a
                            heavy burden to him. We had a choice assortment of paper monkeys,
                            elephants, giraffes and everything else that might go into a menagerie,
                            which we attached to putty-balls and projected up to the ceiling where
                            they stuck. Sometimes just before we entered the lecture-room one of us
                            would stand outside the door with a bottle of Shaker snuff, a peculiarly
                            strong variety, and each would take a big pinch. The result was that all
                            further proceedings except sneezing became impossible. We would go into
                            convulsions which actually aroused the sympathy of the poor professor,
                            who could not imagine what evil thing had over-taken us.
                        Another favorite amusement was to throw a hen into the room during
                            examination and then assist the professor in a wild chase after the
                            terrified fowl.
                        On one occasion a noble opportunity presented itself of tormenting
                            Sheldon and Crawdle both at the same time. Crawdle was a little
                            pale-faced  student who was preparing
                            himself for the clerical profession. He was too good for earth, so we
                            did our best to send him at an early date into the mansions prepared for
                            the righteous. One day a big, doleful cow-bell was found and tied to a
                            long string running over the benches back to the place wherè Crawdle
                            sat. The real culprit occupied a seat right in front of the professor,
                            so that nobody could suspect him. As soon as the fellow who was reciting
                            had fairly begun his account of the schism in the church, the bell began
                            and Sheldon looked up in astonishment.
                        "Mr. Crawdle, what have you got there?"
                        "I don't know, sir."
                        Evidently that must be a lie. Crawdle was called up next and in his
                            confusion he didn't know the difference between the 39 Articles and the
                            West-minster Confession. So he was sent back to his seat and a zero was
                            placed against his name. No sooner had he reached his seat than the bell
                            began again, whereupon poor Crawdle was called upon to report to the
                            faculty at one o'clock Friday afternoonthe day and hour at
                            which our criminal assizes and jail-delivery took place. But still the
                            bell continued. The whole class turned upon Crawdle with looks of
                            disapprobation. "Shame! Shame!" we cried, but the bell kept up its
                            monotonous jargon. Finally the professor ran from his rostrum and made a
                            dash for the corner where Crawdle was sitting. The fellow in front now
                                 pulled the string so sharply that it
                            broke close to the bell. There was one loud jangle and then silence, and
                            the bell was found right under Crawdle's seat and borne by the professor
                            as spolia opima up to his desk.
                        At the faculty meeting on Friday, Crawdle protested his ignorance of the
                            whole transaction, but it was of no use. Two warnings and two
                            admonitions was the sentence. The system in vogue at the college was
                            this: Three admonitions were equal to one warning, and after three
                            warnings you had to go. So Crawdle stood just on the edge of the
                            precipice during the rest of the four years. We knew it was good for
                            him. Tribulation would qualify him for heaven as well as for his sacred
                            calling.
                        Crawdle was not the only poor wight to whom we did good against his will.
                            When the entrance examinations were held in June we got possession of
                            one of the lecture-rooms and organized a new department of our own.
                            Epworth, who wore eye-glasses and had more gray hairs than any of the
                            rest of us, the result of early piety, as he declared, was duly
                            installed as professor of English literature. And the youngest looking
                            fellows of our class were pressed into the service as decoy ducks,
                            engaged in passing their entrance examinations. Then we went to the
                            genuine candidates and told them they had to be examined in English
                            literature, that it was a new requirement just adopted by the faculty,
                                 that it was not intended that any
                            special preparation should be made upon this subject, but the
                            examination was merely to test the intelligence and general information
                            of the candidates. As each victim entered the room he saw a number of
                            boys who were presumably taking examinations. Epworth sat on the rostrum
                            with his eye-glasses on, looking very fierce. As soon as one of the
                            decoy ducks had finished his supposed examination the novice was called
                            to the chair. "Give me the names of all poets and dramatists of the
                            Restoration, together with a list of the principal works of each!" After
                            the wretched being had stammered something about Shakespeare, Milton, or
                            Byron, he was suddenly told, "That is enough, sir. You will study this
                            subject thoroughly during the summer months and present yourself again
                            for examination in the fall." And the trembling aspirant for college was
                            forthwith sent out of the room.
                        Of course it was good for him. We all knew that. How much better to spend
                            his vacation in the useful pursuit of knowledge than in vain and
                            frivolous pastimes! And if he came again in the fall and was not
                            examined at all, he would know that much more and he might thank us for
                            it.
                        Perhaps poor Newman had the worst time of all the professors. We used to
                            lock him in the lecture-room and then sympathetically offer to help him
                            leap down from the window to the hard pavement twelve feet below.
                        
                        One of us brought up a bottle of assafoetida, and Norton threw it on the
                            stove, whereupon there was a general exodus from the room, nobody
                            remaining except the professor himself and two or three of the faithful,
                            who were rewarded for their constancy by a headache. We were summoned
                            before the faculty the following Friday, but so eloquently did we plead
                            our cause and insist upon our natural right to avoid the headache, so
                            strongly did we denounce the wretch who brought the vile substance to
                            the college that we were not only acquitted, but Prex apologized for
                            having summoned us at all.
                        Newman was particularly unfortunate in uttering inappropriate sarcasms
                            and threats which he could never make good.
                        "Pleased with a rattle, tickled with a straw!" was one of his favorite
                            quotations after some of our puerilities. It was a sentiment always
                            greeted with unanimous applause.
                        "If I could catch the fellow who did that, I would take him by the back
                            of the neck and kick him downstairs." But as poor Newman could never
                            catch anybody at anything, and if he had done so could never have kicked
                            the smallest boy in the class anywhere, the terror inspired by his
                            threat was greatly softened by the impossibility of performance.
                        Another professor who stands ut distinctly in memory, but in quite
                            another way, was our professor of German, to whom a tense or mood or
                            some remote  allusion was of far more
                            importance than the dramatic power of the author he was elucidating. For
                            years he deprived himself of society and undermined his constitution in
                            a strenuous effort to demonstrate the meaning of Gthe's
                            "homunculus" in the second part of "Faust" in opposition to a heretical
                            commentator across the seas. For a whole generation they contended in
                            erudite articles appearing about a year apart. One day the professor
                            came to us with despair written upon every feature. "What do you suppose
                            has happened?" he said, "Richter is dead, and he died just before the
                            publication of my answer to his absurd contention in the in the
                            Zeitgeist." We sympathized deeply with the professor and told him that
                            the rest of the world was still open to conviction.
                    
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER IV
                        OUR ESCAPADES
                        BUT we were not content to play pranks upon the
                            professors; even Prex himself was the object of our irreverent practical
                            jokes.
                        President Fielding was an old gentleman of benevolent instincts and
                            extraordinary attainments, skilled in all branches of knowledge, very
                            hard of hearing, and of a fatal facility of speech. The good doctor was
                            especially strong upon questions of ethics and propriety, just those
                            things which, as it appeared to us, we did not need to know at all.
                            Moreover he seemed to think that the efficacy of his admonitions was
                            measured by their length. If then, we wanted to avoid the first lecture
                            in the morning, all we had to do was to start up trouble in chapel, for
                            we knew that Prex would begin a homily upon the elements of gentlemanly
                            behavior and that when he once commenced he would fall under the charm
                            of his own sentences and would not stop short of an hour. Many were the
                            times when moral instruction that was little heeded took the place of
                            the studies set down in the curriculum.
                        During our senior year, Prex gave us a series of lectures upon the
                            evidences of natural and revealed religion, but his "Ontological
                            argument" had few  charms for us when put
                            in competition with "Landlord, Fill the Flowing Bowl," or "We won't go
                            Home till Morning," with which the class glee club simultaneously
                            entertained us without any suspicion on the part of the worthy
                            president, who was deaf to everything except the music of the
                            spheres.
                        But even Prex was hardly large enough game for our ambitious spirits, so
                            once we determined to play a practical joke upon the whole faculty
                            together in chapel. The professors and president sat inside a railed
                            platform at one end of the room, something like a chancel, while the
                            chaplain conducted the services from a small, high reading-desk in the
                            middle of this platform. To reach it, the faculty had to pass down
                            through the middle of the chapel from the door at the opposite end,
                            while the students arranged themselves on the benches at each side. On
                            one occasion we provided ourselves with a large quantity of percussion
                            caps, which we scattered down the middle aisle where the professors
                            passed, and which we also distributed liberally over the entire platform
                            and reading-desk. We entered chapel very early that morning, took our
                            places quietly at each side, and then waited to see the sport.
                        Hepworth, the chaplain, came in first, followed by the president leading
                            the procession of the faculty. "Crack! Crack!" sounded the percussion
                            caps, and "Jump! Jump!" this way and then that, sprang the professors.
                            It was with flushed face and looks of 
                            uncontrollable anger that Hepworth sought divine grace on that memorable
                            morning.
                        One day after lectures were over, Smithfield came to me (Smithfield is
                            now on the bench of the Supreme Court) and said: "Dillingham, there is a
                            donkey for sale, a very little one, in the stable just around the
                            corner. What can we do with him?" I suggested, "Let us bring him over
                            early in the morning and lift him on the flag-staff."
                        A syndicate was formed to raise the purchase money and we procured the
                            necessary tackle. Early the following morning half a dozen of us
                            appeared with our long-eared friend behind the college. Pierre, the
                            deputy janitor, was bribed to open the back door, and then not to know
                            what happened. It was no easy task to lug the kicking beast up the steep
                            stairways, but what will not youthful enthusiasm accomplish when
                            animated by a lofty purpose? A strong cloth was placed under his body to
                            make him comfortable. He was then attached to the rope of the flag-staff
                            and slowly elevated, swinging around the pole, as he went up, first on
                            one side and then on the other. At last when he was near the top we tied
                            the rope and quietly descended. It was nearly an hour before prayers.
                            When we entered chapel the donkey was still unperceived by any member of
                            the faculty. After prayers were over, instead of going to our recitation
                            rooms we assembled on the campus in front of the college buildings and
                            Norton, mounted on the back of  Egbert,
                            the biggest man in the college proposed three cheers for our "Banner in
                            the Sky." The cheers were given with a will. Suddenly Prex appeared. He
                            bustled down to us, his silk gown flapping in the wind.
                        "Gentlemen, what are you doing here? Pass to your lecture rooms."
                        Our only answer was to point to the flag-staff. Our honored president
                            looked up and saw the swaying beast with legs kicking ineffectually in
                            the air. Just at that moment the silence which his asininity had
                            hitherto preserved was broken, and with his long neck stretched forth,
                            "the ass opened his mouth and he spake."
                        A dozen men and two hours' time were required to bring the donkey down
                            from the lofty eminence to which half the hands and half the time had
                            been enough to elevate him. Such is the power of inspiration! Not one
                            word was ever said to us about the incident by those in authority.
                        Were, then, our escapades the main features of our college life? I
                            confess they stand out more distinctly in my remembrance than anything
                            else. But a good many of us did a lot of hard work and with a curious
                            kind of false pride we did it as secretly as possible. I took great
                            pains to be seen on the Avenue in the afternoon, in the rooms of our
                            secret society at night, and afterwards perhaps at a ball, so that it
                            might easily be known of all that I performed no labor. Then I would
                            rise at  five o'clock in the morning and
                            work like an ant. But I told no one of this, and if the recitation was
                            well done it was easy to see that this was the result of pure genius and
                            not at all due to toil. We disdained all servile labor!
                        Once I had been selected to make one of the "orations" at the opera house
                            on the occasion of the anniversary of our Philologian Society. (If the
                            president addresses the people in words forever to be remembered, it is
                            merely a "speech," but the flowery platitudes of the college boy are
                            embodied in an "oration.") I worked at that "oration" harder than I
                            would have chosen to confess, and although it was carefully committed to
                            memory, I was determined that the audience should see in it nothing but
                            the extemporaneous product of the divine fire. What better device for
                            this purpose than an exordium referring to the weather? Anybody could
                            tell that an appropriate remark on that subject must be spontaneous!
                            Cicero, I had heard, prepared different introductions for his orations
                            and shifted them around as occasion suited. Such an example was worthy
                            of imitation. So I prepared twoone for fine weather and
                            another for bad weather. The night turned out to be a fair one. I am not
                            able to say how successful were those subtle efforts in convincing my
                            hearers that my carefully rounded periods were due to the immediate
                            inspiration of their presence. But of one thing at least I am persuaded,
                            and that is that a good many  of the
                            sparks of genius in really meritorious productions have been struck,
                            like my pitiful imitation, from the anvil of hard work. The real
                            discredit is not in the labor, but in the false shame which refuses to
                            own it.
                        What a coxcomb does a young man become when he goes to a college filled
                            with rich men's sons? Lucky is he who has even the ambition to work in
                            secret, stolen moments which he will not confess. For myself, I had a
                            distinct enjoyment as well as ambition in literary work, though I
                            stifled the expression of it; and I projected in secret great
                            enterprises almost as elaborate as the "Conquest of Peru."
                        Among other things, I saw the dramatic possibilities of Sallust's
                            "Jugurtha" and commenced to write a "tragedy" of that name. I had been
                            much impressed with a recent reading given by Fannie Kemble of "Richard
                            III." and especially with the opening soliloquy. My drama was to begin
                            in the same way, with the following monologue by Jugurtha:
                        
                            "Now hath Micipsa to the royal house
                            Called me in haste, and if the rank reports
                            That grow so thick, are rooted deep in fact,
                            The king can live no longer than the night.
                            Therefore he sends for me who seek his throne,
                            (He knows it well) to wheedle and cajole
                            Into some unripe promise of my love
                            For his poor puny sonswhom still I hate
                            And will destroy, if fortune aids my plan,
                            And seize and hold alone their father's throne."
                        
                        
                        This started off, I thought, pretty well, but a friend
                            calledthere was a theatre party that night, next week came the
                            examinations, the divine afflatus was dissipated, and the drama went no
                            further. Ah! if all the fine projects of the world could attain their
                            consummation, what a world it would be! There would be no need of
                            beckoning us on to any better one.
                    
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER V
                        ALBERT VISCONTI
                        PERHAPS the most potent factor in my transformation at
                            college into a scapegrace was my friendship with Albert Visconti.
                            College friendship often becomes an intimacy which is, perhaps, next to
                            marriage, the closest in the world, yet these friendships are generally
                            determined more by accident than by the selection of discerning
                            judgment. It was in this way that my acquaintance with Visconti first
                            began. He was in the class above me and I can remember the ringing
                            cheers with which he led his classmates against us in the college rush
                            on an occasion when I had to send for a new suit of clothes before I
                            could go home. It was natural enough that anybody should be attracted
                            toward his handsome face. His fine forehead, dark, waving hair, and
                            deep, expressive eyes, were more fascinating to me than any I had ever
                            seen. It was he who, in a walk one afternoon, induced me to join the
                            Sigma Taus, and after I had been received into the fold, he regarded me
                            as his personal property. He had taken this inexperienced Quaker boy
                            under his wing and proposed to train his protégé very carefully in the
                            way he should not go. For a long time he succeeded
                            admirably. He initiated me into the mysteries of  the game of poker. He took me with a small party to a
                            burlesque one night where we occupied a proscenium box and where the
                            leading actress, Mademoiselle Geraldine sang a song especially in our
                            honor. She was pretty and danced charmingly, and it all seemed
                            delightfully wicked and pleasant. He even offered to introduce me behind
                            the scenes, and to get me a part where I was to do no speaking, but was
                            to come in with some French noblemen, as a spectator of one of Mlle.
                            Geraldine's performances. He told me that he had several times taken the
                            part of the Chevalier de Maurepin, whose duty it was to hand her a
                            letter during a critical episode of the play. But I was too timid to go,
                            though I looked upon him with envy as one dwelling upon inaccessible
                            heights of happiness. After that evening he called me his violet and
                            said I bloomed beautifully and modestly in the shade. Never was there a
                            feudal baron that received more devoted homage from his faithful vassal
                            than Visconti did from me. He was indeed a shining object of homage, for
                            whether he was humming a song or rehearsing a speech for one of our
                            anniversaries, or devising some madcap prank upon the faculty, life was
                            always brighter when he was by. He did not stand high in his class, but
                            the things he knew and the accomplishments he possessed outside of the
                            curriculum were astonishing. He was a fine musician; he seemed almost an
                            expert in matters of art and general literature; he had traveled
                            extensively; he  talked French and Italian
                            and there was no game at which he was not proficient. For all these
                            things I admired him the more since I was decidedly backward in
                            accomplishments. This was especially true as to our college sports. When
                            the baseball nines were chosen from the bystanders, I was always about
                            the seventh man called out on our side, and had the comfort of knowing
                            that there were perhaps two fellows who were even worse players than I.
                            In football I was in like manner about three-fourths of the way down the
                            list, though I improved greatly as time went by.
                        Arthur, on the other hand, was sure to be the first man chosen. He was
                            the fastest runner and could kick the ball the furthest, and he was the
                            best oarsman and the most skilful boxer in his class. He was, therefore,
                            my model as to all the delightful and ornamental things of life. It was
                            to him that I owed my initiation into the mysteries of the art of
                            self-defense, for he induced me to take lessons in boxing from his own
                            instructor, Billy Baxter, the celebrated "champion lightweight." These
                            lessons went on swimmingly so long as the champion only touched me with
                            the back of his hand, and I thought I was learning to guard and strike
                            with great dexterity, but when the hard knocks came and the tears
                            started, I instinctively adopted a method of attack and defense which is
                            not generally approved by authorities on this noble artI shut
                            my eyes firmly and rushed with great fury upon my opponent.  Strange as it may seem, the shelter which
                            I thus found in closing the organs of vision, proved to be of the most
                            transitory character, and after being well pounded half a dozen times, I
                            was compelled to resort to other expedients. One thing I noticed which
                            greatly surprised methat a man's skill with his fists depended
                            much upon his mood, and the absence of other distractions. Once while I
                            was boxing with Visconti during one of our summer vacations, he had much
                            the better me, until a very pretty girl, who was a guest at the same
                            hotel where we were staying, came suddenly upon us. This girl had smiled
                            upon Visconti and he was more than eager to show his skill in her
                            presence. So anxious was he that he struck wildly and took no care of
                            his guard, and I had the satisfaction of laying him out in the presence
                            of the fair one, who, soon after, left us with a look of disappointment
                            on her face, whereupon Visconti, now free from embarrassment, but
                            greatly exasperated at the showing he had made in her presence,
                            proceeded to thrash me as he had never done before.
                        I often visited him at his house and it was by degrees that I became
                            acquainted with his family history. He was, as his name would indicate,
                            the son of a gentleman of Italian ancestry. His father was a man of
                            broad culture, high attainments, quiet and courtly manners, who had been
                            the proprietor of a large plantation in Louisiana, and whose absolute
                            dominion over several hundred slaves had accentuated  his naturally despotic and cruel nature.
                            Albert was his only son and, although in a way the father was attached
                            to the boy and took great pains with his education, yet Mr. Visconti's
                            notions of parental authority were those that prevailed upon the
                            continent. He had been somewhat wild in his youth but had reformed
                            terribly, so that he regarded as little less than crimes in others, and
                            particularly in his son, the things which had been daily occurrences in
                            his own early life. He required instant obedience to every word and
                            gesture; the boy had to rise whenever his father entered the room and
                            remain standing until otherwise directed. He was placed under the care
                            of a tutor, was forbidden to form any acquaintances whatever outside the
                            family, and was severely punished for the slightest short-comings. Thus
                            life became a sort of perpetual imprisonment, until at last the boy
                            resolved to break away from a constraint which had become unendurable.
                            One night he fled from the plantation, but the dogs were put upon his
                            track and when next day he was captured and brought home, he was flogged
                            by his father almost as mercilessly as if he had been one of the negroes
                            in the field.
                        Albert's mother, who belonged to an old Creole family, was a lady of
                            considerable beauty, graceful bearing, easy disposition and infinite
                            tact, one of the few human beings who could have borne without an open
                            rupture the daily trials caused by her husband's overbearing
                            disposition. Mr. Visconti had  come to New
                            York for a few years to take charge of an enterprise connected with the
                            refining of sugar, in which a number of the Louisiana planters had
                            become interested, and while in that city he had sent his son to a
                            preparatory school to fit him for college. But the discipline of his
                            household was almost as strict as in Louisiana, a footman accompanied
                            the boy each morning to school and went in the afternoon to fetch him
                            home, a proceeding which subjected Albert to much ridicule at the hands
                            of his fellow pupils. He was still forbidden to make acquaintances, and
                            although he secretly stole out of the bounds prescribed whenever his
                            father's eyes were not fastened upon him, yet this continual espionage
                            finally engenedered a feeling of deep hatred toward the parent who had
                            mistreated him.
                        During Albert's freshman year at college his father died, but there was
                            little sorrow in the household at this event. The mother and son, if
                            they did not say it, felt that a weight had been taken off their lives.
                            To Albert, most of all, the change was welcome. A life of continual
                            restraint became transformed into a life of reckless
                            libertyfor his mother, easy-going soul that she was, had no
                            heart to refuse anything to her only son. He now embarked on a career
                            wilder than that of any of his companions. Brilliant as he was, his
                            company was sought everywhere, and after a brief period of merely formal
                            mourning, which scarcely concealed the joy of his deliverance, he became
                            the center of every party of  pleasure.
                            His graceful figure, dashing presence and dark, magnetic eyes, made him
                            an object of very dangerous attraction to womenover whom he
                            had a singular power, a power of which he was well aware, and which he
                            was not at all scrupulous in using. He made me a confidant in the
                            details of some of his escapades, several of which were going on at the
                            same time, but although I listened to him with far greater tolerance
                            than I ought to have done and even took a minor part in one or two of
                            his more innocent adventures, by making myself as agreeable as I could
                            to "the other girl," who was sometimes an inconvenient appendage, yet on
                            the whole he did not find me sufficiently sympathetic in his more
                            serious intrigues, and he gradually ceased to talk with me on the
                            subject, until I began to imagine he was through sowing the worst of his
                            wild oats. There was, however, a darker side to his character, a trait
                            of which I was then entirely ignorant. He never gave way to sudden
                            outbreaks of passion or resentment, and had therefore the reputation of
                            being tolerant, generous and kind-hearted, although somewhat careless of
                            the feelings of others. This estimate was far from the fact. He was
                            indeed not easily offended, but when once satisfied that he had suffered
                            an affront, made no sign, but quietly stored away the incident for use
                            when an opportunity for retribution should occur. The affront remained
                                alta mente repostum, until perhaps years
                            afterward, when everybody else had forgotten it,  he would deliver some crushing blow to the man who had
                            slighted or provoked him. This morbid, calculating instinct was at such
                            variance with his apparent geniality and thoughtlessness in other things
                            that none of us suspected that he had it. We could not understand, for
                            instance, how it was that Melville was defeated for class orator by the
                            single casting vote of Visconti, a man of his own set, until some one
                            remembered that two years before, Melville had left his friend out of a
                            certain pic-nic party on account of a trifling scandal that had become
                            current at that time. When Purdy was up for appointment before the
                            trustees as an instructor, it was found that serious charges had been
                            preferred against him, and upon inquiry it was learned that these had
                            been indirectly instigated by Visconti. Nobody could understand the
                            motive for this conduct until it was remembered that once in his
                            freshman year at a symposium, Purdy referred to a rather discreditable
                            incident connected with Visconti, in a remark which was at the time
                            treated by the latter as a mere pleasantry. Thus one circumstance after
                            another revealed the dark trait in his character to those who had been
                            his admirers and shattered the idol they had made of him, so that when
                            he graduated there were very few except myself who still wholly believed
                            in him and trusted him. As I see it now, it was astonishing how many
                            opportunities he found to get even with those who had offended him, and
                            equally astonishing how, in the mere getting  even, he had done himself a greater injury than any he had
                            ever suffered from others. But at that time, in spite of the warnings of
                            my associates, I never doubted him. He had a strong touch of the
                            dramatic in his character. When he told us a story it was sure to
                            contain some sudden and startling denouement or to be filled with some
                            kind of poetic nemesis. I think this tendency of his mind was closely
                            connected with his hunger for revenge and that both, together with his
                            romantic and sentimental nature, were part of his inheritance from the
                            father who had also educated him, through a long course of tyranny, into
                            the skilful suppression and concealment of his deepest purposes. But
                            although the most serious blemish in his character did not become
                            apparent to any of us until the latter part of his college course, and
                            to some of us not until after he had graduated, yet there was another
                            shortcoming which we all criticized, though we were ourselves in less
                            degree tarred with the same stick and therefore could not consider it a
                            capital offense. That was the outrageous manner in which he led his fond
                            mother by the nose, and beguiled her into giving him large allowances
                            and making considerable expenditures on his behalf. Every summer he had
                            to go abroad. There were philogical researches, he told her, in which he
                            was deeply interested, and in which it was necessary for him to consult
                            foreign libraries and to confer with certain specialists, though when he
                            had gone he quite forgot these studies, but led  instead a butterfly life at the French capital, and when
                            he had spent his all in pleasure or at the gaming table, he would
                            telegraph home some ingenious reasons (which were always accepted) for
                            replenishing his exhausted treasury. These demands upon his mother's
                            resources were far more than she could afford, and it was for this
                            reason that we, who sinned ourselves in the same way, at last found
                            fault with him.
                    
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER VI
                        A SUMMER IN EUROPE
                        AT the end of my junior year (Albert had just
                            graduated), he asked me to go with him on his usual summer trip abroad.
                            My parents concented, and we started together on the Urania, at that time one of the most popular steamers on the
                            ocean. At the end of the dining table where Albert and I sat, was a fine
                            looking man who was traveling with his wife and two daughters. The
                            eldest of these, who sat next to my friend, was a grave, dark-eyed,
                            beautiful girl, a little shy, a little my senior in age, who gave me
                            from the moment I saw her, the impression of that high breeding in which
                            a few of our American women rival and perhaps excel even those of noble
                            birth and extensive accomplishments abroad. On the opposite side of the
                            table, next to Mr. Day (for this, as I soon found, was the name of the
                            gentleman), was his wife, a tall, quiet lady, whose few locks of gray
                            intermingled with her dark brown hair seemed to give added dignity and
                            charm to a face which was distinguished rather than beautiful. At her
                            side, nearly opposite me, was the younger daughter, with mischievous
                            blue eyes, merry red lips and ripples of golden hair that seemed to have
                            a laughter in them like the waves. It was a face which fairly  startled me with its dazzling brilliancy.
                            I was especially anxious not to give sign of weakness in such a
                            presence, and deep was my humiliation when, just before dessert, after
                            all hope was over and I rose to stagger toward the door, I saw her eyes
                            upon me with an expression which showed perhaps a little pity, but far
                            more amusement. Dorothy and her father were the only ones who remained
                            with Albert at our table until the end of the meal.
                        Luckily my seasickness was of short duration and the charm of the new
                            life with its wealth of sunshine and sparkling light reflected from the
                            crests of every wave, began to grow upon me. We soon came to know the
                            Days quite well, and Dorothy and I became great friends. She had always
                            a smile for me and seemed very cordial, but I soon found that the
                            pleasure she appeared to take in my companionship was mainly for the
                            purpose of tormenting me. There was much instruction I acquired in that
                            first voyage, quite as much as a freshman at college ever receives from
                            a sophomore, and much of it came from Dorothy herself, for she had been
                            abroad before and although young in years, was much my senior in
                            nautical information. One day I thought I would like to climb the mast,
                            and Dorothy being by, encouraged me, and said she only wished she could
                            go too, that the ship and the passengers and the sea itself must look
                            beautiful from so fine a point of observation. So I scrambled up the
                            ropes as far as I could. She looked at me 
                            with interest and I enjoyed what seeemed to be her admiration. The sight
                            was indeed a curious one from the masthead as it swung to and fro. I saw
                            the passengers far below me walking like pigmies up and down the deck.
                            The steamer was far longer and narrower than I had supposed, and seemed
                            to cut the water like a knife. But I noticed that Dorothy had gone
                            forward to the forecastle and had spoken to one of the seamen, and now
                            that she was returning and looking up at me in great delight, what was
                            my surprise to see half a dozen sailors climbing swiftly up the ropes
                            toward me. At first I thought they had been directed to follow me by the
                            officer on duty through an unnecessary regard for my safety. It was no
                            doubt a well meant, though very mistaken act of kindness, but I was soon
                            surprised to see that each one had brought with him two or three strong
                            cords, and after they reached me, still greater was my astonishment,
                            when they began to tie me fast. One of them got hold of each wrist and
                            one of each ankle. Spreading my limbs as far apart as possible they
                            bound me to the ropes and descended to the deck leaving me there alone,
                            trussed up like a chicken to enjoy the scenery at my leisure, intimating
                            as they went the amount of ransom necessary for my liberation.
                        By this time I was full of fury and ready to die rather than capitulate.
                            Luckily for me, one of the sailors had done his work badly, my right
                            wrist was soon free, whereupon I disengaged the other and  then my feet. As soon as they saw what I
                            was doing they came after me again, but my rage lent agility to my
                            muscles. I cared little what became of me, but they should not get me. I
                            escaped them, got on the inside of the ropes and took a long leap for
                            the deck, amid the applause of the passengers, who had gathered around
                            to see the outcome of my adventure. Dorothy was there, too, to
                            compliment me on my skill in jumping. At first I was so indignant I
                            would have nothing to say to her, for of course, I knew that the little
                            minx had been at the bottom of all my discomfiture. But where is the
                            youth that can long resist such eyes when they smile upon him? After a
                            day or two of awkward surliness, I made up with her and was soon bound
                            again in the toils. Dorothy did not in the least mind it if she was
                            herself the victim of a practical joke. On one occasion, when we went
                            down together to the stokers' room to see the big, grimy fellows shovel
                            the coal into the furnaces, some one suddenly appeared just outside the
                            door and closed it, locking us securely in. The heat was stifling, but
                            Dorothy threw her cloak upon a pile of coal in the corner and quietly
                            sat down prepared to hold out indefinitely. This time it was I who
                            offered to capitulate, but she would not let me, so there we stayed
                            until the watch sounded and the new men came to relieve those who were
                            at work. These seamen's pranks, and the custom of imposing fines upon
                            unwary landsmen who venture into parts of 
                            the ship where they have no business to go, are now a thing of the
                            past.
                        Albert and Ethel, the elder sister, were much together. They were fond of
                            going to the forecastle and leaning over the side of the vessel to watch
                            the sharp prow cleaving the water and see the phosphorescent glow around
                            the ship at night. If Dorothy cared for such things, for the great waves
                            and the sky and the long, bright pathway of the moon upon the ocean, she
                            certainly never let me find it out; it was the doings of the officers
                            and crew and passengers that appeared to furnish her with the greatest
                            delight, the authoritative way in which Captain Hawkins read the prayers
                            on Sunday, as though God were "aloft" and it would not be good for Him
                            if He didn't do what He was told to; the agony of the man from Boston
                            who roared the responses with both eyes shut and with an expression
                            indicative of colic; the grim resolution of the old Scotchman who walked
                            backward and forward, backward and forward on the deck the livelong day
                            like a wild beast in a cage; the convincing power of the traveler
                            returning from California who produced a long cord in proof of the
                            immense circumference of the big trees in Calaveras which he had
                            measured; the imprudence of the lady from Philadelphia who wanted to see
                            a storm and when it came asked in despair: "Why do people ever go to
                            sea?" the danger of explosion to the red-faced Englishman who became
                            suffocated with his own  jokes before he
                            could reach the point in telling them, and who wanted to be Julius
                            Caesar in charades the last evening on board, but became incapacitated
                            through laughter at the idea.
                        When we disembarked at Queenstown, our plans and the Days' took us at
                            first to the same places, and soon it seemed so natural to be together,
                            that as they appeared willing to have us, we traveled in their company
                            most of the summer. To Ethel's dreamy nature the beauties of Killarney,
                            the bright green of the mountain sides, the ivied ruins, the long echoes
                            that answered the high notes as we rowed across the lakes afforded
                            infinite delight, and Albert, whose disposition was romantic and
                            dramatic to the last degree, found in her a sympathetic spirit which
                            responded spontaneously to his enthusiasms. He had plain sailing; but as
                            for me, I had a harder time with Dorothy, who never let me see that she
                            admired the scenery, the ruins and the sunsets, but who was forever
                            laughing at the absurdity of a country where everybody you met was an
                            Irishman, where almost every horse was a donkey, where the women rode to
                            market sitting on the calf or pig, where the cats were so human, the
                            children so uncanny that you couldn't quite tell at night whether the
                            cry came from a cat or a baby, and where every large and commodious
                            building was a Bedlam! One day, when our coach was passing a
                            particularly imposing structure, she offered to wager that it was a
                            madhouse. Thinking we had  seen so many
                            there was no likelihood of more, I denied it, we referred the matter to
                            the coachman, and when I asked: "Is that large building an insane
                            asylum?" he answered: "No, sir! it is not, sir." Here my face glowed
                            with momentary triumph. "It is a lunatic asylum, sir!" And Dorothy's
                            voice rang clearest in laughter at my discomfiture. A trait that greatly
                            amused her was the Hibernian's unwillingness to admit that there was
                            anything he did not know. Once as we stopped close to a curious ruined
                            tower, Dorothy asked me to inquire of a peasant who stood near what it
                            might be. Pat took off his hat, bowed, looked bewildered, scratched his
                            head, and solemnly replied: "Well, sir, you've studied history, sir, and
                            I've studied history, but we can't account for that, sir!" and the
                            little baggage pursed her lips in mock sympathy at our mutual but
                            ineffectual researches. We passed a mountain one day where, as the
                            coachman told us, there were 365 little lakes, one for each day of the
                            year. Ethel was much interested in the coincidence, but Dorothy gravely
                            asked him whether a new lake came every leap-year. When we passed over
                            into England and visited some of the historical monuments there, she was
                            even more irreverent. What appeared to attract her most in the
                            cathedrals were the penitential seats from which a monk was projected
                            headlong if he sought to comfort himself with a nap during the services,
                            the grotesque carvings on the choir stalls where the big pig plays the
                                 bagpipe and the little pigs dance,
                            where the whale swallows Jonah and then casts him forth on dry land.
                        When we reached Paris she found infinite opportunities for diversion in
                            the attempts of some of our fellow Americans to make themselves
                            understood in a language which no one could comprehend. There was Mr.
                            Jones, for example, whose practice was to repeat all he said in English
                            at the top of his voice, it being a well-known principle that no
                            language is unintelligible if you will only speak it loud enough. There
                            was Mrs. Grubbs on the floor just below us, whom Dorothy detected in an
                            effort to explain to the chambermaid by scrubbing on an imaginary
                            washboard, that she had some clothes to be laudered; there was Grubbs
                            gesticulating to a cabman and wildly revolving his arms in the air, as
                            indication that he wanted to go to the railway station, whereupon cabby
                            with a smile of intelligence drove him to a shop where they sold
                            velocipedes.
                        At a German swimming-school, where we saw a boy sprawling on the water at
                            the end of what seemed a huge fish-line attached to a pole held by his
                            instructor, and learning the motions of the swimmer in regular
                                rhythmeins-zwei-drei,
                            eins-zweidreishe suggested the advantages of having to
                            eat and drink in the same methodical manner. In Switzerland I thought,
                            with despair, that she cared less for the superb scenery than for the
                            notices  posted upon the bedroom doors at
                            Rigi Kulm: "Guests are forbidden to take the bed-clothes with them when
                            they go to see the sunrise."
                        So it was everywhere. There was no circumstance that did not furnish food
                            for her merry raillery. On one occasion when I reproved her because she
                            would take nothing seriously, she lifted from a shelf of the museum we
                            were visiting, a medieval bridle for a scold, and gravely handed it to
                            me, asking if it would not fit.
                    
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER VII
                        THE DAYS
                        DOROTHY DAY was the daughter of
                            wealthy parents, but they were parents who held their wealth as by no
                            means the greatest of their possessions. She had the advantage of being
                            the child in a household where the master and mistress were now
                            beginning to grow old together in the undiminished warmth of an early
                            attachment. Such households may be rare, but they exist, and happy is
                            the child who is reared under their influence.
                        The descendant of an old New York family, possessed of a liberal
                            education to which he had added considerable stores from travel, from
                            general reading and from a broad knowledge of the world, Mr. Day had the
                            tastes and instincts which come from cultured ancestry and surroundings.
                            His library was extensive and well chosen, and his collection of
                            pictures and works of art was one of the best to be found anywhere, for
                            it represented, not simply a vast outlay of money spent for the works of
                            popular masters, but the discriminating eye and clear judgment of its
                            owner. There had been much rummaging in obscure shops, and pieces of
                            unsuspected beauty had been brought forth from the lumber that
                            surrounded them. The collection was not 
                            so costly as many another, but it was representative of different
                            schools and periods. So, too, the furniture of the house expressed the
                            individuality of its occupants. Each piece had a history. There was the
                            glassware upon the table, which flickered with fitful suggestions of
                            that great scamp Cellini, who had designed the model; there was the rug
                            in front of the big fire place which recalled the shop at Damascus where
                            it was purchased; and another in the hall where the face of "Far Away
                            Moses" seemed to peer out through the intricate geometrical figures and
                            renew the Hebraic blandishments which had relaxed the purse-strings of
                            the American traveler; that Virgin in the corner with the soft bit of
                            color behind her, recalled the old junkshop where it had been stored
                            with worthless lumber, and also the joy which had attended the verdict
                            of the experts that it was the work of a historic school; those rubicund
                            carousers brought to remembrance the old castle in Savoy which had been
                            despoiled of its treasures by the extravagance of a profligate heir; and
                            the strange aggregation of prophets, apostles, monks, and crusaders from
                            many lands and ages, wdie apart, which were thrown together upon the
                            centerpiece of that old triptych, renewed the difficulties of
                            identifying the fifteenth century cavalier who was present when the
                            mantle of Elijah fell upon Elisha, as the older prophet mounted to
                            heaven upon his chariot of fire, while a fat little angel of the Lord
                                 whispered confidentially to Moses in
                            the corner. Ah! the catholic chronology of medieval art!
                        Mr. Day possessed that fortunate disposition which easily shakes off care
                            and never takes trouble upon interest, and he adopted in practical life
                            the classification we all believe but seldom follow, that there are only
                            two kinds of things which cause worry and distressthings you
                            can help and things you cannot, a classification which gives in either
                            case a better alternative than anxiety. He looked at life upon its
                            bright side, and from him undoubtedly came that sunny disposition which
                            was one of Dorothy's prominent characteristics.
                        His wife and daughters esteemed him naturally at his full value, indeed,
                            at a good deal more than his full value. For instance, when in early
                            childhood his little girls, Ethel and Dorothy, were talking of the story
                            of Jonah, and wondering how it could all be, Ethel suggested that the
                            fish were a great deal larger in those days and that the interior
                            arrangements were better adapted to human habitation, while Dorothy
                            interrupted the explanation with "Papa doesn't believe the story at all,
                            and he knows more than anybody in the world."
                        Although mamma would not have used quite that language, yet the oracular
                            power and infallibility with which papa's judgments were treated in the
                            home circle had much the same meaning.
                        Indeed, papa was greatly spoiled at his own fireside, and yet in that
                            household he was by no means  the most
                            important person. It was the mother toward whom all turned first for
                            counsel, assistance, inspiration, love. No woman was ever more
                            unconscious of herself. She had a quiet, mature dignity which she could
                            no more put on or take off at her own will than if it were part of her
                            own body. She was conscientious almost to a fault, a little aristocratic
                            in her natureno false vanity of rank or wealth, but a pride
                            which disdained all contact with what was unworthy. She was ambitious
                            for her husband and her children, and earnestly desired that they should
                            attain all good things, but only by such means as were pure and
                            honorable. As for herself, she would shrink from no sacrifice which
                            would promote their welfare. She was naturally quick of temper, but her
                            indignation passed in a moment like a puff of smoke, and her regret was
                            followed by added tenderness.
                        Her husband held the first place in her heart. It would be hard to say
                            which of her children was her favorite. She would not confess even to
                            herself that she had any preference. Her two daughters were as different
                            as possible from each other, not only in features, but in temperament.
                            In the years that have followed the acquaintance begun on the Urania, I have come to know from many family
                            conversations, the incidents connected with the childhood of these two
                            sistersso intimately, that it often seems to me that I have
                            been their companion from infancy.
                        
                        Ethel had been a dreamy child and her little world was peopled with
                            creatures of the imagination. Every grove had its dryads and every
                            stream its water nymphs, and every chamber in the big house, its own
                            peculiar household divinities. But these were not at all like the
                            figures of classic fable. The faces resembled those she knew and loved,
                            and she had names for all of them and considered them "her friends." For
                            a long time she told no one of this wonderful fairy world in which she
                            lived, for she felt that the fancy must be a very foolish one, and even
                            mamma would surely laugh at her if she knew it. But once, when her
                            mother was reading to her of the fancies of other children, she said
                            rather sheepishly: "Did you know, mamma, I had some friends, too?" And
                            strange to say, mamma did not laugh at all, but gravely answered: "Oh,
                            yes; I knew it." "Why, how did you know that?"
                        "Because when I was a little girl I had my friends."
                        "Did you, mamma? Then it isn't queer of me to have them?"
                        And after that her mother became her confidant and was introduced to this
                            new circle of acquaintances and learned how they looked, and what they
                            said and did. They were very reliable, these invisible friends, and when
                            Ethel was called away from home she always confided her dolls and
                            child's treasures to their keeping.
                        It always pained her to see any one in the chair  where her fancy had already placed an occupant, and once
                            she asked even mamma not to sit at the foot of the brass bedstead where
                            "the children" were lying. And later she took into her confidence a
                            friend who was visiting the house, and when the lady said: "I would like
                            to see them," she shyly opened the door to her little bedroom, pointed
                            to the empty chairs, and looked bashfully up, but said nothing.
                        So delicate were these confidences that a smile of incredulity would have
                            shattered them. Heaven was a real place to her as much as grandmamma's
                            or the old farm in the country at Aunt Mary's, and once when her mamma
                            was putting away her summer clothing, she asked that her best white
                            dress might be carefully ironed so it would be ready in case she should
                            be called to heaven "right away." She had big paper wings cut out ready
                            to be fitted at a moment's notice, and was quite as well prepared for
                            heaven as an Adventist with his resurrection robes; yes, better
                            prepared, I think, in many ways, for it ever there was a child who tried
                            to do her duty, it was she. And she wanted others to do their duty,
                            tootheir duty, be it said, as she understood
                            it, for that is the way with all good women, with little women as well
                            as big ones. And, therefore, at their summer home among the hills when
                            Bockerty, the rooster, would not lay eggs, but wandered away more than
                            he ought, she caught him and tied him to the big box with straw at the
                            bottom,  where the porcelain egg had long
                            ineffectually invited him to the performance of domestic duties.
                        In her studies, her dreamy imagination carried her along a line of
                            literature far beyond her years. She was fond of the lyrics of
                            Shakespeare, of Ariel's song and "Full fathom five thy father lies,"
                            songs that have indeed in them a melody of verse that appeals naturally
                            to a child.
                        There was about her an odd mixture of the child and the grown-up woman,
                            and a little later she would turn very naturally from reading "Comus" or
                            "Paradise Lost" to playing with paper dolls in company with other
                            children of her own age.
                        The children had many pets. For a short time they had a spotted coach-dog
                            they called Mustard, because he was so attractive and drew all things to
                            him like a mustard-plaster. Dorothy gave him the name, for she knew most
                            about the mustard, having ineffaceable recollections of it from the time
                            when the doctor put it on to cure a dreadful cough, after they had
                            stayed out in the wet and cold conducting the funeral services of a dead
                            blackbird.
                        Now Mustard was a stalwart, enthusiastic puppy. Ethel liked him all the
                            more "because he was young, and they could train him." But education is
                            often a harder task than we fancy, and after a month or two in which
                            Mustard had pulled their dresses from the clothesline, had torn
                            Dorothy's new pink sash, had chewed up the leg of Ethel's best doll, had
                            upset the glasses on the sideboard, and killed two  little chickens and a duck, Dorothy came one day with a
                            flushed face to her father, and asked: "Please, papa, can't we lose
                            Mustard?" So Mustard was appropriately lost, though Ethel some time
                            afterwards maintained there was a dog very much like him, only larger,
                            at Schneider's livery stable.
                        They had other pets left to console them. There was Thora, the Icelandic
                            pony, a wilful little beast, whose ancestors had so long eaten fish
                            during the winters, when other fodder was not obtainable, that she was
                            quite carnivorous. Once she ate a chicken that is, the chicken
                            disappeared and its feathers were seen about the pony's mouth and its
                            feet were left in the mangerevidence strong enough to send a
                            poor wretch to Tyburn.
                        Pony was a great favorite with the horses, who used to follow her
                            everywhere around the pasture nibbling at her neck and displaying every
                            sign of equine affection. Indeed, the only way to catch Matilda (who
                            could never be trapped by delusive oats or ears of corn) was to catch
                            the pony first and lead her back to the stable, when Matilda would
                            peacefully follow, which showed that she considered the claims of
                            friendship as stronger than she attractions of a dinner. The pony was a
                            great friend of the children, and was a very amiable little beast so
                            long as she was permitted to have her own way in everything. But when
                            Dorothy mounted her, sitting astride her fat little back, one could
                            never be quite sure in what direction Thora was going or at  what time she would return, and there was
                            a good chance (if she found a convenient spot to roll) that the child
                            would be dumped off till pony had taken her pleasure, when she would
                            again receive her burden and jog along in her own way as before. Pony
                            had a number of tricks. She could tell you by pawing the ground just how
                            old she was, but true to the instincts of her sex, there was a proper
                            limit of age which she declined to overpass and the children began to
                            doubt her veracity when they found that she remained constantly five
                            years old down to the day of her death.
                        When the governess began to teach the little girls the history of their
                            own country their busy minds were full of the great names that we all
                            revere. What then could be more appropriate than to name the numerous
                            cats upon the place after the fathers of the Republic?
                        The biggest one, of course, was George Washington, who walked in a very
                            stately manner, though he soon displayed qualities not at all consistent
                            with the honor and truthfulness of the great original. Benjamin Franklin
                            was very properly the most intelligent. His philosophic life was
                            prolonged to a good old age, while Thomas Jefferson, infected no doubt
                            with too much of the spirit of separatism and independence, suddenly
                            disappeared and was never heard of more.
                        Ethel made the acquaintance of a small mouse, who used to come out from
                            under the grate in the  nursery and listen
                            to her while her sang to her doll, and then ran back again when she
                            ceased. Indeed, all living things that came near her seemed to love her,
                            she was so gentle and quiet with them. But the sudden appearance of
                            Dorothy was sure to send them away.
                        When grandpa came to visit them, the children were quite sure of some
                            gift, a rocking-horse, perhaps, or a drum, a doll or bugle, for to
                            grandpa, his little granddaughters seemed to belong indifferently to
                            both sexes. And Dorothy was quite as fond of the little gun as of the
                            china tea set.
                        Ethel's dreamy imagination and quick conscience were always awake to
                            every call of sacrifice and duty, while Dorothy was looking out sharply
                            for her own comfort and had very practical and very material views of
                            life. Indeed, the little scamp slyly got credit for being better than
                            she was, for whenever there were apples or cakes or candy to be divided,
                            she always let Ethel make the division, knowing full well that from her
                            sister's goodness she would be sure to get the bigger half.
                        When she was very little she was in mischief most of the time. She made
                            strange figures with a black pencil on the white walls of the
                            dining-room and when mamma came suddenly upon her playing with her
                            sister and some other companions, and severely asked: "What is this?"
                            she spoke up at once and solemnly answered: "It is a duck," thereby
                            revealing the author of the transgression, as  indeed she always did when the fault lay at her door. For
                            though she sometimes fell into disgrace and was often chided for her
                            faults, yet there was one thing she would not do, she would not tell a
                            lie.
                        Perhaps the rogue found her interest even in this, for it was a rule of
                            her parents not to punish a child who had told the truth, no matter how
                            grave the offense, so as not to make her afraid to tell the truth
                            another time. No doubt Dorothy discovered this easy way getting off, for
                            she owned her little acts of transgression with engaging frankness.
                        Her theology was of a peculiar kind. Her God was a solid, anthropomorphic
                            god, and when the lightning flashed and revealed the outlines of the
                            black clouds through the inky darkness, as they sat together at the
                            window, she said: "Ethel, I know what makes the lightning. God is
                            standing just behind that cloud with a candle in his hand and he puts it
                            out and pulls it back again quickjust like that;" and she
                            suited that action to the word.
                        Once she had been put to bed and told to go to sleep, yet soon afterwards
                            her mother heard the patter of little feet over head, and on going up to
                            the room found the little scamp rummaging in the bureau drawers and
                            decorating herself with choice pieces of jewelry. She was again put into
                            her crib, with a sharp admonition, but pretty soon the patter was heard
                            once more and she was found sailing 
                            improvised paper boats in the wash basin. A spanking followed and a
                            promise of amendament, but the noise was heard again and the little
                            rogue was found on the floor playing with the kitten. Suddenly she
                            looked up and saw her mother's face right over her. Jumping to her feet,
                            she ran to the side of the bed, and with a look of consternation and
                            shame on her face, she fell upon her knees and said in great
                            earnestness: "Please, dear Lord, come and make Dorothy a good little
                            girl right away quick!" Many an older transgressor,
                            under like circumstances, desires the same sudden reformation.
                        But all her faults and shortcomings only set off the real charm of the
                            child, the dazzling happiness that surrounded her like an aureole, that
                            flashed from her mischievous eyes, and rang out in merry laughter from
                            her lips. It was instantly contagious. It filled the whole house with
                            joy. It made Dorothy's father call her his "Little Sunshine." And when
                            she had grown up it made a certain young man feel that there was light
                            enough in her presence to dissipate any gloom which might pervade all
                            other portions of the universe. And no moth ever flitted around a candle
                            with less regard to the singeing of his wings, than did I around the
                            flame of that bright creature's presence.
                    
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER VIII
                        ALBERT AND ETHEL
                        ALBERT had often said to me he would never marry. The
                            chains of matrimony were not for him. The liberty of a single life was
                            necessary for his roving and unstable nature, and he entirely denied the
                            possibility that there could be any one with sufficient attractions to
                            subdue him to domesticity. Yet, during the summer that he and I were
                            abroad it was plain enough that Ethel had stolen her way into his heart.
                            Her gentle manners never repelled him, never grated upon his
                            impulsiveness, and he became more and more devoted to her as the weeks
                            went by. As for her, it was easy to see that her affections were deeply
                            engaged. To me, indeed, such a result seemed inevitable. What girl could
                            be long in the companionship of such a man and resist his attractive
                            presence and brilliant conversation? Albert never spoke to me upon the
                            subject and when I tried to rally him, he retorted so vigorously
                            concerning myself and Dorothy that I thought it best to let him alone.
                            He was doubtless ashamed to admit that his claim of invulnerability had
                            been so quickly shattered. When we returned to New York, it seemed to
                            me, although no engagement was announced, that there was some  understanding between them. Finally I
                            asked him point blank if it were not so, and he told me about it.
                        One night on the voyage home they stood at the prow of the ship watching
                            the long pathway made by the moonlight upon the ocean. Albert was
                            talking of his plans for the future, of the political career he had
                            marked out when he should return to Louisiana, of his determination to
                            make for himself not only a fortune but a name. Dorothy would have
                            laughed me out of countenance if I had dared to make any such confession
                            to her, but Ethel was filled with sympathetic enthusiasm. She was sure
                            he would be more than all he hoped. She would follow his career at every
                            step, and how she would rejoice at his success!
                        A declaration of love came from his lips almost without his will. It was
                            not exactly the story of Othello and Desdemona, for his exploits were
                            not in the past but in the future. She loved him for the great plans he
                            had made and he loved her that she did smile on them.
                        Ethel's parents were unwilling that she should be married for some time
                            to come and insisted that she should have at least a year in society
                            before a definite betrothal.
                        The following winter was a brilliant one for her. At the balls, the
                            dinners, the theatre parties, she was greatly admired. Many were the
                            youths attracted by her gracious presence, and there was  more than one who sought her hand. She
                            had an invincible reluctance to inflict sorrow upon any one and when she
                            dismissed a suitor it was with such tenderness that it sometimes
                            encouraged him to continue his addresses. One of these incidents came to
                            Albert's knowledge, inspired him with the conviction that Ethel was a
                            coquette, and awakened in him all the resentment of his revengeful
                            nature. He acted in a manner quite in keeping with his character. He
                            uttered not one word of reproach, he continued assiduous in his
                            attentions, but he formed in his mind an atrocious resolution. He would
                            set about to win her affections more deeply than ever; they should
                            become engaged, and after the announcement was made he would forsake her
                            and let her feel the humiliation of desertion. This would be a fitting
                            punishment for her perfidy. And thus this gentle creature, utterly
                            faithful to the unworthy man to whom she had given her heart, was, each
                            week, each month, involved more and more securely in the toils. Her
                            parents, seeing that after her winter in society her affections were
                            unchanged, no longer interposed any objection to the engagement. Albert,
                            who was pursuing his studies at the law school, had, however, decided to
                            abandon the profession, having received a favorable business proposition
                            from some influential friends of his father's in New Orleans. So in June
                            the engagement was announced. Albert spent most of the summer at  the country home of the Days, and was
                            constantly with his affianced bride.
                        I went occasionally to visit Dorothy while he was there, and she played
                            her pranks upon me with greater freedom than she had ever done before. I
                            had once spoken to her with complacency of my exploits in horsemanship,
                            of leaping fences and of standing upon Roger's back. Dorothy was herself
                            accustomed to cross-country riding, though she never told me of this,
                            but devised a subtle plan for my discomfiture. One afternoon she
                            proposed that we should ride together across a tract of land that her
                            father was laying out as a park. We galloped merrily over the fields and
                            up and down the hills till we came to an old-fashioned stake-and-rider
                            fence, which had not yet been torn down. She whipped her horse and,
                            running ahead, cleared the fence at a bound and then turned around to
                            watch me. I followed as fast as I could, ran my heels into my horse's
                            sides and did everything which ought to be done to induce the brute to
                            go over, but he stopped short, with his head almost touching the fence,
                            while I writhed in many contortions trying to stay on his neck, upon
                            which I had been incontinently projected. I can see her now with her
                            fair hair streaming down her back and hear her ringing laughter at my
                            plight. Of course I had to try it again, and this time I was more
                            successful. I went over by breaking down the fence. Then we came to a
                            wide ditch and Dorothy's horse cleared it at  a bound, while mine first balked and then went splashing
                            through the mud at the bottom. Words cannot paint the tortures I
                            suffered at making the sorry spectacle I did in her presence. She had
                            given me a horse that could not leap, but she afterwards very demurely
                            expressed her surprise that I had found any difficulty at such an easy
                            thing. And when the fall months came and the Days went back to town,
                            Dorothy amused herself by teaching the Quaker boy to dance, and after I
                            had become proficient, as I thought, and had asked her to be my partner
                            in a German, I found that she had taught me something that nobody else
                            knew, and that except when I was dancing with her, I floundered
                            helplessly. She would banter me to do the most outrageous things, and
                            was indeed quite willing to make a little fool of herself if she could
                            see me performing a more important role of the same kind. Thus the
                            pranks I had been so fond of playing at college were visited upon my own
                            head with tenfold greater skill at the hands of the fair creature whose
                            eyes and laughter had such a charm for me that I could no more escape
                            than a fly from a spider's web.
                        She belonged to a small coterie of young women of her own age and
                            disposition, who organized a secret society in mocking imitation of
                            ours. The name of it was not Greek, however, but was declared to be
                            Choctaw. Into this a number of young men were initiated as associate
                            members and elected to offices which, when interpreted to us, we found
                            were  "Grand Ash Man," Sublime Rag
                            Picker," 'Majestic Chimney Sweep" and the like. We were once invited to
                            a dinner of the order, and when we walked into the brilliantly lighted
                            room, we found there were seats for the girls only, and aprons for us,
                            and that we were expected to wait upon them and take our own dinner
                            afterwards in the kitchen. But, however badly we might be used, none of
                            us could be driven away. There was nothing Dorothy ever asked of me that
                            I wouldn't do. If she had bid me put my head up the chimney, I would
                            have done it without questioning. Indeed, she did worse things than
                            that. She used to sit by me very demurely on the sofa and ask in an
                            interested way about my plans in life! Once she wanted to see a poem I
                            had composed, and finally beguiled me into reciting it for her! I creep
                            all over as I think of it! I had a very high opinion of that poem at the
                            time. I was under a sort of Tennysonian-Swinburnian spell and my
                            effusion glistened with Oriental imagery. It was called "Ayesha" and
                            began thus:
                        
                            "Evening. The crescent on Medina's mosque
                            Gleamed golden-glittering in the sunset sky
                            The palm trees climbed luxuriant up the hill
                            Whereon the prophet's holy city sat;
                            The trumpet-voiced Muezzin called to prayer,
                            And all Medina, falling, worshiped prone.
                            Sad, in the deep seclusion of her home,
                            Ayesha sat, Mohammed's blooming bride,
                            
                            Fair as the Houris in Al Arat's groves,
                            And streamlet-woven gardens, beauty-crowned,
                            Black-eyed and raven-haired, pale as the moon.
                        
                        The verses then went on to tell of a little domestic difference finally
                            healed by an appropriate revelation from Allah. I pronounced the lines
                            in a low key and with great solemnity. It seemed to me they were very
                            impressiveand Dorothy clapped her fair little hands at my
                            balderdash in great delight. Then she asked me for a copy, and a few
                            days afterwards she had a poem of her own, called "Cryesha," which she
                            recited for me in the presence of a few friends, in such droll
                            heart-rending tones, that it awakened universal merriment among the
                            others, who not knowing the source from which it was taken, could not
                            understand why I blushed and looked foolish and did not enjoy it.
                        Thus she made life a heavy burden to me. When we were alone she would
                            even upbraid me for my bashfulness, and then, when I offered her the
                            strongest tangible evidence that I was not bashful and tried to kiss
                            her, she would run like a deer and take shelter where I could not
                            follow.
                        Why is it that the boy will fall in love with the girl who torments him?
                            Her sparkling eyes haunted me by day and by night. Her face beamed out
                            of every page I read, and the song of every bird seemed to have in it
                            something of the echo of her laughter.
                        Meanwhile, Albert went to New Orleans to take  the place offered him in that city. I went down to the
                            steamer to see him sail. Ethel was there with her father, and the love
                            and utter devotion that spoke in her eyes and in every gesture and tone
                            of her voice would have been enough to have melted the heart even of one
                            who was bent upon revenge. I knew nothing of Albert's abominable
                            purpose, but I noticed even then that he seemed to treat her with a
                            certain coolness and reserve which I attributed to his consciousness of
                            the presence of others. I thought how differently I would act if it were
                            Dorothy, and I looked upon his better fortune with the elder sister, not
                            without a tinge of envy. Some two weeks afterwards I was at the Days'
                            and noticed that Ethel looked very pale and anxious. She asked me if I
                            had heard anything from Albert, said that she had not had a single word,
                            although she had written him every day, and he had promised to do the
                            same. She had also telegraphed and had received no answer, though her
                            father had learned at the office of the company that the steamer had
                            arrived. She was sure Albert must be very ill or that some accident had
                            befallen him. I had heard nothing, but that night I sent a telegram to a
                            friend of mine in New Orleans asking him to inquire, and next day I
                            received an answer that Albert had arrived safely and was quite well.
                            The thing was inexplicable, so I wrote him a full letter, telling him of
                            Ethel's anxieties and that I could not understand his conduct. An answer
                            came speaking of matters  concerning which
                            he said I could know nothing, containing vague hints of coquetry and
                            infidelities, with the remark that it was time that Ethel should herself
                            feel the bitterness of the sting which she had long since inflicted upon
                            him. I was filled with indignation and answered him that I did not
                            believe a word of his accusations, but that if he had had anything to
                            reproach her with, he should have spoken out like a man at the time, and
                            not continued his attentions afterwards, only to crush her now; that I
                            would have no such man among my friends, and that if he had nothing
                            better to say, all between us must be at an end. I received no answer; I
                            never heard from Albert again nor did I ever see him untilbut
                            that belongs to another part of this biography.
                        I called on Dorothy at once and I was glad that Ethel was not there, for
                            I would not have had the heart to break the news to her. Dorothy was
                            furious when I gave her Albert's letter. Her cheeks were flushed and her
                            eyes flashed fire. "And this comes," she exclaimed, "from giving her
                            heart to a man!" And she looked at me with such indignation that I felt
                            involved in the universal guilt of my sex, and could fancy that her
                            thought was, "How do I know that you would be any better?" But in a
                            moment her rage passed and the tears came (I had never seen her weep
                            before). "Poor Ethel, poor Ethel, how shall we ever tell her?" and
                            taking the letter and bidding me good-night, she hastily left the
                            room.
                        
                        It seems that Ethel, who had become distracted in her anxiety for
                            Albert's safety, had insisted upon going instantly to New Orleans
                            herself. Her mother had determined to accompany her and they had made
                            their preparations for leaving. Dorothy showed the letter to her mother,
                            who told Ethel that it would not be necessary to go, for they had just
                            learned from Mr. Dillingham that Albert was safe and well. Ethel's eyes
                            flashed with resentment. It was not true, it could not be true. Albert
                            could never have failed to write to her for so long a time. Mr.
                            Dillingham had been misinformed. But, said her mother, Albert had
                            himself written to Mr. Dillingham. And then Ethel did what every good,
                            true and devoted woman ought to do under the circumstancesshe
                            accused me of lying. And when her mother asked what motive I could have
                            for such a falsehood, she answered that she did not know or care;
                            perhaps I, who had been less happy in my attentions to Dorothy, was
                            envious at Albert's better fortunewho could say what the
                            motive was? Her mother tried to tell her as gently as possible the
                            contents of Albert's letter, softening the words as best she might to
                            take away the harshness of its meaning, but Ethel showed all the more
                            indignation against those who dared to fabricate such a story. And in
                            her desperation she was more than ever bent upon immediate departure.
                            Mrs. Day had not intended to show the letter to her daughter, but now no
                            other course was possible. Ethel read  it;
                            at first she was dazed, and then, uttering not one word against the man
                            who had so dreadfully wronged her, she began to reproach herself! She
                            must have given some apparent cause for the false report that had
                            poisoned him against her. She had seemingly been too kind to others,
                            though heaven knew that none but he had ever come within the shadow of
                            her heart! She sat up all night and wrote Albert a long letter,
                            passionate, tender, telling him in full all she had done in each and
                            every matter which it seemed to her might have given him the slightest
                            cause for his suspicions. She had not told him those things before,
                            because she had concluded that they were not her secret alone, and she
                            would not tell him now but for the dreadful misunderstanding they had
                            caused. She had always been what she still was, his and his only, and
                            whatever he might do, or however he might treat her, she would remain
                            his and his only until death. But Dorothy came into her room in the
                            early morning while she was still writing, and saw the letter. Such a
                            letter, she said, should never be sent. Her father was informed of it,
                            and in an earnest talk with Ethel he pointed out the shamefulness and
                            deceit of Albert's conduct and declared that no child of his should
                            ever, with his consent, become the wife of any man who was capable of
                            such duplicity. He asked her to consider what her future life would be
                            by the side of one who in the midst of smiles and caresses, was planning
                            his bitterest revenge. What confidence 
                            could she ever have in his word, what security that at any moment he
                            might not abandon or betray her? No happiness could ever be found in
                            such companionship. Mr. Day had always a very strong hold on Ethel's
                            confidence. In this case his reasons were unanswerable, and Ethel was
                            now obliged to face the dreadful truth that her love had been bestowed
                            upon one who was utterly unworthy of it. Her idol had been shattered and
                            within her heart there was nothing but emptiness and desolation.
                        She did not make any extravagant demonstrations of sorrow. She tried to
                            live in the old way, to go about her daily round of duties the same as
                            before, with a smile (what a sad smile it was!) for her sister and her
                            parents and her friends. But the shock was too heavy and it was not long
                            until her health began to give way. Morning after morning she appeared
                            with those heavy eyes that are the sure index of a sleepless night. She
                            said nothing more of her grief to any onenot to her sister,
                            not to her motherit was wholly stifled in her own breast, nor
                            did the others venture to speak to her of her sorrow, though her pale,
                            thin face was the constant reminder of it to all. As the weeks passed
                            on, her silent agony became more and more acute until at last it became
                            apparent that her mind was giving away. She imagined that Albert was at
                            her side; she began to talk to him, and sometimes Dorothy or her mother
                            would come upon her while she was calling him by the old endearing
                            names,  and planning with him for their
                            new house and the details of their future life. These agonizing scenes
                            became more frequent and cast a deep gloom upon the family. Dorothy even
                            ceased to torment me. I had told her what I had written to Albert, that
                            I had received no answer and never expected to hear from him again. And
                            although she said nothing, I saw an expression of gratitude in her eyes.
                            The family physician insisted upon a change of scene, so the Days
                            determined to spend the winter in Cuba. The surroundings would be new
                            and interesting and Havana was not so far away that Mr. Day could not be
                            called home again if any emergency should require it. The family left
                            about the first of December, and when the Christmas holidays came on, I,
                            too, determined to spend them in Havana! Dorothy was much surprised to
                            see me, but I think not altogether displeased. Her sister, although ill,
                            was no longer subject to hallucinations and had begun to take some
                            interest in the strange scenes around her, and the family were
                            encouraged. Dorothy had regained her spirits and now resumed her
                            occupation of amusing herself at the expense of the yoor youth who was
                            so deeply enamored by her dazzling presence that he had the power
                            neither to retaliate nor to escape. Again she made sport of everything,
                            but I could see from the way she watched Ethel that part of her
                            merriment was not quite spontaneous, but had also the purpose of calling
                            her sister away from her grief. The more Ethel seemed  shocked at her levity the greater
                            appeared to be Dorothy's delight. There was a little fat priest who came
                            each day to instruct the family in Spanish, who was a special object of
                            Dorothy's satire. He thought he understood the English language, and
                            indeed if English were spoken exactly as it is written, and if men
                            to-day actually talked the language of Addison and Sheridan, probably
                            the English of the good padre would have been comprehensible. He had
                            read much. He understood thoroughly the rules of etymology and syntax.
                            He had devoted more energy to the task than a Spaniard commonly devotes
                            to anythingbut he told us that he had learned the language
                            without a master. This we could have divined for as he talked away to us
                            in easy, pleasant, fluent fashion, it was often quite impossible to tell
                            what part of his conversation was in this alleged English and what was
                            in Spanish, the two languages sounded so much alike. Dorothy would
                            gravely talk to him in the same jargon which she imitated to perfection,
                            and he appeared to understand her more readily than the rest of us. Don
                            José was a timid creature, a very Don Abbondio for cowardice, and he
                            frankly gave us a comical description of losing his voice through terror
                            on the occasion of an earthquake while he was saying mass in a country
                            village, and of taking to his heels, followed by the entire populace.
                            Dorothy, who had some little talent in drawing, made a sketch of this
                            interesting scene which she gave to me with instructions  (similar to those on steamers in regard
                            to the use of life preservers), in case I should ever be caught in a
                            similar predicament.
                        My stay in Cuba was prolonged some time after the winter vacation was at
                            an end. The truth was I could not tear myself away from Dorothy, so I
                            came back with the Days in the latter part of January. I had a good deal
                            of extra work to make up on account of my absence, but this was no great
                            hardship, and now that I was nearing the end of my four years' course, I
                            found myself in the front rank of my class and this in spite of the fact
                            that I had entered college very young. My classmates, too, had conferred
                            a number of honors upon me; and when I returned from Cuba I found that
                            they had elected me class orator. I could not but look with some
                            satisfaction upon my academic career.

                        CHAPTER I
                        THE CALL TO ARMS
                        IT was amid such ocurrences as the foregoing, scenes
                            commonplace enough in the lives of the well-to-do, that there broke in
                            the discordant clash of arms. For this was the time of the beginning of
                            the greatest was in American history. There had long been mutterings of
                            the approaching storm. The political struggle which preceded the
                            outbreak of hostilities had been bitter and desperate. In this struggle
                            the great question to be decided was whether a vast region west of the
                            Mississippi, which was still unorganized, was to be devoted to negro
                            slavery. Douglas had thrown the apple of discord among the contending
                            factions when, in 1854, he secured the repeal of the "time honored"
                            Missouri Compromise, which had fixed the line between slavery and
                            freedom. After this repeal three great parties had struggled for
                            supremacythe South, with its claim that the constitution by
                            its inherent power carried slavery into all the territories, the
                            Northern Democracy insisting that these territories should regulate
                            their own "domestic institutions" in their own way, and the new
                            Republican party declaring that it was both the right and the duty of
                            Congress to prohibit slavery therein. In 1860 there  appeared, indeed, a fourth party which pretended to ignore
                            these burning issues, but like all negative forces, it counted for
                            little in the contest. It was the division among their adversaries that
                            gave the victory to the Republicans and elected Abraham Lincoln,
                            whereupon the South, considering the choice an attack upon its most
                            cherished institution, determined to break up the Union. State after
                            State seceded, the Confederacy was organized, and with the fall of
                            Sumter began the stern reality of Civil War.
                        It is hard to-day to realize the intolerance of the fury which swept over
                            the country at this dreadful time. The man who in the South gave
                            utterance to "incendiary doctrines" concerning the abolition of slavery
                            was not permitted to live, while in the North those who opposed the
                            general wave of patriotism which swept over the country after the fall
                            of Sumter were often compelled to seek safety either in silence or in
                            flight. The President called for seventy-five thousand volunteers, a
                            number pitiful enough by the side of the enormous armaments afterward
                            required by the exigencies of the war; but then it seemed very large.
                            The quotas were quickly filled. But soon new levies were needed. new
                            requisitions were made, and it was not long until it seemed clear, at
                            least to me, that the government ought to have the services of every
                            young man in the North who loved his country and who was able to go the
                            field.
                        
                        In the matter of my Quakerism, although I had strayed far enough from the
                            fold, and had become to all outward appearances one of the world's
                            people, yet there were certain things absorbed in early life that were
                            still clinging to me closer than I knew, forming part of my essential
                            nature, and although lying dormant upon ordinary occasions under conduct
                            that was often frivolous and foolish, yet coming forth unexpectedly at
                            critical moments, and controlling my actions, almost against my will.
                            Among these things was the habit, acquired in childhood, of following
                            implicitly every strong and clear conviction of duty. I might argue as
                            much as I liked that there was no illumination of the spirit, no
                            certainty that "the voice within" was telling me the truth, yet the
                            habit of obedience was there, and in really important matters if I once
                            definitely saw a thing was right, that was the end of the matter, I had
                            to do it, and I must consider blessed every man of clear intelligence in
                            whom that habit has been implanted in early life.
                        There were points of Quaker doctrine, however, that took no deep root in
                            me, such for instance as the peace principles of the
                            societyfor they seemed to me not workable. I felt that all
                            government was and must be founded upon force, that if there were a few
                            bad men in the world determined to use their power, they could prevail
                            against a whole universe of non-resistants. So I was a poor Quaker as
                            far as fighting was concerned. Yet there was another  "testimony" borne by the Society that
                            affected me profoundly. It was the protest which was very early uttered
                            by Quakerism against all forms of bondage and oppression, both that
                            spiritual oppression in matters of conscience and belief from which
                            Friends had so greatly suffered in the times of the persecutions, and
                            also a protest against all forms of traffic in human beings. For the
                            Quakers were perhaps the pioneers in the agitation that culminated in
                            the overthrow of African slavery. The Quaker, Benjamin Lundy, was the
                            first of the Abolitionists, the predecessor of William Lloyd Garrison;
                            nearly all the members of the Society took an interest in anti-slavery
                            movements, and some, like Lucretia Mott, Isaac T. Hopper and Levi
                            Coffin, were very prominent therein. Among the "queries" respecting the
                            state of the society to be answered at the periodical "meetings of
                            business" was one inquiring whether Friends were "clear" of
                            participating in any form in the traffic in human flesh. Even in the
                            South members of the Society generally refrained from owning slaves,
                            while in the North they were most active in aiding fugitives to escape
                            across the Canadian border.
                        The family in which I had been born and bred had its full share of work
                            in the anti-slavery agitation. My dear little auntie always insisted
                            that everything which came into the house should be the product of free
                            labor. No cotton, rice, hemp, coffee or anything else would she use
                            unless she was satisfied  that no slave
                            had had a hand in its production. She would not touch a plate of
                            ice-cream or preserves at a friend's house until she knew that the sugar
                            had not been defiled by the traffic in human flesh. She regarded the
                            products of slave labor as stolen goods. The slave had been robbed of
                            his wages for producing them, and to her they were unclean. She used to
                            attend the meetings of the Anti-slavery Society, which was sometimes
                            rather a dangerous thing to do, since rioting and bloodshed occasionally
                            occurred in the efforts to break up these assemblies.
                        All our family were Abolitionists and our house had been a station on the
                            Underground Railroad to Canada. Grandmother especially had been very
                            active in her efforts to succor the refugees, and I often heard mother
                            tell of "Darg," a negro who had been concealed for months in our house
                            while his pursuers were searching for him elsewhere, as well as of the
                            lawsuit that followed, of mother's own appearance on the witness stand
                            where she baffled the lawyers of the slaveholder, and although keeping
                            strictly to the truth, told nothing of what they wanted to know. For
                            when the trial came on and the rest of the family went off to some
                            unknown place in New Jersey, she was left alone in New York for the very
                            reason that she was the only one who knew nothing about the negro,
                            having been absent while he was secreted in the house. Therefore her
                            examination came to an untimely end, for 
                            she did not even know where the rest of the family had gone, they having
                            expressly left no word. So in the summing up all that could be said was
                            that "Mrs. Thrivewell and her family had been spirited away; nobody knew
                            how and nobody knew where." It was with great unction that mother used
                            to relate this circumstance and tell of the quiet return of the family
                            after the skies had cleared again.
                        I had indeed personal knowledge of some of these interesting scenes. One
                            morning when we were at breakfast there was driven up to the door, by an
                            ill-looking driver, a large family of negroes crowded into a hack. There
                            was the old grandmother, the man and his wife and the little children,
                            one of them a baby. They had been sent on to us by some Friend further
                            south, had traveled all night, had crossed the ferry in the early
                            morning, and were consigned to us for further expedition. I remember the
                            terror-stricken faces of the negroes, the obvious curiosity of the
                            driver, and our fears when we dismissed him that he would inform the
                            authorities. We gave the fugitives a hasty breakfast, provided them with
                            funds and conducted them to another Friend's house in town until they
                            could be sent on with greater safety at night.
                        No one whose recollection begins after slavery was abolished can quite
                            realize the deep fervor of the Abolitionists. They were willing to
                            undergo any kind of martyrdom in the blessed work of setting free the
                            captive, while the sympathizers with slavery  regarded them a Pariahs, thieves, and even traitors, for
                            had they not declared that the matchless constitution of our fathers was
                            itself a covenant with death? Our family did not hold these extreme
                            views of the Garrisonians, but for all that we came in for our share of
                            the opprobrium.
                        It was amid such influences that I had spent my early years. I had read
                            with breathless eagerness the accounts in the "Anti-Slavery Almanac" of
                            the separation of families, the flogging, the branding; sometimes,
                            indeed, the burning at the stake of helpless negroes, and my heart had
                            been stirred by outrages which were the natural fruit of the deplorable
                            institution of slavery. I recall among other memories of early boyhood,
                            a small paper-covered book entitled "The Narrative of James
                            WilliamsA Slave," giving a detailed account of the tortures
                            inflicted by one "Huckstep," an overseer, a man who was generally
                            intoxicated with peach brandy, and flogged women to death and swore
                            dreadfully! I was especially interested in the "Life of Peter Still,"
                            for I knew Peter; he came often to our house while he was preparing his
                            book for publication, in order to raise the money to liberate Vina his
                            wife. Some one else wrote it for him, for he was not able even to read.
                            Peter had been kidnaped and taken South when he was a boy, and had
                            suffered much, but at last he fell into the hands of a good master, a
                            Jew, who allowed him to work at night for others and save money with
                            which he bought his freedom, and I 
                            remember the comments we made, how splendid it was that a Jew would act
                            so honorably when by law he might have kept both the money and the
                            man.
                        I read the life of Fred Douglas and the biography of Linda, a slave woman
                            who sometimes used to work for us, who had been kept concealed for years
                            in the low attic of a house near her master's plantation (a room where
                            she could not stand upright) before she finally made her escape. I read
                            the accounts of the fugitives who were guided for weeks and months by
                            the North Star on their way to liberty. I read "Helpers' Impending
                            Crisis," that "incendiary" book, the mere possession of which sometimes
                            gave short shrift to the luckless wight upon whose person it was found.
                            "Uncle Tom's Cabin," however, I had not read, because "Uncle Tom's
                            Cabin" was a novel, and at that early period of my life all novels were
                            forbidden.
                        Thus from my childhood there was begotten in my heart an intense hatred
                            of that baleful system which afterwards wrought such havoc in our
                            country and which, though long extinct, has left deep scars that
                            sometimes bleed afresh even to-day.
                        I well remember the day when the news came of the invasion of Harper's
                            Ferry by John Brown. I had risen very early that morning and had come
                            down to the dining-room while the lights were still burning. Uncle
                            Ephraim held the newspaper in his thin hands, which were trembling. A
                            strange light glittered in his eye; his words were incoherent  as he handed me the paper. How solemn and
                            silent was the breakfast! No one spoke in approval of the act, for how
                            could we as consistent Friends, approve of a lawless deed of violence
                            and blood? But what burning sympathy there was in the flushed
                            facesand how earnestly the boy of the household hoped that the
                            oppressed negroes would win the liberty which was their right! I can see
                            now the madness of it all, the crime, indeed, of thus attempting to let
                            loose upon the people of the South the passions of an enslaved race.
                            Then I could see only the auction block, the lash and the wrongs that
                            had been heaped upon the slaves, and this great wickedness done by the
                            freest and foremost people in all Christendom! How I prayed that God
                            might set free the slave and bring to naught the pride of his
                            oppressors! And when the attempt failed, as was inevitable, how bitter
                            the disappointment! How we watched every step in the trial which
                            followed! How we hung breathless over the words that described the
                            heroic constancy of the wounded man in his bed in the court-room; how
                            our hearts were torn with anguish in the fatal hour when we knew that
                            his life was to be offered as a sacrifice upon the gallows to the race
                            that he would have delivered from bondage! How eagerly we bought the
                            "Life of John Brown," which appeared soon afterward, written by Redpath,
                            his associate in Kansas! All these things can be understood only by the
                            few survivors of the thousands who felt as we did and whose hopes  and prayers and sufferings were the
                            inspiration of that great song whose notes still awaken a thrill as keen
                            and deep as any of our national melodies.
                        And now the war had come, the war for freedom, the war for the
                            preservation of the Union. Another call had been made by the President
                            for troops and I felt as if it had been addressed to me personally. It
                            was high time to make up my mind whether I would go or stay. All night I
                            lay awake thinking it over. Poor mother! It would nearly break her
                            heart! I certainly did not desire to go. I was just completing my
                            college course. I had been chosen class orator and expected soon to
                            graduate with honors. But then came the argument: "Upon whom had our
                            country the right to call if not upon such as I?" There never was a
                            better cause, the preservation of the world's great Republic, the
                            transmission intact to future times of that precious heritage which had
                            come from our revolutionary fathers. Nay, more; it was to be a better,
                            purer and greater republic than it had ever beenfor my
                            instinct told me that slavery could not long survive the overthrow of
                            the Confederacy. And then the President who had culled us, Lincoln, the
                            great-hearted, honest, gentle, magnanimous! How tender were the words of
                            his first inaugural where he besought the wanderers to return!
                        He had been our choice for the great office he was filling. But of what
                            value the support of his partisans, if at the trying moment they would
                            not  come forth at his call to sustain him
                            in performing the heavy duties they had cast upon his shoulders? And the
                            poor slaves! We had worked these many years, here a little and there a
                            little, to right their terrible wrongs; we had helped to rescue a few
                            families from bondage, but now when the supreme moment had come, which
                            would decide whether slavery should live or die, a decision involving
                            the destiny of millions, should I shrink from devoting my
                            servicesperhaps my lifeto the great cause? The slave
                            power had lifted its mailed hand against the best government on earth,
                            and woe to the country, and to the world if the children of the great
                            republic held back when they were called to defend her! It was curious,
                            too, how visions of Dorothy mingled with these thoughts. I had little
                            reason to think that she had any great care whether I went or stayed,
                            and yet the thought came again and again, "I shall be worthy of her only
                            if I do my duty." When the morning light streamed through the curtains
                            of my little room, my mind was made up. I would tell my father first.
                            How would he take it? He was a minister of the Society of Friends, and
                            that society had always "disowned" any of its members who took up arms
                            and engaged in carnal warfare. I cared very little about the "disowning"
                            on my own account, but such a thing would be a humiliation to him, and
                            he had always loved me so tenderly that the thought gave me much
                            uneasiness. Still there was nothing else to be done. I could not be  coward enough to run away, so after
                            breakfast I told him all. He was deeply moved, but there was no
                            resistance on his part to my purpose. He looked at me for a few moments
                            with tears in his eyes and then said: "Well, my boy, if thy conscience
                            tells thee that this thing is right, it is not for me to judge thee." I
                            knew from this how deeply he sympathized with me. Indeed what can the
                            Quaker say when he is told "I believe this to be my duty." To him the
                            "inner light" is the supreme law and each must judge for himself whither
                            it leads. The principle may be disorganizing, but it leads at least to
                            tolerance and charity. Well, I was not disowned. Indeed, there were so
                            many young Quakers at that time in the same boat that to disown us all
                            would have greatly thinned the ranks of the Society, and so just was the
                            cause and so strong our reasons for going, that although the act was a
                            dreadful breach of the "Discipline," I fear it met with a certain
                            sympathy and even tacit approval on the part of those in authority. The
                            meeting was much infected with the war spirit.
                        Mother, as I had feared, was nearly heartbroken when she heard of my
                            determination, and moved about the house pale and silent under the
                            weight of a great sorrow. I felt a keen remorse at her suffering. She
                            uttered not a word of reproach, but I could see it all in her eyes,
                            which seemed to say to me: "My one child! the single joy and comfort of
                            my life, and he forsakes me, all for an idea! What  to us are the wrongs of othersnay, what is even
                            our country that it should outweigh a mother's love!" But there was
                            nothing now that could shake my purpose.
                        Then came again the thought of Dorothy. What would she think? I called
                            upon her the second night after my resolution was taken. She was alone.
                            We talked for some time about other things and then I spoke of the
                            matter rather casually, as something in which perhaps she would not be
                            greatly interested. But she became instantly very serious. "Do you mean
                            it?" she asked, and when I assured her that I did, "When do you go?" I
                            told her in a very few days, that the company in which I had determined
                            to enlist would leave for the front within a week. "Why have you done
                            this?" she asked, and I explained to her fully why I believed it was my
                            duty. She was silent for a few moments, and then looking at me with as
                            bright a smile as ever I saw upon her face, she said: "You have done
                            right; you have done right! Oh how I wish I were a man!" Her warm
                            sympathy (almost the first I had ever had from her) was very grateful to
                            me, but in it there was not the least sign of regret at parting with me,
                            and I thought as I walked homeward, "Well, she has never loved me, why
                            should she care?" I little dreamed what happened after the door had
                            closed on me and she had locked herself up in her own room. I did not
                            hear until long afterwards.
                    
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER II
                        ARMY LIFE
                        TO a young man in the vigor of health the first
                            impressions of army life are far from disagreeable. At this time the hot
                            days had not yet come, everything was green with the freshness of early
                            summer, the constant out-of-door existence had its stimulating effect
                            upon my spirits, and I felt in a way as if I were beginning the world
                            over again. Our camp near Washington was situated in a broad meadow by a
                            woodland. The men in my company were for the most part energetic,
                            intelligent fellows, and although their interests in life had been quite
                            different from my own, and some of them seemed quite ignorant of the
                            studies which had formed the bulk of my education, I found their company
                            far from disagreeable.
                        It was still a considerable time before we were actively engaged. To our
                            great disappointment our regiment was detained for the defense of
                            Washington, and during the first few months there was little to vary the
                            monotony of camp life. We were drilled a great deal, but it appeared to
                            me that much energy was wasted upon the mere ornamental parts of the
                            manualour wheeling and facing this way and that and holding
                            our arms in all sorts of positions as if 
                            we were to go on parade or review rather than to actual battle, and I
                            felt sure that we had far too little target practice and no means
                            whatever of correctly estimating distances when we should afterwards be
                            placed upon the firing line.
                        There are a good many things quite apart from mere military evolutions
                            that the young recruit is sure to learn in camp. He finds, for example,
                            that military service, at least among volunteer soldiers, is in many
                            ways a great leveler of class distinctions. Where all alike have to
                            perform menial dutiescooking, digging trenches, cleaning the
                            camp, etc.social rank counts for nothing and mere book
                            knowledge stands for very little except so far as it is the index of
                            general intelligence. The college man has scarcely any advantage over
                            the artisan or the farmer's boy and I soon came to respect very highly
                            men whom I would hardly have noticed in civil life. At first it struck
                            me as remarkable that it was often an uneducated man, one who could not
                            even talk good English, who was the quickest to learn the manual and the
                            most handy in performing the unexpected duties which the sudden
                            exigencies of army life required. Captain Jessup commanded our company.
                            He had received his commission on account of his father's political
                            influence with the governor and at first he was neither liked nor
                            respected. He was not merely an ignorant man, but seemed to be one of
                            less than ordinary capacity. He would give his orders to us from the
                            manual and it  was often plain that he did
                            not understand the text. Once, seeing in the book the direction "Right
                            or left oblique (as the case may be)," he repeated it literally, and
                            roared out to us in stentorian tones the command "Right or left oblique,
                            as the case may be! March!" It is not easy to imagine the confusion
                            resulting from such leadership. We had very little respect for Jessup
                            until after the first battle, when his enthusiasm and his superb
                            personal courage made us forget all that had gone before. He seemed to
                            become another man under fire, and he led a charge upon a small battery
                            with such cheers and oaths and wild gesticulations that no man who was
                            half a man could have lagged behind.
                        But I am anticipating. When the order came for us to go to the front, we
                            were filled with delight, and cheer after cheer went up from the
                            regiment when it was announced. It was a glorious summer morning, clear
                            and cool, when we broke up our camp. The dew had gathered heavily upon
                            the grass during the night so that the drops glittered when lit by the
                            early sunbeans, like innumerable jewels; and still brighter did the sun
                            flash from our sword-bayonets and the polished barrels of our rifles.
                            Before us the woodland on our left cast a long inviting shadow across
                            the road we were to take. Other regiments near us were breaking camp at
                            the same time, and one by one they fell into line on the broad plain at
                            our right. Martial music resounded through the air at intervals, and
                            then the stirring  rattle of the drum made
                            our hearts beat fast and high with exciting anticipations. The colors of
                            the regiment, still bright and virgin, untouched by bloody contact with
                            the foe, fluttered tremulously in the light wind, and the steeds of the
                            officers pranced and caracoled before us as their riders shouted their
                            commands. We started on our way with cheers and songs, but when noon
                            came we began to realize the meaning of a long march under the fierce
                            glare of the Southern sun. Our heavy knapsacks became too great a burden
                            and we began to throw away the treasures we had stored in them, the
                            extra shoes and blankets, the books, everything indeed except articles
                            of the uttermost necessity. Occasionally a man would drop by the way,
                            overcome with heat and weariness, but would afterwards struggle on again
                            and join us when we halted for a meal or for the night. There were very
                            few wilful stragglers among the early volunteers. On the second morning
                            we started again full of enthusiasm and it was not long till we began to
                            hear shots in front of us, at first mere desultory firing, then a more
                            continuous and regular rattle of musketry and the occasional booming of
                            cannon. Evidently we were going into action. We were still too green in
                            the service to know just what that meant and the firing was too distant
                            to give us any great uneasiness, yet we became more thoughtful, we sang
                            our songs as on the previous day, but not with the same careless joy.
                            Soon we passed a field hospital erected in a small ravine where  the banks might afford some protection
                            from the enemy's fireand as we advanced we began to meet the
                            wounded straggling to the rear. Some had their hands on their blouses at
                            the place where the ball had struck, some had gashes on the head or
                            across the face, one was clutching his abdomena bad case, with
                            small hope of recovery.
                        We asked of those who were able to speak with us how the fight was going
                            and they answered that we were beaten and that the slaughter was awful.
                            This filled our spirits with apprehension, for we had not yet learned
                            how prone are the wounded to regard the battle as lost. Behind these men
                            came others, bearing upon stretchers those who were too badly wounded to
                            walk. These were covered with blankets, occasionally even the head was
                            concealed. We would inquire of the bearers, "Where is he wounded?"
                            putting our question in a low voice, with that involuntary awe which the
                            presence of great suffering inspires. Generally they answered us "In the
                            knee," "In the foot," "In the shoulder"; sometimes they said nothing,
                            but gloomily shook their heads. And in such cases we knew that the wound
                            was fatal. Most of the men they carried were groaning. One of them
                            screamed outright. The cries of agony from a strong man are pitiful and
                            unnerving, and soon the drums began to beat loudly and we could hear
                            nothing else. That is their sad office! But their beating could not
                            stifle the look of anguish, the open, panting mouths, the deathly  pallor of the face, the writhing and the
                            dripping of the blood under the stretcher.
                        After the wounded men had passed, our songs began again, for we needed
                            them to keep up our spirits. A little further on, sentinels were posted
                            with instructions to stop every man going to the rear who could not show
                            blood, and the few stragglers who attempted to pass and avoid battle
                            were driven back again. We asked these sentinels how the fight was
                            going. They answered that the enemy had made an attack and had been
                            temporarily repulsed, but it was believed he was receiving
                            reinforcements and would soon renew it. We had come they said, just in
                            time to fill up a dangerous gap in the line. We now saw a regiment
                            emerging from a large woodland in front of us and taking position in a
                            wheat field on the right, and still other bodies of troops, we could not
                            tell how many, all making a flank movement in the same direction. Then
                            the order came that we were to occupy and hold the woodland they had
                            left. As we were moving forward to take this position, a distressing
                            sight confronted us. On each side of the road was a stakeand-rider fence
                            and at the angles lay the wounded who had fallen in the immediate
                            neighborhood who could not yet be taken to the hospital. Blankets had
                            been put across those angles at the top to shelter them from the fierce
                            sun. Some of them were calling for water and we gave it to them from our
                            canteens. A few of these men were in gray. They  were Confederates who had been left behind when their
                            comrades had been forced to retreat. One of them had his leg torn away
                            and pointed to another who was still more horribly mutilated. He grinned
                            at us as we passed and cried: "That's what you're coming to. You'll
                            catch it in the woods." Another man who was dying cursed us as we went
                            by; another maliciously uncovered for us the face of a corpse that was
                            lying at his side and showed us the bettles that were beginning to
                            gather upon it. Other dead men were scattered along the road and in the
                            fields that bordered it. We were beginning to find out now what war
                            meant. There was no more singing.
                        We entered the woods and deployed to the left, moving cautiously, with
                            pickets thrown out some distance in advance. No enemy was there. But
                            there were many reminders of the recent struggle. The dead were lying
                            around us, not in any great numbers, but distributed irregularly through
                            the forest. A few of the wounded who had been overlooked were still
                            there groaning. We sent for stretchers and had them taken away. The
                            pickets reported that there was a stubblefield beyond the woods rising
                            gradually to a low ridge, with a stone fence at the top, and a negro
                            told us that there were cannon just beyond. Except a few pickets, no
                            enemy was visible. We imagined the Confederates were forming behind the
                            ridge, and our supposition proved to be correct. Our orders were "Hold
                            the  woods," so we could advance no
                            further but were compelled to await their approach.
                        There was now a delay of two hours. It seemed like days to us. There is
                            nothing more trying to raw troops than this expectancy. We filled our
                            canteens at a small brook that ran through the forest, and ate our
                            hard-tack, though with slender appetites, as we awaited the
                            inevitable.
                        A cannon shot in front of us announced the beginning of the attack. Other
                            shots followed and in a moment more a shell exploded at the foot of a
                            tree. The tree came crashing down in the midst of the company, but no
                            one was hurt. So these shells were really not so dangerous as they
                            seemed! But soon another dropped in our midst. The man next to me on the
                            line was lifting the canteen to his lips; he fell forward with a groan
                            and never spoke again. Death was now coming pretty close. That man had
                            shared my tent and been an intimate companion in the camp. I seemed to
                            hear a voice cry "Next!" but I stifled my agitation. I would have given
                            all I possessed if I could have hid myself in the earthall but
                            my self-respect. I couldn't quite give up that, so I had to stand and
                            take my chances. There was no enemy in sight, no one to shoot, no glory,
                            no honorwe must simply stay there and await our destiny. The
                            order came: "Lie down!" "Lie close!" No second instruction was needed.
                            We lay there half an hour, the shells crashing through the trees not far
                            away. Not many of us  were injured. The
                            shells were badly aimed and most of them fell short. Once I heard a
                            horrible scream. I knew the voiceit was Downing, of Company A,
                            the merriest comrade in the regiment. His arm had been torn off. I had
                            ceased to care for the shells, but the shriek unnerved me. It is a bad
                            thing to hear a scream like that! At last the sounds of cannonading died
                            and we began to hope the enemy had given up his purpose. But the pickets
                            came running in and cried: "They are charging the wood, a whole brigade
                            is coming!" Still we could see nobody.
                        It seemed to me then that a mistake had been made in thus posting us in
                            the middle of the forest. If we had been at the edge of the wood we
                            could have seen the approaching forces as they crossed the field and
                            could have decimated their ranks from our concealment while they were in
                            the open, but among the trees we could only fight them on equal terms
                            from such shelter as each man could make for himself. As I think of it
                            now, however, our colonel had done better than we knew, for the enemy
                            had supposed we were close to the open field when he shattered the edge
                            of the woods with his artillery and left us almost unharmed beyond. We
                            could now hear what seemed an innumerable multitude yelling like wild
                            beasts as they burst into the forest. This was the trying moment for us.
                            Would we stand or flee? No man quite knows beforehand what he will do.
                            Was it courage that kept us in  our
                            places, or was it the greater fear of disgrace? We heard the voice of
                            our colonel as if he were managing an unruly horse: "Steady! boys,
                            steady!" and no one broke the ranks. We had stood the first great test.
                            Each man, however, sought the protection of some tree or boulder or
                            fallen log and held his gun in readiness, awaiting the approach of the
                            foe. The underbrush was thick and the enemy could no longer advance with
                            speed. Now for the first time we began to see the gray-coats. We took
                            aim with care, and though our marksmanship was none of the best, a good
                            many of them dropped before our fire. Then they stopped and sought
                            shelter as we had done, and each man for himself did what mischief he
                            could to his antagonist. The aim on both sides was too high, and we
                            could see the twigs and leaves and small branches dropping everywhere as
                            if shaken by an autumn wind. Soon the smoke became dense and it was only
                            for an instant when it would drift away that we could fire with any
                            effect, but that moment was the time of greatest danger to ourselves. We
                            could still hear occasionally the cries of a wounded man, but we paid
                            less attention to this than at first; we were too busy with our own work
                            of destruction. I even thought, "This is by no means as bad as I have
                            pictured it," and it occurred to me that the great battle paintings I
                            had seen were much exaggerated. The time came, however, when no picture
                            nor description nor dream could outstrip the reality. But that was
                            afterwards.
                        
                        The firing in the woods lasted perhaps half an hour. In the meanwhile we
                            could hear a sharp engagement going on in the wheat field at our right
                            and the sound of cheering which appeared to advance. I could begin to
                            tell the difference between the short, sharp rebel yell and the
                            prolonged cheer of our own men. Evidently our troops there were driving
                            back the Confederates, and this continued until the line in front of us,
                            being outflanked, and the position no longer tenable, our assailants
                            began to withdraw. We pressed on after them, firing as rapidly as we
                            could, and I noticed that more of their number were killed in the
                            retreat than while they were facing us. So it was really more dangerous
                            to withdraw than to advance! It is a good thing for a soldier to learn
                            that lesson early.
                        At the edge of the wood we halted, and looking up to the stone wall on
                            the crest of the ridge in front of us over which the gray-coats were now
                            passing, we realized that behind it must be the battery which had opened
                            the engagement. We rushed forward at once to charge it. And here it was
                            that Captain Jessup's wild fury communicated its contagion to us, and
                            redeemed him in our eyes. We captured only one gun, which could not be
                            limbered in time to escape us. We saw the rest going off at a gallop as
                            we crossed the wall. We had no orders to advance further, so we remained
                            where we were. And now the wind rose suddenly, we heard behind us a
                            warning sound of dreadful portent, and looking back  saw that the woods were on fire and that a terrible
                            calamity must await the men who had fallen in the timber. The shells
                            which had exploded at the beginning of the engagement had ignited the
                            underbrush in several places. Those fire were small, and nobody notice
                            them amid the smoke and excitement of the fight and it was some time
                            before they spread. At last when the wind rose, the fire caught the
                            large trees and the edge of the forest became a sheet of flame. Wounded
                            men who could not extricate themselves were lying just beyond. They
                            shrieked in terror and agony as the flames swept towards them, but we
                            could not reach them and they were stifled with smoke and burned to a
                            cinder before our eyes. Most of them were Confederates, but a few were
                            our own comrades. As soon as we could enter the woods we sought the
                            charred remains and gave them burial.
                        We bivouacked on the stubblefield that night. Our enthusiasm was gone,
                            but a more determined feeling, perhaps quite as valuable in a soldier's
                            makeup had taken its place. We had behaved with credit in our first
                            fight. The action had been one of no great importance and would hardly
                            be recalled now among the battles of the war, but we had been successful
                            and had acquired some of that confidence that comes with success.
                            Afterwards we were not always so fortunate. For a long time we were more
                            often on the retreat than on the advance. And the repeated defeats on
                            the Peninsula, at Manassas, 
                            Fredericksburg, and Chancellorsville, scarcely redeemed by the
                            indecisive victories of South Mountain and Antietam, tried our souls
                            greatly, before the tide began to turn in our favor.
                    
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER III
                        SOLDIERLY CHARACTERISTICS
                        I SHALL not relate in detail the history of all our
                            campaigns but merely refer to the few incidents that mark the changes in
                            character that come with a soldier's experience. Naturally the value of
                            human life, so great in times of peace, was little regarded. Death was
                            so common among us that we thought lightly of it. There was of course a
                            pang when one comrade after another was missing at the campfire or
                            failed to report at roll-call, but we had too much on hand to allow us
                            to spend our time in grieving, and we might ourselves "turn up our toes"
                            before another sundown. What difference who went first or who went last?
                            Yet our duty no less than our safety required of us that we should not
                            expose ourselves rashly and we became more and more careful as our
                            experience in the service advanced, to take no unnecessary risk but to
                            protect ourselves in whatever way we could from hostile fire. Indeed
                            this caution was often mistaken by some of the new recruits for timidity
                            and we would sometimes see a contemptuous smile on their faces while
                            they were exposing themselves out of mere bravado to needless dangers.
                            Many was the sharp reproof we gave them for their temerity and those  who survived grew to be careful like
                            ourselves as time went by.
                        Doubtless there were occasions when our patriotism flagged, when we would
                            have been glad to have been away from the terrible scenes we were forced
                            each day to witness, but this was rather a fleeting impulse than a deep
                            conviction, and there were very few moments when, if the matter were
                            calmly considered we would not have enlisted again, with the full
                            knowledge of all that was before us. War is a dreadful thing, but there
                            is no better touchstone for ascertaining how great is a man's love for
                            his country.
                        If life became of little importance in our eyes, naturally the
                            subordinate right of property was often wholly disregarded. Fences,
                            barns, dwellings, crops; all were destroyed with impunity when they
                            interfered with military operations or when they might be used to
                            shelter or maintain the enemy. At first this seemed hard upon the
                            suffering population of the country, but soon we thought no more of it.
                            First of all came our own natural right as it appeared to us, to such
                            food as we needed. We were generally hungry, and if our haversacks were
                            empty, the bacon and corn and chickens that we found had to supply our
                            needs. We paid for them when we couldif not, they were not
                            paid for. I remember my horror when I first saw the bodies of the dead
                            rifled upon the field. Yet it was not long until I was filling my
                            cartridge box and haversack with ammunition  and rations in the same ghoulish fashion, or exchanging my shoes or
                            my blanket for something better that the owner would no longer need. Why
                            not? The service gained rather than lost by such appropriation.
                        But if our moral sense concerning rights of property was somewhat
                            blunted, there was one virtue that we held in far greater esteem than
                            civilians. The good soldier must be a man who has no fear. This quality
                            of courage we respected as much in an enemy as in a friend. Once when we
                            had charged a battery, the driver of one of the gun carriages had been
                            unable to bring off his piece before we came up. He was just starting
                            with it as we arrived. We pointed our muskets at his head not two yards
                            away and ordered him to surrender. He paid not the slightest attention,
                            but whipped his horses and started. His courage was so superb in the
                            face of inevitable death that we could not fire and actually allowed him
                            to drive his gun away. Bad soldiery this, no doubt, but our admiration
                            stifled every other feeling and we cheered him as he escaped us.
                        In other cases we were more cruel than the laws of war allowed. A
                            sharpshooter had been firing at our men from the crotch of a tree where
                            he had been hidden and protected by the trunk. He had killed one of our
                            lieutenants whom we greatly loved and had wounded two other men. When we
                            came close to him he dropped his rifle, threw up his arms and cried: "I
                            surrender." Doubtless our duty was  to let
                            him come down and make him our prisoner. But we were too furious for
                            this. Half a dozen balls went crashing through his skull and he dropped
                            heavily on the ground at our feet.
                        We could not but admire the bitter disdain with which the high-bred
                            Southern women met us at the doorways of their plantation homes when we
                            sought water at the well or provisions from the garden or the farm-yard,
                            and the scorn with which the girls watched us pass through the streets
                            of their villages and towns on our errand of destruction. Though we
                            would gladly have had a smile or a friendly greeting, I am not sure but
                            we thought the more of them for hating the enemies of their friends and
                            kindred and for looking through us and over us without a word or sign of
                            recognition.
                        The gray-coats themselves bore us no such personal animosity. When they
                            lay wounded side by side with our men there was little difference
                            between the help they would extend to an enemy or a comrade in reaching
                            some protecting tree or log, or in sharing their tobacco, or the
                            contents of their canteens and haversacks. Beneath the contemptuous
                            epithets of "Yank" and "Reb" there lurked a silent comradeship borne of
                            mutual respect, of common dangers, and of common sufferings. Except when
                            our passions were aroused by some immediate outrage, our feeling for the
                            men in the enemy's ranks was not personally hostile, and the desire at
                            one  moment to kill, and the next to
                            succor, seemed as natural as the change from cloud to sunshine.
                        The negroes that we saw on the plantations did not appear half as eager
                            for their freedom as I had imagined. They did not rush to us and ask
                            protection or seek to escape under the shelter of our presence, but
                            commonly kept on at their work as if no war existed and no emancipation
                            was in sight. True, they were always friendly, they would give us what
                            they could of their little stores, sometimes going hungry themselves
                            that we might have a hoe-cake, and supplying us with correct information
                            as to the position and doings of the enemy and other
                            thingsexcept one. We found that no negro would betray his
                            master or his master's family. Was this affection, was it fear, or the
                            mere habit of servitude? No doubt there were varied ingredients in this
                            fidelity. But faithful he was and kind, and now after the lapse of forty
                            years I am reluctant to believe the stories of the wild passions of a
                            savage race that threaten the homes of the South and require the halter,
                            the torch and the mad fury of a lawless mob for the protection of the
                            women and children.
                        Heaven knows it was no love of glory, no mere ambition that had drawn me
                            to the war. I had enlisted as a private soldier, though I might well
                            have had a lieutenant's commission if I had sought the necessary
                            "influence" to procure it. Yet once in the field I had a strong desire
                            to distinguish myself  and win promotion
                            and fame, not so much for my personal satisfaction as on account of
                            Dorothy, whose image followed me everywhere, in the camp, on the march,
                            in the fight, and amid the sickening scenes of the field hospital, and
                            stimulated me to the performance of my duty.
                        Our last interview, when she had spoken with such approval of my going to
                            the war, had filled me with the most intense determination to act with
                            credit. After our first battle I received by mail a copy of the New York
                                Tribune in which the conduct of our regiment was
                            highly praised. It seemed to me that the address had been written by
                            her, though the characters were different from those of her ordinary
                            handwriting and looked as though they had been made by an unsteady hand.
                            There was no explanation nor did I hear from her in any other way. My
                            mother wrote me that the Days had closed their house in the city but she
                            did not know where they had gone. I was sure that however little
                            affection Dorothy might have for me, she would certainly have a friendly
                            sympathy and pride in my achievements, and that she would be
                            disappointed and humiliated if I failed. So I wanted an opportunity to
                            win what laurels I could. On the death of Coporal Fletcher, at the
                            battle of Seven Pines, I was promoted to his place. At South Mountain I
                            became sergeant, and after Chancellorsville (where we had rendered
                            important service at the time when Stonewall Jackson was killed), I
                            received  a lieutenant's commission. I was
                            tempted to write to Dorothy and tell her of my good fortune, but I
                            refrained. Experience had made me very shy of saying anything to her in
                            praise of my own achievements.
                        But there was one drawback to the inspiration of Dorothy's image in my
                            thoughts. It added tenfold to my fear of mutilation. How could I face
                            her, a cripple, mangled, torn, like the hundreds I had seen after every
                            battle, with God's image all but obliterated? It is said that very few
                            soldiers go into an engagement without a presentiment that this time
                            they are to fall. The presentiment of death I did not have, because I
                            cared little for it, but the presentiment of some dreadful wound
                            constantly beset me. Where would the ball strike? Would it be here in my
                            hand, or on the leg, or on the face; and as I wondered, the frightful
                            image rose before me of a man borne by on a stretcher with grinning
                            teeth gaping from a cheek that had been torn away! It was the spectre of
                            that face, side by side with Dorothy's that haunted me as I slept in our
                            bivouack before the battle, and stood by me while we awaited the enemy's
                            attack, until my breath was stifled and the sweat came dripping from
                            every pore. Yet through it all I trained myself not to flinch and never
                            to dodge the balls that whistled by, which is, indeed, an unnecessary
                            precaution after the danger is over, but still one as natural and almost
                            as hard to avoid as not to close your eyelids when an insect flies  against your eye. No one ever imagined
                            the torments I suffered from the fear of bringing my mutilated body into
                            the presence of the woman I loved. If such a fate should befall me I
                            thought often of suicide. I could not quite make up my mind to that, but
                            of one thing at least I grew determined. In such an event Dorothy should
                            never see me again. I would flee to the ends of the earth before I would
                            permit her to gaze upon such a presence.
                    
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER IV
                        THE INVASION OF PENNSYLVANIA
                        THOSE who belong to a later generation and merely know
                            of the Civil War from the record of it as embodied in history, will find
                            it hard to realize the fatuous disbelief that prevailed throughout the
                            North in the seriousness of the struggle in which we were engaged. This
                            incredulity continued from the time of the political campaign that ended
                            in the election of Lincoln down to the very midst of the great war. The
                            threats of secession were regarded as idle vaporings. Why should the
                            Union be dissolved because an unacceptable candidate had been lawfully
                            elected? When South Carolina called her convention we felt sure that
                            after it met, wiser counsels would prevail. When the ordinance was
                            adopted there was little fear that other States would be fanatical
                            enough to follow her example. Even after the Confederate Government was
                            organized at Montgomery, we felt that surely they would not be so mad as
                            to fire upon the flag! When Sumter fell and the horrible reality dawned
                            upon us that war, the impossible, had come, still we were consoled by
                            the belief that it would be quickly over. What was the power of the Gulf
                            States and the Carolinas by the side of the inexhaustible resources of
                            the North?  Virginia would reject the
                            ordinance of secession and remain faithful to the Union. When Virginia
                            joined her sisters of the South and the capital of Virginia became the
                            capital of the Confederacy, then it seemed to us that it would be all
                            the easier to crush a rebellion whose vital point was thus thrust
                            forward within such ready reach of our advancing hosts. "On to
                            Richmond!" was the chorus of the Northern press, and no one doubted that
                            in a few weeks the head of the Confederacy would fall.
                        A rude awakening came with the defeat at Bull Run and the mad panic that
                            ensued. "The Capture of Washington" was cried through the streets of the
                            metropolis day after day by boys who sold to excited crowds extra
                            editions of the evening papers. But the panic passed and the confidence
                            which followed was scarcely less serene and certain than at first. All
                            that was needed was that the North should be aroused and the army
                            organized, so McClellan, the great "organizer," began his task. The work
                            went on much slower than seemed necessary, but at last all was ready and
                            the Peninsular campaign began. Victories were announced at York-town, at
                            Williamsburg, at Seven Pines. Nothing more natural, nothing more
                            inevitable than this. The army was already close to Richmond, a day or
                            two more and all would be ended and the flag float again over a united
                            nation. Then came the report of the final seven days' struggle and the
                            retreat to the James River. Still even this was at first merely  a "change of base," and it was a hard
                            task to convince the people of the North that the campaign was a failure
                            and that the work had to be begun again. Indeed they refused to believe
                            that the defeat was serious. It was merely McClellan who would not
                            fight. Give them a new man and all would be well. So Pope was brought
                            from the West and put in command. His first orders showed the stuff he
                            was made of! There was to be no more talk of lines of retreat and bases
                            of supply. From that time it was to be a forward march! But the second
                            defeat of Manassas was as bad as the first, so McClellan was again put
                            in command, and while the invasion of the enemy into Maryland was
                            checked at Antietam, all aggressive movements were futile and McClellan
                            was again relieved. Burnside's repulse at Fredericksburg and Hooker's
                            defeat at Chancellorsville showed the superiority of Lee's generalship,
                            if not the superiority of the Confederate soldier. We who were at the
                            front realized far sooner than those at home the terrible nature of the
                            conflict in which we were involved; but very few, either at home or at
                            the front, anticipated the formidable invasion of the free States and
                            the campaign which reached its climax in the terrible struggle at
                            Gettysburg.
                        There were several reasons which determined the Confederate authorities
                            to this daring step. Their resources were limited and were becoming
                            exhausted; they could not suffer the war to drag on  indefinitely. Grant was closing slowly around Vicksburg,
                            and it was necessary, by a brilliant victory in the East, to force the
                            recall of his army, or at least to offset the impending disaster on the
                            Mississippi. On the other hand, great disaffection existed in the North;
                            there was a strong party opposed to the war; the terms of enlistment of
                            a large number of troops was about to expire; volunteering had ceased in
                            consequence of repeated disasters and a conscription might provoke armed
                            resistance. Moreover the Army of the Potomac was still under the command
                            of a general who with an overwhelming force had failed miserably. Now,
                            therefore, was the time for the Confederacy to strike. But how? The army
                            under Hooker lay between Lee and the city of Washington in a strong
                            position. It must be drawn out of its intrenchments and encountered in
                            the open field. What better means of accomplishing this purpose than an
                            invasion of the North? This would relieve Virginia from a hostile army.
                            As the rations of the Confederate troops were running short, Lee could
                            replenish them in the fertile regions of Pennsylvania, or by the
                            occupation of some of the wealthy cities of the North. A victory there
                            might cause even the evacuation of the Federal capital. Moreover our
                            relations with foreign powers were critical; if Lee could establish
                            himself on Northern soil, England might recognize the Confederacy, ample
                            loans could be obtained and perhaps a foreign alliance formed and a
                            fleet sent  to open the ports of the
                            South. If the Army of the Potomac could be destroyed Southern
                            independence would be achieved.
                        There was, indeed, one drawback; the long line of communications between
                            Richmond and the Confederate army would be imperiled. Lee might procure
                            forage even if this line were severed but the constant supplies of
                            necessary ammunition could not be obtained on Northern soil. This was
                            the vital danger.
                        But it was resolved to take the risk. Lee left his position at
                            Fredericksburg and moved with his army up the Shenandoah Valley. The
                            Blue Ridge on the east protected him from attack and observation, for
                            the gaps in the mountains were easy to hold and fortify. General Milroy
                            was at Winchester in this valley with a garrison of Union soldiers, but
                            owing to a series of blunders he was quickly defeated and the pathway to
                            the North was cleared.
                        In the latter part of June, Lee crossed the Potomac, passed rapidly
                            through Maryland, and keeping to the west of the South Mountain range,
                            which formed the continuation of the Blue Ridge, he invaded the Keystone
                            State. His army consisted of three corps commanded by Ewell, Hill and
                            Long-street, respectively. On the 27th, Ewell reached Carlisle, while
                            Early, commanding one of his divisions, had seized York. On the same day
                            the corps of Longstreet and Hill reached Chambersburg and its vicinity,
                            under the immediate command of Lee 
                            himself. Nowhere was there any serious opposition.
                        There was, of course, great excitement in the North, levies of troops
                            were made everywhere and many regiments of militia were hurried forward.
                            But what could these do against the Army of Northern Virginia?
                        Hooker had received early information that Lee was disappearing from his
                            front and was marching down the Shenandoah, so he determined to follow,
                            keeping east of the Blue Ridge and South Mountain, and thus holding the
                            inside lines between Lee and the city of Washington. He crossed the
                            Potomac a few days after Lee, and made his headquarters at the city of
                            Frederick in Maryland.
                        In consequence of his inexcusable failure at Chancellorsville, the
                            confidence of the administration in his generalship was greatly
                            impaired. He was, moreover, on bad terms with Halleck, the general in
                            chief of all the armies. He now asked Halleck to let him take the
                            garrison at Harper's Ferry to reinforce his troops. But Halleck
                            objected, where-upon Hooker at once offered his resignation. In spite of
                            the president's aphorism, "It is a bad thing to swap horses while
                            crossing a stream," it was determined to make the change at once, even
                            in the immediate prospect of an impending battle. George G. Meade, the
                            commander of the Fifth Corps, was selected as Hooker's successor, and
                            ordered to assume the command. He earnestly protested, but no discretion
                            was given him and he obeyed.
                        
                        Meade's position was indeed one of extraordinary difficulty. He had no
                            time to make the acquaintance of the troops he was to command nor even
                            to learn the details of their organization. He first proposed to to
                            review and concentrate them at Frederick, but it was shown to him that
                            the delay would give Lee time to cross the Susquehanna and capture
                            Harrisburg, so he was forced to act immediately even though he had to
                            act in the dark; and Hooker's plans were, with some modifications,
                            adopted. It was determined to interpose the Army of the Potomac between
                            the enemy and Philadelphia if Lee went north, or between him and
                            Baltimore and Washington, in case he turned southward.
                        The two armies were now on the eve of the decisive battle of the war, and
                            it will be interesting to consider and to contrast for a moment the
                            commanding generals, their immediate subordinates and the number,
                            organization and character of the troops.
                        The Confederate army was commanded by Robert E. Lee, the most skilful
                            general of the Civil War. He was at this time fifty-seven years of age,
                            tall, dignified, serene, aristocratic, tactful, brave, chivalric,
                            God-fearing, conscientious to a fault, and generally sound in judgment.
                            He was deeply beloved by all who knew him and he was the idol of the
                            army he commanded. When they discussed around their campfires "the
                            origin of the species," it was said, "the rest of us may come from
                            monkeys,  but it needed a God to make
                            Marse Robert." Even before the Civil War his career had been brilliant.
                            He was a distinguished officer in the Mexican war, repeatedly brevetted
                            for skill and gallantry. He had filled the office of Superintendent of
                            the Military Academy at West Point with ability. He was at first opposed
                            to secession, but after Virginia severed her connection with the Union,
                            although Lincoln offered him the supreme command of the army, he cast
                            his lot with his native State and resigned from the Federal service. In
                            the early campaigns in West Virginia he was not successful; but he
                            afterwards became the military adviser of President Davis, and when
                            General Jos. E. Johnston was wounded at Seven Pines, Lee was given the
                            command of the Army of Northern Virginia. Calling to his aid the
                            redoubtable Stonewall Jackson, he defeated the Federal troops in several
                            great battles in his native State. His prestige was unbounded. He had,
                            however, as a military man, two faultshis modesty was such
                            that he lacked self-assertion, that despotic quality which compels
                            obedience and fear and exacts the utmost from subordinates; he left too
                            much to the discretion of his corps commanders. He had another defect:
                            "a subdued excitement occasionally took possession of him when the hunt
                            was up, which threatened his superb equipoise," and which, in the
                            presence of the enemy in an aggressive campaign, sometimes led him to
                            headlong combativeness in the field. When he invaded Pennsylvania he was
                                 overconfident even to rashness of the
                            invincible power of his own troops. Little wonder indeed when he had
                            seen them at Manassas, at Fredericksburg, at Chancellorsville,
                            triumphant against such overwhelming odds.
                        On the Union side the commander-in-chief was a man of no such splendid
                            presence nor brilliant history. George G. Meade was of a stooping
                            figure, tall, spectacled, short-sighted, resembling a scholar rather
                            than a soldier. His training, like that of Lee, had been mainly as an
                            engineer. He had served in the Seminole war and then in Mexico though in
                            an humbler station than his great adversary. He took a subordinate part
                            in the campaign in the Peninsula. At Manassas he commanded a brigade; at
                            Fredericksburg he led a division; at Chancellorsville he commanded the
                            Fifth Corps. He was a man just, reasonable and brave, but he was
                            excessively modest and over-cautious in directing his troops. He took
                            command under enormous disadvantages and the result of the campaign
                            showed that, on the whole, he commanded well.
                        It was quite fitting that the defense of Pennsylvania should have been
                            confided so largely to the soldiers of that commonwealth, led by the
                            most distinguished of her generals, for besides Meade, both Reynolds and
                            Hancock were from the Keystone State. With such men and with Slocum,
                            Sedgwick and Doubleday in command of corps, with Pleasanton and Buford
                            in the cavalry, and Hunt in control  of
                            the artillery, the efforts of the commander-in-chief were in the main
                            ably seconded.
                        When "Stonewall" Jackson was killed at Chancellorsville, the right arm of
                            the Confederacy was broken. In Longstreet, Ewell and Hill, the
                            commanders of the three corps of three divisions each into which his
                            army was now divided (in place of the two which had been led by
                            Longstreet and Jackson), Lee had, indeed, men of experience and ability,
                            but Ewell and Hill could ill take the place of the great Jackson.
                            Longstreet, whom Lee effectionately called his "old war horse," was a
                            tenacious and excellent fighter, but slow in movement and he lacked the
                            sure instinct of Jackson in seizing at once the decisive opportunity of
                            the battle.
                        The size of the two armies at Gettysburg will never be exactly known. The
                            best estimates give Meade a little over 90,000 men with 300 guns, and
                            Lee a little over 70,000 men with 190 guns. These figures, however, do
                            not at all represent the fighting power of the two armies; in
                            organization, discipline, physical condition and morale, the
                            Confederates were greatly superior. Their regiments, brigades and
                            divisions were well filled; the soldiers were nearly all veterans, whose
                            terms of service lasted for the war. They were enured to every kind of
                            hardship; they could live upon little and march untiringly day and
                            night; they had been seasoned by every kind of experience, had stood the
                            brunt of battle many times and had been so uniformly successful that
                            they  now believed they were invincible.
                            Their discipline for practical purposes was as nearly perfect as a hard
                            struggle like the Civil War could make it; their confidence in their
                            leader was unbounded, and they felt that they were about to crown a
                            series of victories by a triumphant and crushing blow delivered in the
                            enemy's country. As they entered Pennsylvania the belief was universal
                            that "Marse Robert will get the Yankees this trip, suah." "Except in
                            equipment, a better army, better nerved up to its work, never marched
                            upon a battlefield." But its equipment was defective, some of the
                            infantry had nothing but smoth-bore muskets, and the ammunition for the
                            artillery was poor. The men were badly clothed, some of them were
                            barefoot; some covered their heads with nothing but a plait of straw;
                            most of them were ragged, and they were all as begrimed and dusty as the
                            roads on which they marched. When they entered Gettysburg it was said:
                            "One cannot tell them from the street," and sometimes (this is no
                            disadvantage in war) they were not seen or noticed because they looked
                            so much like the mother earth on which they stood. It was only their
                            rifle barrels, their bayonets and their colors that shone in the
                            sunlight.
                        A bitter outcry has been made against the ravages they committed, the
                            property they confiscated, the contributions they levied, the live stock
                            they drove away. But this was war. They took what they
                            neededclothes, carts, horses, cattle, provisions  they sent supplies back to Virginia, and
                            for all these things they paid in Confederate currency, which proved
                            worthless, indeed, but it was all they had, and it was what they used
                            themselves at home. They did not wantonly destroy property nor commit
                            unnecessary cruelties. Lee had forbidden this before they had passed
                            into northern territory. It was greatly to the credit of the "ragged
                            rebels" whose homes had suffered from the ravages of war, and who had
                            heard innumerable tales of outrages upon their people, that they were so
                            generally free from the spirit of revenge. There were indeed complaints
                            of their manners. "They were a rude and filthy set," declared the tidy
                            Germans of Gettysburg. Their manner of eating was shocking; they threw
                            apple-butter in all directions while spreading their bread, but they
                            harmed no women, children or non-combatants; nay, more, a Confederate
                            soldier would even go out into the street amid a shower of bullets to
                            get a bucket of water for a mother and her little ones. In the flush of
                            anticipated victory they were true to the best traditions of their
                            race.
                        In organization, physical training and morale, the Army of the Potomac
                            was at a disadvantage. It was composed of no less than seven corps. It
                            was too greatly divided for proper union of effort. There were too many
                            commanders and too many staffs.
                        The divisions and brigades were much smaller than in the Confederate
                            army; the proportion of  veterans was much
                            less; many of the regiments were not well filled; there were new
                            organizations of recruits not easily assimilated, and which weakened the
                            power of the army to endure long marches and extreme exertion; the
                            number of stragglers was very large; many of the officers were
                            distrusted, and there were bickering and jealousy among those high in
                            authority. Lee's army, on the oother hand, was a unit in its excellence,
                            and in spite of its discrepancy in numbers and equipment, was, under its
                            great chief, more than a match for the often defeated Army of the
                            Potomac under its untried commander.
                        But at the outset Lee made a serious mistake. While he was marching up
                            the Shenandoah, he gave Stuart, who commanded his cavalry, the
                            discretionary right to separate from the main body of the troops and
                            pass, with three out of his five divisions, to the east of Hooker.
                        Stuart led a bold but useless raid around the Federal army; passed close
                            to Washington and Baltimore, advanced into Pennsylvania, and after two
                            ineffectual efforts to join, first Early at York and then Ewell at
                            Carlisle, he arrived on the field of Gettysburg, worn and exhausted by
                            forced marches, on the evening of July 2d, barely in time to take part
                            in the cavalry engagement of the final day of the battle.
                        Two divisions of Stuart's command, indeed, had been left behind to guard
                            the gaps of the Blue  Ridge and then
                            follow Lee across the Potomac, but they did not reach Gettysburg until
                            the third day.
                        The cavalry is "the eyes of the army" to watch the enemy's movements. Lee
                            was invading for the first time a hostile country where he could obtain
                            no information from other sources, and until the 28th of June he was
                            wholly in the dark as to the movements of his adversary.
                        On that day a man named Harrison, a spy and scout of Longstreet's, who
                            had followed the Federal army to Frederick and there found three corps,
                            one of which was about to move westward and threaten Lee's
                            communications, now made his way to the Confederate army and reported
                            what he had found. Lee, startled to find that Meade was close upon his
                            heels, immediately changed his plan. He called Ewell back from a
                            projected attack upon Harrisburg and directed the whole army to
                            concentrate at Cashtown, a small place eight miles northwest of
                            Gettysburg, so as to threaten Baltimore and thus compel the Union forces
                            to turn eastward and abandon any attempt upon his rear. Two divisions of
                            Hill's corps which had reached Cashtown now advanced still further to
                            the southwest toward Gettysburg looking for the enemy. Thus it was that
                            that town became the scene of the great conflict.
                        Gettysburg lay east of the South Mountain range. There were ten roads
                            that here came together like the spokes of a wheel, by which Lee could
                            move upon Harrisburg, Philadelphia, Baltimore or  Washington or could retreat, either east or west
                                o- the mountains, back to Virginia. It was,
                            therefore, a most important point to hold. Each of the two commanders,
                            Lee and Meade, had resolved to fight a defensive battle; each had
                            counted upon time for preparation, and neither had fixed upon Gettysburg
                            as the place of the encounter. The different corps of Meade's army were
                            spread out over a considerable territory. They were to advance and feel
                            for the enemy, and when he was found, they were to retire, drawing him
                            on as far as Pipe Creek where the line of battle was to be formed, and
                            his further progress definitely resisted. This plan was not easy of
                            execution. A retreat in the presence of an active and confident enemy
                            may become a rout before the stand is made, or if Meade carried out his
                            maneuver, Lee might still have declined to attack him in his chosen
                            position and might have passed around it and thus have compelled the
                            selection of another place for the decisive encounter.
                        Moreover, when an army full of spirit has been advancing against an enemy
                            it is often as difficult to effect a retrograde movement with the
                            immediate prospect of a battle, as it is to rally troops that are
                            defeated. Neither officers nor men will retire when they have come to
                            fight, and when they see before them the opportunity to win a victory.
                            This is exactly what happened at Gettysburg. The officers in command
                            would not dishearten their men by withdrawing them from a good position
                            which they could hold if reinforced in time.
                    
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER V
                        THE FIRST DAY'S BATTLE OF GETTYSBURG
                        BUFORD, who commanded a division of the Federal
                            cavalry, had been directed to advance to Gettysburg, and on the evening
                            of June 30th he arrived in that town. Reynolds was a few miles behind
                            him with the First Corps; Howard, with the Eleventh, was a little
                            further to the southwest; Meade, with the Second and Third Corps, was at
                            Taneytown, fifteen miles south, while the three remaining corps were
                            stretched out as far as West-minster, more than thirty miles distant.
                            The army was too widely scattered.
                        Buford knew that a portion of the Confederate forces would soon be upon
                            him, and he determined to interpose between the enemy and the town.
                        West of Gettysburg several parallel ridges rose one after another, the
                            last and highest of which, a number of miles away, formed the South
                            Mountain range. The ridge nearest to Gettysburg, about a half a mile
                            west from the town and running nearly north and south, was crowned by
                            the Lutheran Seminary, and was called Seminary Ridge. It was covered by
                            an open wood from which the ground sloped westward and then rose again,
                            forming the second, or McPherson's Ridge, 
                            
                             which was broader and lower than the
                            first one. Both terminated together at Oak Hill, a point which thus
                            commanded their slopes and the low land between them as well as a level
                            plain north of Gettysburg.
                        West of McPherson's Ridge, Willoughby's Run flowed southward, and on this
                            ridge, directly west of the Seminary, a wood filled the slope down to
                            the run. There were three roads from Gettysburg that crossed these
                            ridges; one going southwest to Hagerstown by way of Fairfield, another
                            going northwest to Chambersburg by way of Cashtown, and a third still
                            further to the north. The Seminary was in the fork formed by the
                            Hagerstown and Chambersburg roads. It was upon these ridges that Buford
                            determined to interpose his resistance.
                        The Confederate corps under Hill was approaching along the Chambersburg
                            road. Before nine o'clock the battle of Gettysburg began. Buford's
                            skirmishers gave way slowly, contesting every step. After an hours'
                            fighting Reynolds arrived, soon followed by the troops of the First
                            Corps who took the place of the slender lines of Buford's dismounted
                            cavalry.
                        An important position was the piece of woods between the Chambersburg and
                            Hagerstown roads, extending from McPherson's Ridge down to Willoughby's
                            Run. The Iron Brigade entered these woods from the east just as the
                            Confederate brigade of Archer was crossing the run to enter upon the  other side. General Reynolds, at the
                            eastern edge of the wood, turning to see whether the remaining troops of
                            his corps were approaching, was shot by a sharpshooter and instantly
                            killed. The Iron Brigade swooped around the right flank of Archer's
                            troops and captured them. But a Federal brigade under Cutler, north of
                            the Chambersburg road, had retreated in confusion to the suburbs of
                            Gettysburg, although it afterwards returned to the front. Other
                            Confederate brigades and divisions were steadily advancing.
                        General Howard had come upon the field just at the moment when Cutler's
                            brigade had been driven in, and he sent a message to Meade at Taneytown
                            that the First Corps had fled, thus magnifying this retreat to the
                            flight of an entire corps.
                        The Eleventh Corps reached Gettysburg about one o'clock. Two divisions
                            were directed by Howard to go north of the town, to prolong the line of
                            the First Corps to the right. The remaining division with the reserve
                            artillery was directed to occupy Cemetery Hill just south of Gettysburg.
                            This was the first definite step taken in the selection of that
                            admirable defensive position.
                        The two divisions north of the town were compelled to form their line of
                            battle on low, open ground. They did not connect with the First Corps on
                            their left, and their right flank was also exposed.
                        Early's division of Ewell's corps, coming from York, attacked the slender
                            line. Soon both divisions  fled and were
                            driven back in confusion into Gettysburg. The streets were blocked with
                            guns and wagons, and the Confederates, screaming, shooting, stabbing,
                            pursued the retreating troops through the town and made prisoners of
                            thousands.
                        The First Corps, deprived of its support, was now in desperate straits.
                            Two divisions had lost half their men, and Doubleday who had succeeded
                            Reynolds in command withdrew the remnants and finally joined Howard on
                            Cemetery Hill. It was about this time that Lee arrived upon the scene
                            and witnessed the retreat of the Federal troops.
                        This was the vital moment when the defeat of the Union army might have
                            been turned into an overwhelming disaster. A mob of fugitives was
                            pressing up the slopes of Cemetery Hill. All that was needed was a final
                            blow, and the last rallying point of the Federal army would have been
                            carried by the victorious Confederates. It is said, indeed, that Lee
                            sent Ewell a direction to "press those people and secure the hill, if
                            possible, but not to bring on a general engagement." With his customary
                            reliance upon his corps commanders, Lee had not made the order absolute.
                            And now there occurred one of those trifling events which sometimes
                            change the fate of the world. It was the shower in the night before
                            Waterloo which delayed the attack of Napoleon and prevented the early
                            overthrow of Wellington. It was a false report that some Union troops
                            were advancing on the extreme  left of his
                            corps, which induced Ewell to send two brigades in that direction. The
                            absence of these brigades now caused him to hesitate; he had another
                            division under Johnson which would soon be coming up and he determined
                            to await its arrival. It did not reach the field until sundown. The
                            supreme moment was lost, for the Federal troops were then reorganized
                            and reinforced.
                        The regiment in which I served was attached to the Second Corps,
                            commanded by General Hancock. When the battle began we were at Taneytown
                            with the commander-in-chief, fifteen miles away. It was after one
                            o'clock when the message came from General Howard that the First Corps
                            had fled. Meade at once sent Hancock forward to the field of battle to
                            take command of the Union forces, to rally the troops, and if he deemed
                            it wise, to choose the battle ground. At this moment a number of
                            Hancock's staff were absent upon other duty, and as I happened to be
                            close at hand, I was detached from my regiment, furnished with a horse,
                            and directed to join the escort which accompanied him to the field, so
                            as to be in readiness to convey dispatches, to act generally as an aide
                            and do whatever might be needful in this emergency. Our breakneck ride
                            along the dusty road, under a fierce July sun was no light matter to one
                            who had not felt the back of a horse for many months, but the terrible
                            suspense and eagerness to know the result of the battle, drove every
                            other thought from my  mind. We could hear
                            the artillery many miles away; as we came closer, the rattle of the
                            musketry from two directions, both north and west of the town, became
                            incessant and when, shortly before four o'clock, we reached the
                            cemetery, the spectacle which greeted our eyes might well have daunted
                            the bravest commander.
                        The remains of the Eleventh Corps which had been pouring through the
                            streets of the town were arriving in confusion. The remnants of the
                            First Corps, which had lost half its troops during the long fight, were
                            falling back from Seminary Ridge. Thousands of stragglers and fugitives
                            were streaming southward, spreading the story of the defeat. Carts, guns
                            and ambulances filled with wounded encumbered the roads, while the
                            heights on the west and the town itself swarmed with hostile forces.
                        Yet in the midst of this disaster Hancock determined that the place where
                            he stood was the place to fight the battle to a finish. How well I
                            remember his superb calm amid the terrible confusion around him!
                        The President was authorized by law to place any officer over another of
                            higher rank if he deemed it necessary; and it was by virtue of this law,
                            or, perhaps, without any definite recollection of the rank of the two
                            generals, that Meade had ordered Hancock to take command of the field,
                            although Howard was the senior officer. But Howard refused to recognize
                            Hancock's authority. I heard him say: 
                            "Why, Hancock, you can't command here, I am in command, and I rank you!"
                            This misunderstanding might well have led to fatal confusion if the
                            Confederates had then attacked, but they did not. Without settling the
                            question, each general went to work to stay the current of defeat.
                        I had my part in the task of reforming the line. A shattered brigade
                            under Wadsworth was sent by Hancock to hold Culp's Hill, a steep
                            eminence on the right. Buford's cavalry was posted on the left. Hancock
                            sent to Meade a report that the position on Cemetery Ridge was a strong
                            one, but might be easily turned.
                        It was hard work to rally the Eleventh Corps, but at last this was
                            accomplished and the multitudes of fugitives that thronged the roads
                            were halted. The riflemen took their positions behind walls and fences
                            and breastworks hastily constructed; the artillery brought back by the
                            two corps in their retreat was placed in position; other columns in blue
                            came in sight on the roads from the south, the Twelfth Corps
                            under Slocum, part of the Third Corps under Sickles, and finally our own
                            Second Corps.
                        Hancock, after directing these last troops to fall in position on the
                            left, hurried back to Taneytown to report to Meade, and to recommend
                            again that Cemetery Hill should be the battle ground. Meade adopted the
                            recommendation, abandoned his own plan of defense behind Pipe Creek, and
                            late at night  hastened to the front. I
                            had been left at the cemetery with the order to bring to Hancock any
                            despatches that might be sent him prior to his return. I was not needed,
                            however, for this duty, so I remained upon the field and, wearied by my
                            long ride, I lay down among the tombstones and sank into an early
                            sleep.
                        It was after midnight when I was awakened by a group of horsemen entering
                            the cemetery from the Taneytown road and picking their way through the
                            soldiers slumbering under the cypress trees. The moonlight was
                            brilliant, and General Meade (for it was the commander-in-chief who had
                            arrived) tried to realize the position of the army and the character of
                            the battle field while he listened to the reports and suggestions of his
                            officers. He was pale and hollow-eyed, worn out by care and lack of
                            sleep. The clock tower on Seminary Ridge showed where was the center of
                            the enemy's forces. The town at the foot of Cemetery Hill was filled
                            with hostile troops. Meade was at first not altogether satisfied with
                            the field selected, and orders were drawn up to provide for a retreat to
                            Pipe Creek in case it should be necessary. Slocum was directed to
                            command the right and Hancock the center of the Federal army.
                    
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER VI
                        THE BATTLES ON CEMETERY RIDGE
                        THERE were really two battles of Gettysburg: the
                            battle of the first day on the ridges west of the town, in the low plain
                            north of it, and in the town itself; and the battle of the second and
                            third days south of the town on Cemetery Ridge.
                        No part of the first day's battlefield was contested in the subsequent
                            engagements; the Confederates were in full possession of that section of
                            the field. I must now describe the second conflict.
                        It has often been said that no man can see all of a battle, and certainly
                            no maps, pictures, diagrams or descriptions can afterwards exhibit it.
                            The smoke, the fearful tumult, the confusion, the terrible sights and
                            swift changes that flash upon the vision, are impossible to set down or
                            describe. The variations are more rapid and complex than the path of a
                            serpent or the transformation of a cloud. By the time you have sketched
                            the contour of the struggle it is something utterly different, and the
                            general melée of regiment with regiment, company with company and man
                            with man is wholly indescribable.
                        Nevertheless, there are few great battles that are easier to understand
                            than the second and third days' conflicts at Gettysburg. The struggle
                            was more  nearly a unit than most
                            engagements, and there were several positionsone on Little
                            Round Top and others on Cemetery Hill, from which nearly the whole
                            battlefield was visible. This was one of the advantages of the Union
                            position. There was no place from which Lee could so well see the whole
                            of the panorama, or even the positions of his own troops.
                        Immediately south of Gettysburg, and so close to it that the houses of
                            the town climbed the first grade of the ascent, was Cemetery Hill, an
                            eminence about 80 feet high, crowned by the evergreen cemetery from
                            which it had taken its name, and where James Gettys, the founder of the
                            town, as well as most of its deceased inhabitants lay buried. The easy
                            slopes of this ascent could readily be swept by artillery posted on its
                            summit. Southward from the cemetery, perhaps a trifle to the west, and
                            on a slightly lower level, extended the long range of Cemetery Ridge,
                            which, however, about a mile south of the cemetery, sank away nearly
                            down to the intervening valley, and then, perhaps, another mile further
                            on, rose again and terminated in two rocky eminences, Little Round Top,
                            with a bare summit, something over 100 feet above the valley; and still
                            further south, Round Top itself, covered with woodland and 210 feet
                            high. West of the two Round Tops, Plum Run flowed southward, and on its
                            opposite side rose the rough rocks of the Devil's Den; the valley
                            between, through which the run flowed,  is
                            now called from the slaughter of the fatal day, "The Valley of the
                            Shadow of Death." These two miles of Cemetery Ridge stretching south
                            from the Cemetery itself, were occupied by the center and left wing of
                            the Federal army. The whole line of battle may be fairly represented by
                            a fish-hook, the curve of the hook being on Cemetery Hill, the end of
                            the long shank on the left being the two Round Tops, while the point of
                            the hook at the right extremity of the line was Culp's Hill, a steep,
                            rocky eminence crowned by a wood. To the east and south of it flowed
                            Rock Creek. Between Culp's Hill and the cemeterythat is,
                            between the point of the hook and its bend, there was a gap in the ridge
                            where the land sank away into the valley.
                        A street leading southward through Gettysburg up the lower slopes of
                            Cemetery Hill divided near the edge of the town into two roads. To the
                            right was the Emmitsburg road which proceeded toward the southwest, and
                            to the left was the Baltimore Pike, which took a southeasterly
                            direction. The Union line came up close to the junction of these roads.
                            The Emmitsburg road, a short distance further on, branched again, the
                            main road continuing southwestward under Cemetery
                            Ridge to Emmitsburg, and another road proceeding due south over the ridge and then behind it, to
                            Taneytown. The left wing of the Federal army during the second and third
                            days' battles, was on the ridge between the Taneytown and the Emmitsburg
                            roads.
                        
                        Almost a mile west of Cemetery Ridge and nearly parallel with it,
                            extended Seminary Ridge, the north end of which has been described in
                            the account of the previous day's engagement. This ridge was covered
                            with open timber, and later in the day Longstreet's troops occupied its
                            southern stretches with Hill's corps to the north of them. Ewell's line
                            extended eastward through the town of Gettysburg and around to the
                            southeast, and then south, enveloping Culp's Hill and the right wing of
                            the Federal army. It will thus be seen that the Confederates had the
                            outside lines running nearly parallel to those of the Federal army, but
                            forming a longer, and consequently, a thinner line.
                        There were several plans of attack which Lee might have adopted, and we
                            were for a long time uncertain which he would choose. First, he might
                            have determined to move his army southward, around our left flank and
                            thus have compelled us to abandon our advantageous position on Cemetery
                            Hill and Cemetery Ridge. This, as it afterwards appeared, was the plan
                            urged upon him by Longstreet soon after their arrival upon the field,
                            and it offered perhaps a greater certainty of success than any other.
                            Or, if the temper of Lee's victorious army demanded an immediate
                            conflict, he might have massed his troops and made a direct attack upon
                            Cemetery Hill at the bend of the fish-hook, as he himself proposed in
                            the evening of the first day, but was dissuaded by Ewell. He might have
                            attacked  either our left wing near Little
                            Round Top, or our right wing at Culp's Hill, and if he had concentrated
                            his troops, his chances of victory were excellent, but no one would have
                            believed that with a slenderer and longer line than ours encircling us,
                            he would have tried to flank us and attack us at both ends, when we
                            could reinforce either wing with far greater ease than he. Yet this was
                            the plan he adopted. It was the worst of all, and to make it still more
                            hopeless, owing to a series of misunderstandings, the attacks were not
                            simultaneous, but successive, first on our left wing, then upon our
                            right and then on Cemetery Hill.
                        Lee had, however, taken greater risks before and had come out them
                            successfully. At Gaines' Mill, on the Peninsula, at the second battle of
                            Manassas and at Chancellorsville, he had separated Jackson's corps from
                            the rest of his army by long distances, and in each case had won a
                            brilliant victory. To-day he had greater confidence than ever in his
                            invincible veterans. But Jackson was dead, the Federals were alert on
                            the ground where they could see the whole field of battle, and where
                            they were defending their own soil. It is not wise to tempt the gods too
                            often!
                        At daybreak I saw Meade ride out to reconnoiter. At this time the Fifth
                            and Sixth Corps and two brigades of the Third had not yet arrived. Even
                            our own corps, the Second, did not take its position on Cemetery Ridge
                            until six or seven o'clock. An attack at daybreak might have defeated
                            the  Federal forces. It was of the utmost
                            importance for the Confederates to begin the battle immediately.
                        There was, however, great delay. We did not know the cause of it, but it
                            filled us with inexpressible satisfaction. The fact was that Longstreet
                            was not ready. Instead of rushing his men forward with all possible
                            speed, he again argued with Lee in favor of his flanking movement on
                            Meade's left, then urged him to postpone the attack until Pickett's
                            division, which was nearly a day's march distant, should arrive.
                        Later still, Longstreet persuaded Lee to reconnoiter, and then to wait
                            until noon for a brigade which had been doing picket duty; then the
                            direction of the troops was changed and a long circuit made. Their
                            movements were so slow that it was half-past three in the afternoon
                            before Hood's division, which led the flanking movement on their extreme
                            right, was prepared to strike.
                        In the meantime, in our army, the balance of the Third Corps had arrived,
                            as well as the Fifth Corps under Sykes. General Slocum, who commanded
                            the right wing, had his own Twelfth Corps and what remained of the First
                            and the Eleventh posted on Culp's Hill and Cemetery Hill, that
                            is, he held the point and the bend of the fish-hook. Next to him on the
                            left was our own Second Corps, under Hancock on Cemetery Ridge just
                            south of the Cemetery. Further down the shank of the fish-hook was  Sickles' Third Corps, while Sykes' Fifth
                            Corps, which had just arrived, lay resting on Rock Creek at the
                            Baltimore pike. The Sixth Corps, under Sedgwick, had not yet come. When
                            it arrived during the battle, it rested on the eastern slopes of Round
                            Top.
                        Meade evidently did not believe that the first blow was to be delivered
                            at his extreme left against the Third Corps. Sickles' line did not
                            extend as far south as Little Round Top, and although that position had
                            been occupied as a signal station, it was unprotected. It was a point of
                            vital importance, for it was stripped of trees and commanded our entire
                            line on Cemetery Ridge.
                        Sickles' troops were in a depression of this ridge just north of Little
                            Round Top. The ground there was lower than it was at a peach orchard
                            about a mile further west, and Sickles believed that by advancing his
                            line to this latter point he would be in a better position.
                        The difficulty was that by extending his weak line he left an open space
                            between his corps and our Second Corps, which was next to him on the
                            north, and he was also unable to occupy Little Round Top. But Sickles
                            determined upon his own responsibility to advance his troops. We who
                            were with Hancock could see this movement, and we looked with foreboding
                            upon the gap that lay between the Third Corps and our own.
                        Hood's division, on the extreme right of Longstreet's  corps, now began to circle around our
                            left near the base of Little Round Top and when, about five o'clock, he
                            attacked the Federal troops he attempted to capture that important
                            position. We could see one attack made after another on that rocky
                            eminence, and the troops pressed to and fro on both sides, until a
                            heroic charge finally drove the Confederates back into the valley.
                        In the meantime, the battle raged fiercely from the Devil's Den westward
                            to the peach orchard. Our forces were repeatedly driven in;
                            reinforcements from the Fifth Corps were sent to Sickles' support, but
                            one after another they were repulsed. The advance of the Confederates
                            could not be stayed until Crawford's division of that corps and three
                            brigades of Sedgwick's Sixth Corps arrived upon the field. At the close
                            of the fight the general result was the Third Corps was forced back to
                            the low ridge which formed the Federal main line of battle in the
                            morning. Sickles lost a leg near the beginning of the engagement, and
                            Hood was wounded in the arm.
                        The conflict in the Devil's Den, in a wheat field north of it, and in all
                            the broken and rocky country west of Little Round Top, was of the most
                            desultory character, the men fighting singly or in small detachments,
                            climbing trees and firing from among the branches, lying in ambush
                            behind rocks and trunks, stalking each other and picking off their
                            antagonists. "Death lurked behind every leaf and  stone." The slaughter on our side was greater in this part
                            of the field than anywhere else upon this famous battle ground. As I
                            crossed Plum Run with a message from Hancock to the troops beyond it, I
                            saw a gruesome sight. The brook had become red with blood, yet a soldier
                            was stooping over to quench his thirst from the waters, while others
                            were filling their canteens.
                        It was some time after Hood's attack that the other division of
                            Longstreet's corps advanced from Seminary Ridge and assailed Humphrey's
                            division of Sickles' corps on the Emmitsburg road. Humphrey found
                            himself attacked both in front and on the left, and his troops were
                            driven back with heavy loss. Hancock, who, after Sickles was wounded,
                            had been placed in command of the Third Corps as well as of his own, and
                            who for the second time undertook the task of rallying the Federal
                            forces when defeat seemed imminent, hurried forward his own troops to
                            the rescue. I was directed to follow him and convey dispatches. I could
                            see that Humphreys' regiments were so shattered that they could be
                            recognized only by the standards which the survivors were bringing from
                            the fight. Hancock stayed the fugitives and organized a new line of
                            defense.
                        But our main line on Cemetery Ridge itself was now assailed by the
                            Confederate brigades of Wilcox, Perry and Wright. Wilcox stopped close
                            to the crest; Perry was repulsed, but Wright actually  broke the center of the Federal line,
                            captured a number of guns, reached the top of Cemetery Ridge and,
                            looking behind it, beheld a multitude of stragglers encumbering the
                            Baltimore pike in their efforts to escape. Encouraged by the sight, he
                            fought with desperation and held this vital position with obstinate
                            valor during ten long minutes of splendid triumph.
                        Here was a crucial moment when Lee should have hurled every available
                            soldier into the breach. Hill's corps saw the heroic feat and burned to
                            rush to the relief of their comrades, but no order to advance was given
                            and the precious opportunity was gone. I had been dispatched to bring
                            other troops to the rescue of the Federal line. These at last arrived,
                            Wright, unsupported and overwhelmed by the masses of our soldiers, was
                            compelled to retire, and the guns he had taken were recaptured. Thus
                            Meade's main line on Cemetery Ridge again remained intact.
                        But the battle had been disastrous enough to the Federal arms. Sickles
                            has been greatly blamed for his advance movement, which nearly destroyed
                            his own corps and greatly injured the Second and Fifth as well. There
                            was, however, this compensation; the advance line served as a
                            breakwater, and may have prevented Longstreet from holding permanently
                            any part of our main line. If Sickles had kept his original position,
                            and had been driven back from that, the result might have been
                            fatal.
                        
                        The attack of Longstreet's Corps upon our left was only a part of the
                            second day's battle. Lee had directed Ewell to assail our right, as soon
                            as he heard the sound of Longstreet's guns, but Ewell did not begin
                            until two hours after the battle opened not, indeed, until
                            Longstreet's attack was almost over. It was nearly sunset when Johnson's
                            division made an attack upon Culp's Hill. Earlier in the afternoon
                            Meade, anxious to re-enforce Sickles, had ordered the greater part of
                            the troops in this neighborhood to go to his support, and the
                            intrenchments on our extreme right, separated by a small ravine from
                            Culp's Hill, were thus abandoned.
                        Johnson's attack upon the hill was repulsed; but his men found the
                            abandoned earthworks and took possession of them about nine o'clock at
                            night, then advancing still further they came within a stone's throw of
                            the Baltimore Pike, one of our principal lines of communication. On the
                            other side of the pike and close at hand, was our reserve ammunition.
                            Had Johnson known this he could have captured the train and thrown our
                            army into the utmost confusion. But it was now late at night, and he
                            could not understand why the works he had just seized had been
                            abandoned. He feared that he was moving into a trap, and directed his
                            men to retire to the abandoned works and wait for morning.
                        In addition to Johnson's attack upon our right, another assault was made
                            just after sunset by Early's division of Ewell's corps on the east side
                            of  Cemetery Hill, close to the bend in
                            the fish-hook as it turned toward the point. Early had waited until the
                            firing and smoke of Johnson's attack announced that a battle was in
                            progress. He then ordered forward from the town and the fields east of
                            it two of his own brigades. They marched in faultless order up toward a
                            gap between Culp's Hill and the Cemetery, where, however, they were soon
                            exposed to a destructive artillery fire, and their ranks were mowed down
                            by canister. One of these brigades was now compelled to take shelter in
                            the ravine. The other was an organization composed of troops of great
                            ferocity, who had never failed in a charge and were deemed invincible.
                            Each man bore a long knife with the inscription, "In peace, a lamb; in
                            war, a tiger." They were called the "Louisiana Tigers," and they pressed
                            on, forcing their way past a stone wall, leaping over many of the men of
                            the Eleventh Corps who were defending it and driving the others up the
                            slope. Two of the Federal batteries on Cemetery Hill were actually
                            reached and one was captured. A hand to hand fight ensued around the
                            guns, where some of the Tigers were brained with hand-spikes, stones,
                            guidonswhatever could be seized for the purpose. For the
                            redoubtable Hancock was again on hand, and threw Carroll's brigade from
                            his own corps into the melée. The Confederates were left without
                            support, and were driven back with great slaughter.
                        I had been sent with an order from Hancock to  Carroll and directed to remain and bring back word in case
                            further troops were required. I arrived just after the Tigers were
                            driven off, and when the firing slackened I followed their line of
                            retreat a short distance down the slope. The carnage around the guns and
                            along this line had been terrible. It was already dark; the forms of the
                            dying and the wounded that lay around me had grown indistinct, and their
                            moaning as they writhed upon the ground added to the horror of the
                            scene. I was about to return when a low moan close at my side startled
                            me. How well I knew the voice! What is there in a simple sound which
                            distinguishes so clearly the personality of him who utters it from all
                            the rest of the countless myriads of mankind? I could never mistake that
                            tone. It was Albert's. I leaped from my horse and leaned over him. He
                            was lying with his face to the earth, but dark though it was, I could
                            see the waving brown hair I had so often admired, and bending close to
                            his ear I called his name. With a shriek he half raised himself and
                            turned, then fell upon his back gazing at me in terror as if I were a
                            tormenting spirit from that world he was so soon to enter. Some
                            stretcher-bearers were already upon the ground. I called two of them who
                            were passing and asked them to take him to the hospital, and I
                            accompanied them as they bore him back. The poor fellow was too far gone
                            to speak; the blood trickled slowly from a wound in his breast. Every
                            few minutes he would look at me and shudder, until  I took his hand and pressed it, then there was a faint
                            smile, but before we reached the crest of the hill, with a long gasp, he
                            expired. They laid him where he died. I noted the place and after
                            returning and reporting to my corps commander, I stole away during the
                            night, scooped out a shallow grave, and covering the head of my old
                            friend with his coat, I gave him such temporary burial as I could and
                            marked the spot so that it might be found when the opportunity should
                            come for a more fitting sepulture.
                        Although on our side alone nearly twelve thousand men had been killed or
                            disabled during the fatal day, the final struggle was still to come. We
                            felt certain that Lee would renew the attack upon the morrow. Meade held
                            a council of war at the small house just behind Cemetery Ridge, which he
                            had made his headquarters. As I was in waiting upon Hancock I was just
                            outside the building, and I heard something and learned more of what was
                            said and done. The commanders of each of the corps and a few others,
                            twelve in all, were assembled in a little room about twelve feet square.
                            The condition of the troops was disheartening. The First and Eleventh
                            Corps were shattered by the first day's battle; the Third Corps was
                            "used up and not in condition to fight." The effective strength of the
                            forces was reported as only fifty-eight thousand, out of an army of more
                            than ninety thousand men. Yet everybody there was in favor of remaining
                            and accepting the gage of battle if it were offered again.
                    
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER VII
                        THE THIRD DAY'S BATTLE
                        THERE was bright moonlight on the second of July to
                            illuminate the ghastly battlefield. When morning broke on the third day
                            it found in many places the living and the dead sleeping in bivouac
                            together. At the points where the last attacks had been made, on Culp's
                            Hill and the Cemetery, many a soldier on awakening saw at his side the
                            agonized face and the torn limbs of one who would waken no more. Some,
                            indeed, had taken a corpse for a pillow. The parched ground was soiled
                            and stained by the blood of the wounded and slain. The stench from the
                            carnage was beginning to impregnate the air. Corpses of men and horses
                            dotted the slopes and the valley between the two lines of battle.
                            Beyond, the Confederates swarmed upon the heights as well as in the
                            streets of the town. Back of Cemetery Hill, along the Baltimore Pike,
                            there was a confused mass of army trains, while the Geneva cross marked
                            the hospitals where the surgeons were at work on their terrible
                            ministrations to the wounded. Scarcely had the first gray light
                            appeared, when the sound and smoke of artillery upon the Federal right
                            at Culp's Hill announced that the desperate struggle was renewed.
                        
                        The Federal troops which had been called away the day before to reinforce
                            Sickles, and who, when they returned at midnight, found that their works
                            had been occupied by Johnson's men, began their attack for the recovery
                            of these works in the gray of the morning. This was the beginning of an
                            obstinate struggle in the woods and among the hills and rocks which
                            lasted for six hours. So hot and constant was the fire that the trees
                            afterwards died from the effect of the bullets that pierced their trunks
                            and branches. Finally at eleven o'clock Johnson gave up the contest, and
                            the Federal line was left once more intact.
                        From eleven to one o'clock silence reigned over the two armies. Our
                            troops cooked, ate and slumbered, while the Confederates were making
                            ready for the cannonade which was to procede the final assault. I could
                            not but admire the magnificent display of Confederate artillery just
                            before the opening of the great bombardment as I saw it from Cemetery
                            Ridge. Our whole front for nearly two miles was covered by batteries
                            stretching in an unbroken line from near the Seminary to the Peach
                            Orchard, so that the whole of Seminary Ridge in front of us seemed
                            planted thick with cannon. Never before had I witnessed such a sight. A
                            hundred and twenty guns were brought to bear upon our line. Our army had
                            more artillery than the Confederates, but the ground available for its
                            use on Cemetery Ridge was so contracted, that not more than eighty  pieces could be placed in position to
                            return the fire. Just before the artillery duel opened, I could hear
                            through the hot, quiet air, the birds singing merrily in a little copse
                            near by. But at one o'clock, in the midst of their warbling, the signal
                            gun was fired, a cannonade was opened by every piece, and we heard the
                            birds no more. The crests of the two ridges became two long lines of
                            flame and smoke, while a thick battle-cloud settled down upon the fields
                            between. The firing of the Confederates was directed mainly upon our own
                            corps, which was posted on Cemetery Ridge just south of the
                            Cemetery.
                        The air was full of the missiles of destruction of every form and size;
                            screaming, moaning, whirling, whistling, bursting, and the fragments
                            raining to the ground; not a second passed that we could not hear them
                            Sometimes they came a dozen at a time. Often they penetrated the earth,
                            exploding there and sending up great masses of soil and stone. They
                            struck the trees and felled them headlong; struck the walls and hurled
                            the stones over upon our troops crouching behind them; struck the horses
                            belonging to the batteries as those dumb creatures stood helplessly tied
                            up to await their death. I saw a caisson driven by at full speed, with
                            one of the horses galloping in a frenzy upon three legs, the other shot
                            off at the hock. The bodies of our men could be seen, some without
                            heads, some without arms; others torn beyond any semblance of humanity.
                            So fierce was the fire that soon a horde of camp followers and
                            stragglers  was seen pouring down the
                            Baltimore Pike and scattering over the fields in the rear to escape.
                            Meade himself deemed it prudent to retire to Power's Hill till the storm
                            was over.
                        In this artillery duel the enemy would have had a great advantage if his
                            pieces had all been well directed, not only because he had more guns in
                            action, but because our army was massed and concentrated, thus forming a
                            good target, while his batteries were stretched over a space of two
                            miles. The fire, however, should have been wholly directed to the one
                            point where the infantry attack was afterwards to be made, but although
                            it was hottest at that point it was much scattered, and many of the
                            projectiles passed beyond our line and swept the open ground in the
                            rear.
                        At this time Hancock, our own Hancock, the indomitable, "the superb," at
                            the head of his staff and with the pennon flying which bore the trefoil
                            of our Second Corps, rode slowly in front of his line, and by his calm
                            and splendid presence gave new determination to the thousands who were
                            crouching on the ground under the pitiless hail. I followed him with the
                            others of his suite as he passed across the field. At one point his
                            black charger became unmanageable and he was forced to dismount and
                            borrow the horse of an aide to complete his review.
                        How slowly our watches ran during this dreadful cannonade, and while we
                            were awaiting the charge that was to follow! Twenty minutes, forty
                            minutes,  an hour, an hour and a half, and
                            still the fiery storm continued. Our artillery tried to return it, but
                            the target was poor; their batteries were extended over too long a line.
                            And now it was found that our ammunition was running
                            lowsomething must be reserved for the final charge, so the
                            guns ceased firing and new batteries were brought forward in place of
                            those that had been crippled. Hancock, however, who divined well where
                            the assault was to be delivered, directed the batteries of his own
                            Second Corps to continue firing to the last, for he would not suffer his
                            men to be "disheartened by the silence of their own guns."
                        Pickett's division, forty-nine hundred strong, had now come up and was in
                            position in the woods just behind Seminary Ridge, where the men were
                            protected and invisible. Just north of them was ranged a division under
                            Pettigrew, five thousand strong, but which had suffered severely in the
                            first day's battle. And back of these were two North Carolina brigades
                            under Trimble, composed of twenty-five hundred men. Thus the number of
                            troops for the great charge on the third day of the battle was little
                            more than twelve thousand, although batteries were to be pushed forward
                            to protect their flanks, while two brigades were to follow upon
                            Pickett's right, and two others upon the left of Pettigrew.
                        On Cemetery Ridge, overlooking the Emmitsburg Pike, there was a stone
                            wall which followed pretty generally the line of the crest, but at one
                            point,  not far south of the Cemetery
                            where a lower ridge jutted out into the valley, this wall suddenly
                            projected at a right angle toward the pike, then turning again it
                            followed the crest of the main ridge. On this projecting point was a
                            clump of trees and southwest of it, about a quarter of a mile away, the
                            farm house of Codori stood on a little knoll. The charge was to be made
                            past Codori's house, and the central point of attack was this clump of
                            trees.
                        Pickett had formed his three brigades in two lines. Pettigrew's troops
                            advanced on the left of Pickett and a little to the rear with a second
                            line behind. The cannonade now slackened upon both sides. The men who
                            were to make the charge marched forward from the woods, ragged and
                            shabby, indeed, in their worn, rough homespun and old slouch hats, but
                            with their battle flags flying and their bright guns gleaming in the
                            sun. They moved with an easy swinging step, in quick time and with great
                            precision. We could not but admire them as they advanced against us, and
                            I could hear our men exclaim: "Here they come! here comes the infantry!
                            how well they march!" Soon little puffs of smoke issued from the
                            skirmish line as it moved on in advance of the two main lines. The
                            Federal skirmishers out in the valley answered with a faint rattle of
                            musketry as they retired. Then the Federal batteries opened and the
                            advancing troops were enfiladed by the guns on Little Round Top, some
                            distance south, which killed and wounded many at a single discharge. But
                            the ranks closed  up without a pause. The
                            clump of trees which gave direction to the attack was far to the left of
                            Pickett's troops, and when they reached the Emmitsburg turnpike, they
                            wheeled a little to the norht and moved up past Codori's house. This
                            gave them the appearance of drifting, and some of us thought for a
                            moment that the purpose of it was to keep away as far as possible from
                            the artillery fire on their right. But we were mistaken, for in a few
                            minutes they half wheeled again, and resuming their former direction
                            pushed straight forward toward the clump of trees.
                        Pickett's left was in front of the projecting wall, his right stretched
                            to the south of it, while Pettigrew joined him on the north, one brigade
                            in front of the clump of trees and the remainder in front of the retired
                            wall sixty yards further back, while four of his regiments, which had
                            become separated from the rest, were still further north. The Emmitsburg
                            road ran diagonally over the ground where these troops charged.
                            Pickett's division had already crossed this road, while most of the men
                            under Pettigrew and Trimble had yet to pass it. Many were killed and
                            wounded crossing the fences and walls, and others sought protection from
                            the terrible fire by lying on the ground. In front of both of the
                            Confederate divisions was our own Second Corps under Hancock. To the
                            south of us was Stannard's Vermont brigade, belonging to the First Corps
                            in another copse of trees, a little in advance of our main line. Behind
                            the Federal  infantry was the artillery.
                            The men on the first line of this great charge of Pickett's division
                            pushed on until they were within about twenty paces of the projecting
                            wall, when they recoiled for a moment under the terrible fire; then
                            other troops, a little further back, closed in from the right, the
                            second line came up on the rear, and all pressed forward together. The
                            leaders fell but the men pushed on to the stone wall, leaped over it and
                            over the soldiers who were lying behind it and broke clear through the
                            Federal line. There was now a hand-to-hand conflict and men were firing
                            in all directions. Armistead, who had led the second line, put his hat
                            upon his sword and springing forward, cried: "Give them the cold steel,
                            boys!" but soon fell mortally wounded. Excepting Pickett himself, only
                            one out of fifteen field officers in his entire division remained
                            uninjured.
                        The cannonade had destroyed our batteries back of the projecting wall,
                            leaving only one piece that could be worked, and Lieutenant Cushing, who
                            had been fighting more than an hour and a half after he had been wounded
                            in both thighs, and who had run this one remaining gun down near the
                            wall, and was now struck again, this time mortally, cried: "I will give
                            them one shot more," then with a last "Good-bye," he fell dead as it was
                            delivered.
                        The men who had crossed the wall and carried the Confederate flags
                            through the Union line, fought with desperation. But other Federal
                            troops closed  in on every side in thick
                            masses, swarmed around their assailants and fought them with bayonets,
                            clubbed muskets, banner staves and whatever else could be seized and
                            utilized. At last many of the Confederates, completely surrounded, threw
                            down their arms, thousands of prisoners and a "harvest of battle flags"
                            were taken, while the rest fled as best they could. Fearful slaughter
                            was visited upon the fragments that sought to escape. There are those
                            who say they could have walked from the stone wall to the Emmitsburg
                            road on the dead bodies of Pickett's men without touching the ground.
                            Six hundred were buried there in one little field.
                        While Pickett was advancing, Stannard's Vermont brigade, down on our left
                            and in advance of the main line, had wheeled to the right and taken
                            Pickett's troops upon the flank and rear, inflicting great damage and
                            taking many prisoners.
                        It was here that the gallant Hancock fell. He had seen, with a soldier's
                            eye, this point of vantage. He had galloped thither, calling as he went
                            on one of his generals to advance his troops against the head of the
                            assaulting column, and now he came to order the Vermont men to charge
                            and envelop the enemy on the rear. They had already begun to make the
                            movement. The fire was so furious that no mounted man could live in it.
                            Hardly had Hancock come to Stannard's side when he was struck in the
                            groin and fell from his saddle. He lay upon his elbow, with bleeding
                            wound, watching the fight.  Clasping the
                            hand of Colonel Veazey, whose regiment was passing, he cried: "Go in,
                            Colonel, and give it to them on the flank!" With a long hurrah, they
                            rushed forward with their bayonets and it was but a few moments till a
                            mighty shout from the Union line announced that the great charge had
                            been repulsed.
                        Hancock's wound was a ghastly one, like the stab of a butcher's knife,
                            but it was not until the battle was over that he resigned himself to a
                            surgeon, and shortly afterward he dictated this despatch to Meade: "I
                            have never seen a more formidable attack. If the Sixth and Fifth Corps
                            have pressed up the enemy will be destroyed. The enemy must be short of
                            ammunition, as I was shot with a tenpenny nail. ... Not a rebel was in
                            sight upright when I left."
                        Pettigrew's troops which composed the left or northern wing of the great
                            charging line had been subjected as they advanced to a heavy artillery
                            fire in front from batteries that fired first solid shot, then canister.
                            As the attacking line came up the slope, closing in as if against a
                            blinding storm, the batteries opened still more rapidly, and then our
                            infantry poured into the ranks a sheet of leaden hail, mowing them down
                            as grass by a scythe. Their graceful lines were enveloped in a cloud of
                            smoke and dust; "arms, heads, blankets, guns and knapsacks were tossed
                            into the air. Their track was strewn with dead and wounded; a moan went
                            up  from the field, distinctly heard amid
                            the storm of battle."
                        For a moment they staggered under the murderous fire, then they returned
                            it and dashed on with a wild yell, surging forward beyond the projecting
                            wall and the clump of trees, till they reached the retired wall some
                            sixty yards further on, and planted their flags upon the breastworks.
                            The whole Confederate front, which had been more than a mile long, was
                            now compressed into a space of eight hundred yards. But as the two lines
                            came close together a brigade on the extreme left gave away under the
                            terrible fire. The men could not be rallied, but broke and fled. A
                            withering sheet of missiles swept after them and they were torn and
                            tossed and prostrated while they ran. And now a column of our infantry
                            enfiladed them and a second Confederate line moved forward to face this
                            new danger while the troops in front were sinking into the earth under
                            the tempest of fire. They took the positions of the men who had fled or
                            fallen. Finally, when they had reached our last line they saw Pickett's
                            troops defeated and driven away. Then they were ordered back and at last
                            retreated in confusion.
                        While Hancock was conducting his review during the cannonade, I was
                            directed to remain behind near the retired wall and my orders were to
                            report to him the events which occurred at the north end of his line.
                            Thus it was that I was an eye witness of the great charge, of the
                            repulse of Pickett and  the retreat of
                            Pettigrew. I now hastened southward to report to Hancock, but before I
                            reached the place where I expected to find him, I was astonished to see
                            that Stannard's brigade, which projected out in front of our line and
                            had attacked Pickett's men from the south, had now turned to the right
                            about and was facing southward to confront a new danger. For while
                            Pickett was in the midst of his struggle, two other Confederate brigades
                            had been sent forward to support his right flank. One of these did not
                            follow Pickett's movement to the left toward the clump of trees, but
                            confused by the smoke, kept straight ahead, so that there was an
                            interval between the point where Pickett struck our line and the point
                            where the brigade would have reached it had it been able to proceed so
                            far. Stannard's troops were between these two points and Pickett having
                            been driven back, Stannard had now turned his men the other way to face
                            this new advancing column, while the guns from Little Round Top rained
                            destruction on the other side. There was incessant firing going on when
                            I arrived. I asked where Hancock was. I was told he had been wounded,
                            and I had just reached the place where he lay bleeding when I felt a
                            sudden sharp pain in the head and fell from my horse upon the ground,
                            immediately losing consciousness.
                    
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER VIII
                        DOROTHY
                        I COULD not, of course, know how long I remained
                            oblivious to all around me, and when consciousness returned it was hard
                            to say how much was of actual present fact; how much was memory; how
                            much delirium. The wild scenes I had beheld came oneafter another before
                            me. The attack upon Sickles' corps; the drinking of the blood in the
                            waters of Plum Run; Albert's terrible eyes when they first met mine; the
                            artillery duel; Pickett's great charge on the following day and the
                            field that lay covered with Confederate deadthese things
                            gradually and mysteriously transferred themselves into a huge hospital
                            tent, where in some strange fashion the form of Dorothy seemed to be
                            flitting to and fro and stopping at the side of my couch where she
                            appeared to be watching long and earnestly. Though I knew this must be
                            an hallucination, still I was comforted even by her imaginary
                            presence.
                        Gradually my mind became clearer. As the door of the tent fluttered open,
                            I could see, as I thought, trains of ambulances passing on a road close
                            at hand, and wounded men hobbling by on new-made crutches in long files,
                            going somewhereI could not tell where. I knew that we must
                            have won the battle,  for I could see our
                            flag on a flagstaff outside the door of the tent. Then there were squads
                            of men in gray who passed by under guard, with picks and spades and
                            stretchers that were laden with heavy, inanimate loads, and I thought
                            these must be Confederate prisoners going to bury their dead.
                        Sisters of Charity were moving up and down through the rows of cots in
                            the great tent. How good they are, I thought, these Sisters, and how our
                            prejudices against the Roman Church ought to be silent as we think of
                            their self-sacrificing ministrations!
                        But Dorothy, Dorothy, Dorothycould it be she I had seen? What
                            was all the rest by the side of that if it were only true! Ah, no, that was a dream! And again I sank into unconscious
                            slumber. I was once more awakened; this time in unbearable torment. In
                            spite of myself a great groan escaped me. Suddenly I saw rising from the
                            ground at the foot of my cot what must be, as it seemed to me, a spirit.
                            The face and form were Dorothy's, but she was in the garb of a nurse;
                            her checks were very white, and there were dark rings around her eyes.
                            She came to me and did not speak, but leaning over the cot she kissed me
                            on the forehead, just by the side of the bandage that some one must have
                            bound around my head.
                        "Dorothy, is it you," I asked. "How did you come?"
                        "Hush! not a word," she answered, but leaned  over me and smiled. Ah, that smile! I had heard her mocking laughter
                            many a time, but I had never seen on her face a smile like that. All the
                            love in the eyes of the Madonnas could not make up its sum. I knew all
                            now. She had been with me nights and dayshow many I could not
                            tell, and lying at the foot of the cot had watched my slow coming back
                            to life, and now, fallen asleep through utter weariness, she had arisen
                            at the sound of my voice, and at last she was now mine, irrevocably,
                            whether I should live or die. But from that moment there was little
                            doubt which I should. So strong was the call to life that had the wound
                            been mortal to many another, I had in me the will and power to overcome
                            it.
                        Day by day she sat by me and watched over me while I grew stronger,
                            though it was still some time before she would tell me how she had come
                            to join the corps of devoted women who were first upon the battle ground
                            on the day succeeding our final struggle; how she had found me
                            unconscious in the field hospital, where I lay wounded.
                        Gradually I learned what had happened since I parted from her when I
                            enlisted. The night I left her she had gone to her room and had fallen
                            into a swoon. Ethel had come in upon her just as she was recovering
                            consciousness. Dorothy had exacted a promise of secrecy, and her parents
                            suspected as little as I did myself how deeply her heart was engaged.
                            They would have restrained her from  what
                            seemed her mad desire to become a nurse in the field hospitals, but her
                            determination was fixed and it was quite vain to put any obstacle in her
                            pathway. She had engaged in the work with absolute devotion, steeling
                            herself to witness the horrors of these dreadful scenes which I could
                            not myself endure, and at the same time keeping herself constantly
                            informed of the movements of the regiment to which I was attached. It
                            was she who had sent me the newspaper clipping praising our conduct in
                            our first battle. And now she had found me and there she was at my
                            side.
                        There was no moment of suffering after I saw her face and heard her voice
                            that was not a thousandfold compensated by her presence. Those hours of
                            painful convalescence were infinitely more precious than any moments of
                            careless pleasure I had ever known, and I was proud to feel, even though
                            I had deserved it ever so little, that she should believe of me as she
                            did believe with her whole heart, that I had done my duty as a
                            soldier.
                        As soon as I could clearly describe it, I told her of my meeting with
                            Albert and gave her as minutely as possible a description of the place
                            where I had made for him a shallow grave.
                        "We must keep it from Ethel," she said. "She could not bear it."
                        But it was not long after this that she left me for two days, saying that
                            she was called away for a  little while,
                            though she did not tell me until her return where she was going.
                            Albert's body was found and sent to a vault in Philadelphia, where it
                            lay until after the war. Then I went with it to New Orleans, where it
                            was buried in the cemetery where most of the Confederate soldiers were
                            interred, and under a monument whose epitaph recited the soldierly
                            virtue that were the best elements in Albert's character. His mother,
                            who had followed him South at the outbreak of the war, was no longer
                            living. A number of his surviving comrades were present at the
                            interment, but Ethel never knew until all was overthen I told
                            her. She said nothing, but came to me and kissed me, then suddenly left
                            the room. She was ill for some time afterwards, but from this blow, too,
                            she at last recovered.
                        But I am ahead of my story. My wound had produced a serious congestion of
                            the brain, and on several occasions there was a recurrence of
                            unconsciousness and delirium. My convalescence was very slow and the
                            weakness that followed it made it impossible for me to continue in the
                            army. I therefore resigned from the service, but with the determination
                            to re-enter it if I should again become strong enough for active
                            duty.
                        There was now no impediment to the object which was dearer to me than
                            life, and my engagement to Dorothy was soon known to all our
                            friends.
                        Owing to my slow recovery our marriage was 
                            long delayed; delayed indeed until after the war was over. If I had been
                            earlier restored to health, we would have become husband and wife, and I
                            would again have re-entered the service. Dorothy had agreed to that.
                    
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER IX
                        CONCLUSION
                        FOR the sake of history I must retrace the steps of my
                            narrative and relate what happened in the concluding hours of the
                            battle.
                        Lee, who had watched Pickett's charge, had a moment of supreme exultation
                            when he saw the colors of Virginia waving on the crest of Cemetery
                            Ridge, but his joy lasted only an instant, for next he saw his battle
                            flags dropping to the ground and the remnants of his best troops flowing
                            back toward him like a broken wave. His face showed no signs of
                            disappointment and he addressed to every soldier he met words of
                            encouragement.
                        As soon as it was clear that Pickett's charge had failed, the Confederate
                            guns ceased firing in order to save ammunition if Meade should advance.
                            The men held their ground as boldly as possible, though without support.
                            The Federal guns gave them an occasional short for a while and then let
                            them rest.
                        It was anticipated that Meade would make a counter charge after Pickett
                            was overthrown. There has been a great deal of dispute whether this
                            should have been done. The indomitable Hancock wanted the charge made.
                            "There were," he said afterwards, "only two divisions of the enemy on
                            our  extreme left opposite Round Top.
                            There was a gap of a mile that their assault had left, and I believe if
                            our whole line had advanced with spirit it is not unlikely we would have
                            taken all their artillery."
                        It will seem to most of those who can now review the battle in the calm
                            of peace, that Meade ought to have moved up the Fifth and Sixth Corps
                            (the latter had not yet been engaged) as soon as the troops of Pickett
                            and Petttigrew were seen emerging from the woodland, and that when the
                            Confederates were defeated, a counter charge ought to have been made
                            and that if made immediately, as Hancock intimated, a crushing
                            blow would have been delivered that might have well-nigh destroyed the
                            army of Lee. But these two corps were at some distance from the point
                            where the charge was made, the Union losses had been heavy, the
                            confusion around the clump of trees was very great, and some time would
                            have been required to place these troops in position to return the
                            attack at the point where the gap in the Confederate line was filled
                            only by the disorganized remnants that had escaped the fatal charge.
                            Moreover, the success of this counter attack depended largely upon a
                            fact which Meade could not have known, and that was that the ammunition
                            of many of the Confederate batteries was exhausted. Meade did not quite
                            comprehend the greatness of his victory. In his dispatch to Halleck he
                            spoke of it as a "handsome repulse." So desperate had been the contest,
                            and so intense had  been the strain for
                            the last three days, that there was not left enough of energetic impulse
                            to press the charge. After the first favorable moment the opportunity
                            was gone and those who upbraided Meade for the subsequent laxity of his
                            pursuit of Lee back to Virginia were ill advised. We would probably have
                            been defeated had we attacked Lee's army in a position which Lee had
                            chosen. For to the unspeakable honor of the Confederate soldiers it must
                            be said that the morale of the troops had not been broken. They
                            attributed their defeat entirely to the disadvantage of their position.
                            On the following day, the fourth of July (the day that Vicksburg
                            surrendered), Lee had concentrated all his forces on Seminary Ridge and
                            an assault would have been more than hazardous. On this day Lee sent
                            forward his long trains of wounded, and the rain, which began shortly
                            after noon, grew to a storm and fell in blinding sheets. The meadows
                            were overflowed, the fences gave way before the raging streams, while
                            the deafening roar of the elements made it impossible to give orders.
                            The wounded suffered horribly as they were jolted on their rough wagon
                            beds over the mountain roads. On the following morning the whole body of
                            the Confederate army was on its way back to Virginia.
                        The losses on each side, in killed, wounded and prisoners were nearly
                            equal, and together they formed the enormous total of forty-six thousand
                            men. The Union losses were slightly the heavier as the result  of the disastrous conflicts of the first
                            and second days.
                        But Lee had been defeated; no serious invasion of the North was ever
                            possible thereafter, and it became a mere question of time how long the
                            Confederates could hold out against the overwhelming resources of the
                            nation. Their heroic resistance during the two final years of the war
                            was something superb. The "last ditch" into which they were constantly
                            represented as retreating, seemed as illusory as a will-o'-the-wisp, and
                            when the fatal blow was delivered at Five Forks and the surrender
                            followed at Appomattoxthe event for which the North had waited
                            for four yearsthe long struggle cast quite as much credit over
                            the military conduct of the vanquished as it did over that of the
                            victors.
                        We were not as magnanimous after the war as we ought to have been to
                            those who had fought their losing fight with such courage, determination
                            and humanity. But late though it came, the entire nation now pays its
                            tribute to the splendid personal qualities of the men in gray quite as
                            much as to those of the men in blue.
                        And yet history will never raise a doubt as to the right and wrong of the
                            case. Not the legal right and wrong, not the constitutional question
                            whether secession could be justified by the terms of the written
                            instrument. Much may be said pro and con upon this point. The greater
                            question, however, was very simple, and it was stated with a simplicity
                                 that rose to the sublime, by the
                            leader who had borne the chief burden of the struggle.
                        When the Soldiers' Cemetery was to be dedicated at Gettysburg, I was
                            sufficiently restored to health to go with Dorothy and witness the
                            ceremony. We had seats close to the speakers' stand. The speech of
                            Edward Everett was to be the feature of the occasion. Lincoln was there,
                            but he was only to say a few words at the end. Yet, when these few words
                            were spoken, it was clear that nothing else that human lips might utter
                            could ever add to the solemn impressiveness of his sentences. He
                            said:
                        "Fourscore and seven years ago our forefathers brought forth on this
                            continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the
                            proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a
                            great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived
                            and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of
                            that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final
                            resting-place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might
                            live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But,
                            in a larger sense, we cannot dedicatewe cannot
                            consecratewe cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living
                            and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor
                            power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember,
                            what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for
                            us,  the living, rather to be dedicated
                            here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so
                            nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great
                            task remaining before us that from these honored dead we take
                            increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full
                            measure of devotionthat we here hightly resolve that these
                            dead shall not have died in vainthat this nation, under God,
                            shall have a new birth of freedomand that Government of the
                            people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the
                            earth."
                        It was under the influence of these solemn words that we consecrated
                            anew, Dorothy and I, our lives to the service of our country. And in the
                            years that have followed there has been work to do hardly less important
                            than that performed during that desperate battle. In overcoming the
                            forces of public plunder and corruption; in resisting the oppressions of
                            organized capital and its insiduous assaults upon society, we have borne
                            a part which has been modest enough, but perhaps not wholly ineffectual,
                            and we can truthfully say that, apart from the rearing of our own
                            household, the supreme purpose of our lives has been the maintenance of
                            the purity and honor of that great nation which was re-established by
                            the blood of those who perished at Gettysburg and on the other
                            battlefields of the Civil War.
                    
                
                THE END.
