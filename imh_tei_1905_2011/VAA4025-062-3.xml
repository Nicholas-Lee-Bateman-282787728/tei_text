            <p>David McDonald of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>, <country reg="-us">United States</country>
               </placeName> judge for the District of Indiana from 1864 to 1869,
                    has been well described as a Hoosier Pepys. Aside from the diaries which he kept, he wrote an
                    exhortatory autobiographical essay for his son, penned a number of autobiographical letters,
                    and—crowning glory—even made an address "as from the coffin"
                    to guide the lives of those at his graveside.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

            <p>Portions of McDonald's "little black book," the small travel diary which
                    he kept when he was separated from the ledger-type book in which he ordinarily recorded his daily
                    activities, were printed in the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> in 1931.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> They tell, primarily, of his visits to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, D. C. The diary entries which follow are of more interest to Indiana historians, for
                    they relate the day-to-day activities of an active participant and penetrating observer of the
                    Indiana courts and bar during the last year of the Civil War and the first three years of
                    Reconstruction.</p>
            <p>McDonald gives incautious—sometimes explosive—descriptions of the men of
                    importance in Indiana politics and jurisprudence in his day. Furthermore, he gives an interesting
                    account of the life of an Indiana lawyer in the midnineteenth century. The practice of law brought
                    many satisfactions; but it also involved much unrewarding drudgery, such as traveling to distant
                    courts for trials which were postponed and lodging four-to-a-room at inns with other lawyers and
                    clients. While he took tea with many of his legal foes, he was in danger of being forced to exchange
                    shots <list type="footnotes">

                    particular importance because of his role as a constitutional interpreter. Indiana was an alleged
                    hotbed of pro-Southern influence, so the district court was deeply involved with civil liberties
                    cases concerning the Copperheads. It was his court, for instance, which called upon the <placeName>

                    the most important constitutional opinion to come out of the Civil War.</p>
            <p>David McDonald was born near Millersburgh, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, in 1803, the eighth of twelve children. In 1817 the family moved to a farm near <placeName>

                    </placeName>, in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Daviess</region>
                    </placeName> County, Indiana. In 1829, after several years as a "new light
                    preacher" and a schoolmaster, he was urged by a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> lawyer to study law. The next year he began his own practice, earning $250
                    in fees for the entire year.</p>
            <p>In 1833 he was elected to the Indiana legislature but found "It was time very uselessly
                    spent; and I never wanted to go back to the Legislature. Besides I ran a great risk of contracting
                    vicious habits. Debauchery of every kind prevailed among the members."<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                    He was prosecuting attorney for the Tenth Judicial Circuit from 1834 to 1837 and was circuit judge
                    for the next fourteen years.</p>
            <p>Though lacking a college education, he was professor of law at Indiana University through the
                    1840's. Despite McDonald's protest he was given an honorary doctorate when he
                    retired. He practiced law in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> from 1853 until 1864, when he was appointed <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> district judge, "the most fortunate occurrence" in his life. In 1857
                    he was elected president of Asbury University at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Greencastle</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but he declined because he was not an orthodox Methodist.</p>
            <p>Most of the legal cases which McDonald mentions prior to his appointment to the federal bench were in
                    the Indiana circuit courts, the principal forum for state questions. These fifteen courts had
                    excessively wide jurisdiction, so each drew outstanding counsel from throughout the state. Under the
                    Constitution of 1851 the state judges—at the justice of the peace, circuit, and supreme
                    court levels—were all elective rather than appointive. This accounts in part for the
                    contempt which McDonald expresses for some who were far <list type="footnotes">

                    federal judgeship was much more desirable than a state position because the federal judge was
                    virtually assured of tenure for life, and he could instruct the juries rather than being dictated to
                    by them as were the elective judges on the state circuits.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the beginning of the federal judiciary there was a hazy line between the jurisdictions of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> district and circuit courts. It was intended that the district courts should handle
                    federal cases where punishment would be by fines not exceeding one hundred dollars or prison terms
                    of not more than six months, while the circuit courts should hear more serious cases and appeals
                    from the district courts. In Indiana, however, as in many states prior to 1869, federal cases might
                    be initiated in either court. There was no separate panel of judges for the Seventh Circuit, so at
                    circuit court time Judge McDonald, as district judge, sat with Justice David Davis of the <placeName>

            <p>The journal from which the following extracts are taken begins with the year 1864 and continues
                    almost daily until September 30, 1868. Many pages at the end were cut out, and occasional bits of
                    writing at the book's spine demonstrate that Judge McDonald had continued this diary beyond
                    that date. There may have been enough pages to take him near his death on August 25, 1869. With only
                    two exceptions the diary accounts for every day of its four-and-a-half years. The extracts presented
                    here give most of McDonald's comments on legal matters and on national and state political
                    affairs, omitting many family and personal comments. Most of the items omitted, aside from trivial
                    phrases such as "Did nothing today worth recording," are comments on his own
                    misery from a spinal disease, on the ill-health of his family, and on his own religious struggles.
                    McDonald was a Methodist socially, but a Unitarian philosophically, so nearly every Sunday he seemed
                    to devote to speculation either about leaving the Methodists or returning to them.</p>

                                        supplied in brackets whenever McDonald seemed to have omitted them
                                        unintentionally. Since the author generally either hyphenated or divided the
                                        words "today" and "tomorrow," the editor has
                                        adhered to the latter practice in doubtful or marginal situations. Modern usage
                                        has been followed whenever it was impossible to distinguish between
                                        McDonald's capital and lower case "s." Superior
                                        letters have been brought down to the line. Flourishes and obviously
                                        unintentional repetitions have been omitted. Words which McDonald underlined
                                        have been reproduced in italics. In a few instances the author failed to place
                                        periods at the end of sentences. These have been added in brackets. Ellipses
                                        have been used to indicate deletions from the journal unless a break in the
                                        diary can be indicated instead by a jump in the date. If the deleted portion
                                        would have comprised approximately a paragraph or more, a line of ellipsis marks
                                        has been given. If part of a sentence is omitted, three marks are used. If one
                                        or more sentences, but less than a paragraph, are deleted, eight marks are
                                        given. Important but comparatively unknown individuals whose names appear in
                                        this journal have been identified in footnotes. In other instances full names or
                                        initials have been added in brackets whenever possible the first time the name
                                        appears. The spacing of the original journal has been somewhat modified and
                                        standardized.</item>

                                            not I hope, operate unfavorably to my present application. None of those
                                            who, like houseflies have followed you for the last two years withersoever
                                            you went, have felt more regard for you than I have,—nor can I
                                            see that because you have already given distinguished place to one or two
                                            citizens of Indiana, you ought therefore to favor them a second time. I was
                                            a Henry Clay Whig as long as whiggery lasted. When it died I went to the
                                            Republicans as the best thing I could do. You may remember that I rode sixty
                                            miles from a court where I met you to vote for Henry Clay. I have never
                                            committed the sin of democracy giving all my efforts to my profession. I
                                            have not been much of a politician and while I concede that politicians
                                            ought to be preferred in politics, I claim for those who have followed the
                                            law only a like preference in judicial office. I am too modest to mention my
                                            attainments in the law and top proud to plead poverty. I hope you will
                                            appoint the best man. But if you fail to appoint me, I shall be sorry both

                                    evening, when it became certain he had the small pox; and he went home. Who may
                                    suffer for all this remains to be seen. I was vaccinated about 34 years ago. Whether
                                    this will protect me I know not.</p>

                                    that neither in our Circuit Court nor Common Pleas have we a Judge that can give us
                                    the clean law. Last term we had the celebrated <hi rend="i">boulder case</hi> before
                                    Judge [Fabius M.] Finch. He decided every thing against us, though we carried the
                                    case before a jury. He gave a new [?]. This week we managed to get Judge Perkins to
                                    try the case. He decided it in our favor so that the plaintiff got out of Court
                                    before he got to a jury. Perkins is by far the best Judge about here.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>

                                    I think he will if not influenced by the traitors who will vote for him. But whether

                                    as vile traitors as any in the South, and much more inexcusable than they. I write

                        <p>Thursday was a rainy day. However, there were more people to hear us than could get
                                    into the Court house. I spoke to them on secession, the war &amp;c. better than
                                    I thought I could. J. W. Ray followed me in a very good speech. I think we

                        <p>Tues. [Oct.] 11. This is election day for all state and County officers and members

                                    The election passes peaceably. But on the Union side, it is melancholy to think how
                                    much fraudulent voting there clearly is. It is barefaced too. I abhor the doing evil

                                    corrupt, rotten. Will not these men who get elected to-day by corruption and fraud,

                        <p>Sat. 29. To-day I am engaged in trying the case of Myars vs. Cones et ux. before a

                        <p>This evening, Mr. Porter and I went to Camp Morton and had an interview with
                                    Castleman, the traitor, whom Judge Breckenridge, last week employed us to defend. He
                                    is a young man, and avows himself a rank rebel. He has been a Capt. in the rebel
                                    army. He is a traitor and deserves to be hung. I doubt, however, whether he is
                                    guilty of the crime with which he is charged—that of being a spy. He
                                    talks about honor. O chivalry! What I mean to get from him is <hi rend="i">money.</hi> Unless that comes freely he gets no defense from me.</p>
                        <p>Mon. 31. Argued the case of Myars v. Cone, and gained it. The rest of the day I spent

                        <p>Tues. [Nov.] 1. To day we have three courts grinding—the Common Pleas, the
                                    State Circuit Court, and the U.S. Circuit Court. And I am nearly run to death

                        <p>Wed. 23. In my office nearly all day. [Senator Thomas A.] Hendricks came there to
                                    talk about the District Judge-ship. It is strange that always when I have sought
                                    office, Democrats have helped me more than my own party. I do not now know a
                                    Democrat of any consequence in the State that does not wish to see me get this
                                    office. This is not because I am inclined to their political faith, but because they
                                    believe I would treat them fairly in Court. I confess I am proud to believe that all
                                    parties agree that I would make a just, competent Judge.</p>
                        <p>Sat. 26. In my office all this day.</p>
                        <p>For 4 or 5 months past, it has been the understanding by express agreement with Judge
                                    Selden, that Mr. Porter should go to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                                    </placeName> next month to argue before the U.S. Supreme Court, the case of Sheets
                                    vs. Selden et al. To-day Mr. P. intimates that he will not go.—it will
                                    cost him $200., he says, to clothe himself so as to go decently. I hoped
                                    he would go on my account, in regard to my application for the District Judgeship.
                                    Alf. Harrison and his myrmidons will be there, to urge Mr. Howland's
                                    wretched claims; but there is not in this wide world a man—not even Mr.
                                    Porter, my law-partner—who will take that trouble for me. Well, it is a
                                    consolation to think that I never knew a man less dependent on any mortal than I am
                                    for all I am or have been or hope to be. But the want of a little sympathy, a little
                                    help may loose [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] me this judgeship. I keenly feel it.</p>

                        <p>After noon I went to see T. A. Hendricks to get his opinion on the necessity of my

                        <p>Thurs. 15. This day with me begins a new era. I am never again to practice law. Warm
                                    congratulations flow in on me from all quarters. To day I took possession in the TJ.

                                    This is the consummation so long wished by me. It is more than I hoped. It is like
                                    some of the fond creations in the Arabian Nights' Entertainment. So it
                                    probably was two years ago with Caleb B. Smith—So perhaps it was a year
                                    ago with Albert S. White. So it may be with me soon. Therefore I must take care not
                                    to be puffed up nor proud, nor forget that I, too, am mortal. But I must be humble
                                    and thankful, and give all the praise and the glory to the Good Being to whom I owe
                                    all things. And I must see that I perform my official duties diligently, wisely and
                                    faithfully; and that no man receive injustice at my hand. God help me thus to do!</p>

                        <p>Sat. 17. Working away in my new position all day. This evening I received my
                                    commission as U.S. Judge, and was sworn into office. So ends my old condition; so
                                    begins my new.</p>
                        <p>Tuesday 20. The U.S. Circuit Court begins here to-day. I alone presiding. Little
                                    done. At 3 o clock P.M. I charged the grand Jury.</p>
                        <p>Frid. 23. In Court to day. Two jury trials, but no verdict[.]</p>
                        <p>Tues. 27 to Sat. 31. I held Court all this time. Tried a few criminal
                                    cases—Sentenced John Tucker to the penitentiary for ten years for robbing
                                    mails, and another five years for passing counterfeit
                                    "greenbacks."…</p>
                        <p>Thus, I come to the close of the year 1864. A varied, checkered year to me. During
                                    it, I have had the extremes of distress and of joy. At first sickness, sorrow, and
                                    almost death to some of my children—then trembling anxiety about being
                                    appointed U.S. Judge—then seeing all my children in health and with a
                                    little better prospect of worldly prosperity than before—then in the last
                                    month of the year, the crowning joy of my appointment as U.S. District Judge. Thus,
                                    sorrow may continue for a night, but joy cometh in the morning. To God be all the
                                    praise!</p>

                        <p>This week I have been alarmed to learn that a bill is pending in Congress to abolish

                                    President, he was so drunk as not to know what he was about. He disgraced himself
                                    and the nation in the eyes of the world. He now swears to tetotalism [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>]. I hope he will stick to it. But ought he not to resign as the only

                        <p>At noon to-day a vast crowd assembled at the State house square. Such passion, such
                                    sorrow, such indignation, I never saw before. Hand bills were posted expressing
                                    "Death to all traitors." Every man seemed full of fury. Speeches
                                    to the crowd were made by Governor Morton and others. All over the city public and
                                    private houses were draped in mourning. Stores and shops were closed. All business
                                    was suspended. And a dreadful gloom and portentous fury marked every face. A
                                    thousand rumours were flying. Men seemed stupified with mingled surprise, sorrow,
                                    and rage. What wonder? Since Christ was crucified so diabolical an act has not been
                                    committed on earth. Since the world began, so many people simultaneously, earnestly,
                                    and deeply, never mourned over the death of one man.</p>
                        <p>If Washington was good and great, Lincoln was equally so. If Washington was inspired
                                    by a pure and lofty patriotism, he was not superior to <placeName>

                        <p>At 3.30 P. M. a vast congre[g]ation assembled at Wesley Chapel to hear addresses on
                                    the occasion of the death of the late President Lincoln. Myself, Governor [Joseph

                                    satisfied myself—and I hope the crowd—tolerably. The thing
                                    went off well.</p>
                        <p>Mon. 17. I spent this forenoon at my rooms in the U.S. Court house; the afternoon in

                                    Fred, still lies insensible with little hope of recovery. It is now certain that
                                    [John] Wilkes Booth killed Mr. Lincoln. And it seems probable that both the

                                    </placeName> planned, or at least encouraged, the damnable act.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lincoln's murder will not go unavenged. The rebel leaders and others
                                    will suffer for it. They ought to suffer for it. Rebels, who lay aside honorable
                                    warfare, and take to assassination and murder, ought all to be hanged.</p>

                        <p>Wed. 19. This is the funeral of the lamented President Lincoln. It is observed in
                                    most of the States under Governors' proclamations. Here the obsequies were
                                    very solemn and imposing. At 12 o'clock there was divine service in all the
                                    churches. These were festooned in crape and arrayed in other funereal insignia. At
                                    1.30 P. M. a procession was formed. It passed along various streets, and rested at
                                    the Governor's Circle. There it appeared to me [was] the largest assemblage
                                    I ever saw. The circle was full of people; and many, not able to get within the
                                    enclosure, occupied the adjacent streets and houses. The churches around were
                                    filled, and speakers addressed the people in the churches, and the vast multitude in
                                    and around the circle. And this is the last of Mr <placeName>

                        <p>Sat. 29. Spent the day at home. At 8 P. M. went on a special train to meet, at the

                                    immense; but the day was so rainy as to derange all plans for processions
                                    &amp;c. I went home, and, being weary and sleepy, stirred out very little all
                                    day. Great preparation had been made here for honoring the memory of President
                                    Lincoln. Costly arches, funereal drapery, and all sorts of emblems of woe filled all
                                    the city. Almost every house was festooned in black. Such a mourning never was known
                                    here. But the incessant rains kept the people within doors mostly. The train is to

                                    to indicate that my life may soon end. I held Court to-day.</p>
                        <p>Tues. 9. This morning, Judge David Davis arrived and joined me in holding Court.</p>
                        <p>To day it is said that the authorities have fixed on Friday the 19th instant for
                                    hanging Bo[w]les, Milligan, and Horsey, the "Sons of Liberty",
                                    tried last Fall. I am sorry to hear it, not that they are not traitors, but that
                                    there is too much doubt of their having been convicted by a Court of competent
                                    jurisdiction. Judge Davis has the same fears I have on this topic. We will try to
                                    induce the President to delay the execution till the Supreme Court shall pass on the
                                    question. But our attempt will probably be unavailing, and perhaps be much

                                 <hi rend="sup">40</hi> Dr. William A. Bowles, Lambdin P. Milligan, and
                                            Stephen Horsey, prominent leaders in the Indiana Sons of Liberty, were tried
                                            for treason by a military court in October, 1864, and were sentenced to be
                                            hanged. Davis and McDonald recognized that it would be fruitless to issue a
                                            writ of habeas corpus, for the military authorities would ignore it. Thus
                                            they agreed to differ in their view of the case so the questions troubling
                                            them could be sent immediately to the Supreme Court. They asked if a writ
                                            should be issued, if those convicted should be discharged, and if military
                                            commissions have jurisdiction when civil courts are sitting. Meanwhile they
                                            requested a reprieve from President Johnson until the higher court could
                                            respond to these questions. When Johnson refused, they urged Governor
                                            Morton, who had originally favored bypassing the civil courts, to persuade
                                            the President. Bowles and Horsey were pardoned by Johnson in 1866, the same

                                    course may bring on us much popular abuse. But so well persuaded are we that the

                                    Seward, by a court martial, and secretly. What folly and madness! What unpardonable
                                    disregard of the Constitution ! These men all deserve death; but why not put them to

                                    them, nor would do so if we could. And yet there is danger of a mob disturbing us on
                                    this stupid notion that has seized the public mind. The truth, I learn, is that Gov.

                                    the execution. The President I suppose, will grant the request. Then the mob will be
                                    furious, and will probably blame me and Davis for what Morton will have effected.

                                    news-papers are getting strong in opposition. All the political papers of N. Y.,
                                    except the Times, are outspoken against it. So are the Gazette and Commercial of <placeName>

                        <p>Wed. 17. In Court. A very warm day. A thunder storm at night.</p>
                        <p>President Johnson has commuted the punishment of Horsey from death to imprisonment
                                    for life. He reprieves Bowles &amp; Milligan till June 2.</p>
                        <p>Judge Davis, to-day, told me a curious judicial story. It was thus: One of the
                                    Supreme Judges on the Bench at the time, told Judge Davis that when the Dred Scott
                                    case was tried in the U.S. Supreme Court, those Judges who favored the political
                                    doctrine of that case, proposed to discuss only the question of jurisdiction, and
                                    let the case go off on that point alone. But Judge [John] Mclean [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>], who was a vain, pompous man, insisted on entering on the whole question
                                    of slavery. Then said Taney, "if you will do that, I will do so
                                    too." The consequence was the most ingenious pi[e]ce of legal sophistry by
                                    Taney ever written, a most weak answer to it by McLean, and one of the most damnable
                                    and injurious decisions ever made by a Court.<hi rend="sup">41</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thurs. 18. This day I spent in Court. At night, Judge Davis, A. G. Porter, J. E.
                                    McDonald, and his wife took tea with us.</p>
                        <p>Frid. 19. In Court this morning, Judge [James] Morrison, chairman of a committee
                                    appointed some days ago, reported resolutions concerning the death of Mr. Lincoln.
                                    These were supported in addresses by T. Hendricks, Judge [Jeremiah] Sullivan, J. E.
                                    McDonald, J[ohn] S. Ketcham, A. G. Porter, W. P. Fishback. Judge Davis responded in
                                    a very appropriate address; and the Court adjourned.</p>

                                    only a part of the evidence for the U.S. to-day. But what we heard makes a case of
                                    awful murder, and proves Scott guilty beyond question. The trial was adjourned till

                        <p>At 3 P. M. Judge Davis and I went to Judge [Jeremiah] Morrison's where we
                                    took tea, and staid [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] till after sunset. We had a big and long
                                    talk. After it was over, I was struck with the fact that it consisted wholly of the
                                    historic—anecdotes of the Past—each of us "shouldered
                                    his crutch, and showed how fields were won." Sad proof that we are all
                                    growing ancient—within the realm of "narrative old

                                        account, but merely emphasizes the importance of simultaneous political
                                        pressures in persuading the justices to speak out upon an issue which the

                        <p>Mon. 29. Spent the whole day on the trial of Scott. The U.S. evidence was closed this
                                    evening. A case was made than which a stronger could hardly be imagined. It is

                        <p>Sat. [June] 3. This day, the jury found Hedrick guilty of murder. This is three
                                    persons already found guilty of the murder of Captain Eli McCarty. Several others
                                    are yet to be tried.</p>
                        <p>Mon. 5 to Sat. 11 This solid week I spent in Court. On Monday, Whitesides &amp;
                                    Scales were put on trial for the murder of McCarty. The jury found them guilty on
                                    Tuesday. Five of these murderers now stand convicted in our Court. If it were left
                                    to me, I would, at once, pronounce sentence of death on them all. There is, however,
                                    one legal point on which possibly some doubt may exist. And Judge Davis is not
                                    willing to pronounce the sentence till he can get the opinion of all the Supreme
                                    Judges on that point. On this account alone, sentence will be delayed till

                                    man, who it seems has been cohabiting with a negress, pleaded guilty to an
                                    indictment for passing a forged $50. "greenback." I
                                    deferred his sentence till tomorrow.</p>

                                    distant about 16 miles. It was a pleasant half hours' run nearly all the
                                    way down the shore of Niagara. We all stopped at the Cataract House—a
                                    magnificent hotel on the river above the great Falls.</p>
                        <p>This day and the following, I went round and saw all the rare sights—goat

                                    Falls, every thing. But why attempt a description of what thousands have attempted,
                                    and what after all is indescribable. To have an adequate notion of these wonders,
                                    one must see them.</p>
                        <p>To-day our Judicial Convocation assembled in the ball room of the Cataract house.
                                    Only 11 Judges were present. The consulta[t]ion chiefly concerned salaries, and the
                                    creation of an intermediate Court of errors, so as to relieve the Supreme Judges of
                                    some of their labors. We agreed on a plan to be placed in the hands of our friends
                                    in Congress. Our Session lasted only two days. On Thursday night it ended.</p>
                        <p>Now let us take a look at 10 of these Judges:</p>
                        <p>1. H. H. Leavitt of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. He must be over 70 years of age. He looks feeble; and he is evidently
                                    on his last legs. I think he never was a great lawyer. As he now is I see nothing in
                                    hime [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] but a good man with a fair share of common sense,
                                    common honesty, and common law—all mingled together. His excellent lady
                                    looks nearly as old as the judge. They seem an affectionate old couple, who having
                                    "clomb the hill thegither", are now going quietly down on the
                                    other side of it, to repose in the valley.<hi rend="sup">46</hi>

                        <p>2. Judge Willson, of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. He is a large, tall man, reasonably corpulent, has a red face, and
                                    somewhat commanding appearance. He must, I think, be largely over sixty. He looks
                                    like an upright judge; and I esteem him a good, pleasant man; but I fail to discover
                                    in him any thing remarkable either in intellect, law, or literature. He evidently
                                    feels his consequence, and seems fond of letting folks know that he is rich.<hi rend="sup">47</hi> His wife is a nice <list type="footnotes">

                                    P. O. It appears to me that I ought to save this poor boy, if I can consistently
                                    with official duty. …</p>
                        <p>Tues. [Nov.] 7. …Our Federal</p>
                        <p>Courts begin to-day. Judge Davis is with us. I charged the grand Jury. We heard
                                    motions, and adjourned.</p>
                        <p>Fri. 10. I fasted to-day. In Court. At night at a party at Roaches. The four Supreme
                                    Judges, Judge Davis, Judge [Jeremiah] Smith, and a few lawyers composed the company.</p>
                        <p>Sat. 11. In Court. Judge Davis trying my clients, Williams, Jackson, et al.
                                    gu[e]rrillas, for robbing a post Office. I do not sit in the case.</p>
                        <p>Sun. 12. …When preaching was</p>
                        <p>over I went with Judge Davis to Judge Morrison's where we dined and spent
                                    the evening. Col. [Clement B.] Simonson was of our party—all four old
                                    men. The conversation was almost entirly [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] of past
                                    incidents—historic—It reminded me of Goldsmith's old
                                    soldier, who "shouldered his crutch, and showed how fields were
                                    won."—It brought stron[g]ly to my thoughts, the phrase of
                                    another poet—"Narrative old age."</p>
                        <p>Tues. 14. At work in Court to-day. At night at a <hi rend="i">dinner</hi> at Senator
                                    Hendricks'. This affair was after the fashion of <placeName>

                        <p>Wed. 15. Working in Court again to-day. But nothing on hand of great consequence.</p>
                        <p>I trust that these times I am living free from wilful sin. Though my official duties
                                    have induced me to omit attending the daily prayer meeting, which, I believe are
                                    still in progress.</p>
                        <p>Frid. 17. In Court all day. I fasted till sundown; and felt well.</p>
                        <p>Judge Davis leaves us to-night. I have a long docket to close up, which I must do by
                                    myself.</p>

                        <p>Mon. 27. In Court to-day. Afternoon began the trial of Arnold for counterfeiting.
                                    Finished the evidence, and deferred the argument till tomorrow.</p>
                        <p>Tues. 28. Hard at work in Court all day, and till 10 P. M.</p>
                        <p>Sat. [Dec.] 2. In Court to-day till noon. With the last few days I have sentenced
                                    numerous malefactors to the penetintiary [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>]. It is a sad thing.

                        <p>Mon. 4. This is the day on which our Law School was to begin. Only three students
                                    appeared! The thing is a failure.</p>
                        <p>I had no Court to-day.</p>
                        <p>Frid. 8. I have organized a private law class, and am now teaching it daily.</p>
                        <p>I held Court this afternoon, and tried and decided an action of ejectment.

                        <p>Frid. [18.] Judge Davis left us to night for home. A fine Summer like day. But this
                                    awful aching in my flesh &amp; bones is still on me, and I grow more and more

                        <p>Frid 25 Sat. 26 I spent these days trying the curious case of Roberts v.

                        <p>Friday. [June] 1. Sat. 2. I spent these days in Court. Trying criminal
                                    cases—mostly about passing Counterfeit money—sending wretches
                                    to penitentiary nearly every day.</p>
                        <p>Mon. 4 Tues. 5 Wed. 6 Th. 7. I spent these days in Court, trying important caseses
                                        [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>]. The 6th &amp; 7th were spent in hearing Jo. E.

                        <p>Mon. 11 to Sat. 16. This has been to me a solid week of work in the U.S. Circuit
                                    Court. I have tried numbers of cases, and sentenced several men to the penitentiary.</p>
                        <p>Wed. 20. My court is about over; and I am about done over.</p>

                        <p>Wed. [July] 4. "The glorious fourth." There was a great
                                    soldier's gathering here to-day, and the usual processions and display. I
                                    was too unwell to take any part in it.</p>
                        <p>Th. 5. I finally adjourned my courts to-day. It is very warm, and I am very poorly.
                                    So I lurked about my house nearly all day.</p>

                        <p>I am now positively doing nothing. No official business to do, and too unwell to
                                    enter upon unofficial business. Am I any better off than when I practised law, and
                                    was run to death all the time?</p>

                        <p>Th. 19. Spent the day in my study revising my law lectures. I have concluded to teach
                                    law school again next Winter. I fear my health will hardly support the labor. But
                                    "famine drives the wolf from the wood." So I must prowl.</p>
                        <p>Sat. 21. Things politically look bad. [James] Speed the atty general, and Harlin
                                    [James Harlan] the Secretary of the Interior have resigned on account of the policy
                                    of President Johnson. The President, it is now clear, turns traitor to those who
                                    elected him, and goes over to the Democrats. I suppose he is still a Union man. But
                                    he retains his ancient demagoguery. But he designs, I think to resuscitate the old,
                                    rotten Democratic Party, and turn his back on all others.</p>

                        <p>Human depravity has ever been an enigma. Perhaps God gives bodies to us like rough

                                    the sculptor on the marble, till we bring them to form and comeliness. Perhaps it is
                                    our own fault, if we never bring them to the perfection of which the rude material

                                    no instance in modern times of such barbarity on so large a scale towards prisoners.
                                    O the hell hounds, the demons! And these are the men whom that prince of demagogues,
                                    Andrew Johnson wishes to take under his special protection, and to make rulers of

                        <p>Mon. 10. In my study to-day. At night President Johnson arrived here. Grant, [David
                                    G.] Farragut, Seward, [Gen. Lovell H.] Rousseau &amp; others were with him. A

                                    wounded several others.</p>
                        <p>Sat. [Oct.] 6. I spent this day doing little. I received my quarter's

                        <p>Tues. 9. This is election day. Pa. O. &amp; Ind. elect members of Cong. to day.
                                    Great excitement. Will the wretched policy of our drunken President be sustained?
                                    That's the question.</p>
                        <p>Wed. 10. Well the political dust has cleared away a little, and we begin to see the
                                    result of yesterdays election. Pa. O. &amp; Ind. have declared emphatically
                                    against the President and the Democracy. I hope that this result saves the Union.</p>
                        <p>Mon. 15. To-day our Law-school begins with a fair prospect of a good attendance. But
                                    alas! I am sick. Can I live through 4 1/2 months of hard work?</p>
                        <p>Wed. 17. Th. 18. I spent these two fine autumnal days. [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] in my
                                    horse mill round in our Law School. This school promises well. We have now about 30
                                    students, with the expectation of more. If only my health will hold out how glad I
                                    will be.</p>

                        <p>Mon. 22 to Sat. 27. Spent this solid week in my Law School, nothing happening worth

                        <p>Thurs. [Nov.] 1 to Sat. 3. My law school is now engrossing my attention. I am not
                                    [well]; but I am not worked hard.</p>
                        <p>Tues. 6. …</p>
                        <p>The Fall term of my Court begins to day. I went into Court at 2 P. M. and impannelled
                                    the Grand Jury. But was so sick, I had to go home. It was an awful day of sickness.</p>
                        <p>Wed. 7. Suffered all day from nausea and dizziness. Could not hold court, nor hear my
                                    law class. Lay on my back nearly all day.</p>
                        <p>Th. 8. I hope I am getting well. I sat in court a few hours, and lectured the Law
                                    Students, of whom we have now 28[.]</p>
                        <p>Fr. 9 to Sat. 10. Spent these days in Court and in Law-School doing as well as I
                                    could, but very unfit for either.</p>
                        <p>Sun. 11. …</p>
                        <p>To day Judge Willson of the U.S. Circuit &amp; District Courts at <placeName>

                                    about 60 years.</p>
                        <p>Mon. 12 to Sat. 17 This has been a hard week to me. I have held Court and taught Law
                                    School every day, and been every day too sick to do either. The time passes
                                    h[e]avily, gloomily.</p>
                        <p>Sun. 18. Sick. Kept my couch all day. Pains in my ankles and legs. Dizzy head.
                                    Nausea. How is this to end? The prospect is very sad. If I must adjourn my Court and
                                    give up my Law School, what shall I do? It would seem like "the last of

                        <p>Mon. 19 to Sat. 24. A severe week to me. Sick, sick.</p>
                        <p>I attempted on Monday &amp; Tuesday to hold court and attend to my Law School,
                                    but could do neither. I lay on my back nearly all the week. …</p>
                        <p>Things seem very uncertain with me now. I commit soul and body to the author of my

                        <p>In the afternoon, I attended our Law School, and lectured the students, and went home
                                    through the rain feeling almost well.</p>
                        <p>Fr. 7 Sat. 8. These days I spent in my usual way. Too sick to run about much, I lie
                                    on my back at home till after 12 o'clock. Then I walk to my rooms at the P.
                                    O. Building, hear my law students an hour or so, then walk home and lie on my back
                                    till bed time.</p>
                        <p>Mon. 10 Tues. 11 Wed. 12 Th. 13 Fr. 14 Sat. 15 It was cold all this week. And during
                                    it, I was engaged as usual in my law school, and lying at home on my couch somewhat
                                    sick, but seeming to grow a little better.</p>
                        <p>Tues. 18 to Sat. 22. These days were characterized by nothing remarkable as to me. I
                                    spent the most part of each home on my couch, but every afternoon, and twice after
                                    night, either lecturing my law students or hearing them recite. …</p>
                        <p>Wed. 26 to Sat. 29. I have been holding Court these days; but not trying any
                                    important cases. It is a very cold spell of Weather.</p>
                        <p>Mon. 31. Held Court all this day.</p>
                        <p>And here the year closes! I record the fact that, for the mercies of the Deity to me
                                    and mine in things both temporal and spiritual, I have great occasion for
                                    thankfulness. To him be all the glory! Amen!</p>

                                    would pray the Great Author of my being to help me to spend so much of this year as

                        <p>Tues. 8 Wed. 9 Th. 10. I passed these days in my law school and holding
                                    court—employed every day from 8.30 A. M. to about 4 P. M., and dining
                                    between 4 and 5. And every day I am regaining health.</p>
                        <p>Fr. 11 Sat. 12 These days I spent in my Law School and in the U.S. Court, trying a

                        <p>Mon. 14 To Sat. 19. This week I spent in my usual round of business. I closed the
                                    business of my Court for the present, adjourning over to the 31st for the
                                    accommodation of counsel; and daily with my law students.</p>
                        <p>Fr. [Feb.] 8. As usual, in my dull rounds. I have news to-day that Congress is likely
                                    to raise my salary to $4,000. I think it will be done. So mote it be!</p>
                        <p>Tu. [Mon.] 11 to Th. 14. I had my usual round in my law school these days, with
                                    nothing special occurring.</p>
                        <p>Fr. 15 Sat. 16. The time passes heavily. I am tired of my Law School, and wish it

                        <p>Mon. [25] to Th. 28. These days closed our law session. We ended on Monday night, at

                                    so I loitered away the time. One good piece of luck indeed I supose [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] I have: I suppose it is certain that Congress has raised my salary to

                        <p>Sat. [Aug.] 17. From the 16th of April last to this date, I have suffered so much
                                    from my spinal disease, and was during nearly all the time so much afflicted in my
                                    nerves, as to make it very difficult for me to write. So, during that period, I have

                                    Accordingly, I procured Judge [Samuel H.] Treat of Ill. to commence my Courts on the
                                    first Tuesday of May. He staid with us about two weeks. Then Judge Davis came and
                                    held the Court about two weeks. At the end of this time, I had so far recovered my
                                    health, as to be able to hold the Courts myself. And <list type="footnotes">

                                    $96,000. I sold out my share to Porter for $800, of which he
                                    paid me $500. to day, and is to pay the rest Oct. 1. So I am in funds

                        <p>Mon. 21 to Sat. 26. I spent the week mostly in my study investigating legal
                                    questions, and enjoy pretty fair health. O! how sweet it is after so much as I have
                                    suffered the past 18 months, to find myself clear of it; and how thankful I ought to
                                    be to the Universal Father for it.</p>
                        <p>Tues. [Nov.] 5. To day the Fall term of our U.S. Courts begins. I empannel[le]d the
                                    grand Jury called the docket for motions, and adjourned till to morrow. We have a

                        <p>Wed. 6. Not well to day. Bad symptoms.</p>
                        <p>We commenced the trial of Parker et. al. vs. Ayles-worth this after noon.</p>
                        <p>Th. 7. Spent the whole day on the trial we began yesterday. It will probably hold us
                                    all this week, if not longer.</p>
                        <p>Bad political news to day. N. Y. has in her late election gone democratic very
                                    largely. It is probable that now the U.S. are democratic.</p>
                        <p>Fr. 8 Sat. 9. Engaged as yesterday; and the prospect is that the case on trial will
                                    take a week.</p>
                        <p>Mon. 10 to Sat. 16. Spent the solid week on the trial of Parker et al. v. Aylesworth.

                        <p>Mon. 25 to Sat. 30. I spent the entire week in Court. My health is daily improving. I
                                    trust now that my spinal disease and the consequent neuralgia are gradually fading
                                    out, and that I will finally get well.</p>

                                    </placeName> et al. It is a case about a transaction between the Shakers and James

                                    1817. In this case the deposition of Mrs. Delilah Whipple, 79 years old was read.
                                    She testifies how James Price came to join the Shakers at their town near <placeName>

                                    coming up toward his heart, and requested to have the Shakers sent for. They came.
                                    His brother Benjamin being one of them. But what they or he said or did, I know not;
                                    for I was not permitted to hear any thing they said. But I know that a part of what
                                    was done on that occasion was a <hi rend="i">Shaker Dance</hi>, and James got up and
                                    joined in their dance for some time; and then professed to be well, went home with
                                    his brother Ben., and after that never cohabited with his wife. Very shortly after

                        <p>Mon. 6 to Sat. 11. I spent these days in my usual round, holding Court, preparing

                                    success would, in my opinion, be an unspeakable national calamity.</p>

                  <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>, twenty-one men gathered inside John
                    Higbee's mill on July 20, 1816. The purpose of the meeting was to consider the political
                    canvass about to take place in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>'s Second Congressional District—<placeName>

                    </placeName>, Jessamine, and Woodford counties. This meeting had received advanced publicity, and
                    outside the mill there stirred a crowd of several hundred angry citizens.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                    Inside the mill events proceeded without major drama or debate; the men resolved that "the
                    committee are deeply impressed with the importance of selecting a suitable candidate to be
                    recommended to the people for general support in opposition to Mr. Clay."<hi rend="sup">2</hi> The group, although not unanimously, then selected John Pope as the man to challenge Henry
                    Clay for his seat in the <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>When the men inside Higbee's mill chose Pope to challenge <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName>, they unwittingly set the stage for a political dialectic more comprehensive than a
                    contested seat in the House of Representatives would indicate. The summer campaign presented a
                    microcosm of a larger political struggle that characterized other state and national campaigns
                    during 1816; Pope's battle with <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> became a battle between the dying power of the Federalist party and the growing
                    monopoly of the Republican party and showed that political philosophies could be stronger than
                    personalities. Either by choice or association the two men served as spokesmen for separate
                    ideologies, one of which their constituents regarded with hostility and intolerance.</p>

                    </placeName>'s effective use of legal and political oratory prompted Justice Joseph Story
                    to write, "Clay has argued before us with a good deal of ability; and if he were not a

                    rumors that his nomination was a foregone conclusion, Pope formally disavowed any design on his part
                    to dominate or control the meeting. He said that he considered Higbee's a free forum of the
                    people; and if given an obvious mandate there, he would postpone his political retirement and
                    campaign against the Compensation Act.<hi rend="sup">31</hi>

            <p>Since Pope's nomination seemed assured, judging by the number of his active supporters who
                    were delegates, the conclave at Higbee's only served to formalize the act. One day before
                    the meeting, the <hi rend="i">Western Monitor</hi> set the tone for the anti-<placeName>

                    not wish to banish Mr. Clay <hi rend="i">forever</hi> from our public counsels, but we do think it
                    important that he should feel the indignation of an offended people."<hi rend="sup">32</hi>

            <p>Considering the hundreds of angry citizens who gathered outside Higbee's to protest the

                    delegates who could muster only seventy-five per cent of their number (15 of 21) to sanction
                    Pope's candidacy. It also pointed out that of the fifty militia districts in the three

                    speech supporting the bank. The sections which discussed the unconstitutionality of the early bank
                    received particular attention. The editors noted that Clay could change at the slightest whim; but
                    the Constitution remained constant, thus implying that Clay had taken great liberties with the

                    hoped to reactivate the opposition that had been directed against Pope in 1811.</p>
            <p>Kentuckians that year had not been very receptive to hearing Pope's reasons for voting for
                    the rechartering of the bank. Other than printing his congressional speech in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Frankfort</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Palladium</hi>, Pope had little chance to reveal his motives for defending the bank. An
                    analysis of Pope's 1811 bank speech reveals a liberal constitutional interpretation, a
                    defense of the bank as a stable institution, and a prediction that financial chaos would result if
                    banking were turned over to the states. He asserted that he had cast his vote in good conscience to

            <p>More interested in Pope's good conduct than his good conscience, Kentuckians demanded to
                    know why he had violated instruction rather than why he had supported the bank. In an open letter
                    published in the <hi rend="i">Palladium</hi> Pope explained his case. He related that not until one

                    </placeName> instructions arrive. By then he had already arranged support for the bank and could not
                    readily reverse his stand.<hi rend="sup">50</hi> With this moderate and almost conciliatory
                    explanation, Pope probably could have avoided the wrath of his constituents. He chose, however, to
                    assert his independence and ended his open letter with the statement that "I acted under a

            <p>Thanks to a new flock of War Hawks, the lower house of Congress said "war."
                    Historians disagree on the influence and membership of the War Hawk group, but most agree that
                    Clay's role in the passage of the war bill was substantial. "More than any other

                    getting the measure accepted.<hi rend="sup">58</hi>

                    reluctance to commence hostilities with Britain. Pope, in particular, played an instrumental role in
                    the Senate's two weeks of delaying action. Pope and Thomas Worthington from <placeName>

                    declaration of war on his constituents. In 1811 he had defied instructions and favored an unpopular
                    bank; in 1812 he had again defied instructions and opposed a popular war. For this, he received an
                    immediate censure by his fellow citizens. In <placeName>

                    reactivating these old issues he tapped a reservoir of existing opposition to Pope and channeled it

            <p>Pope found it nearly impossible to clear himself from these charges. Although he had worked closely
                    with <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s Republican administration on most measures, his legislative record on
                    certain issues placed him so dangerously close to the outcast Federalists that the distance between
                    membership and friendship became indistinguishable during the campaign. Perhaps the most damaging
                    example of this power of association concerned Pope's relationship to the hated Alien and
                    Sediton Acts. Pope had not been a member of the state legislature in 1798 when the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Resolutions were passed to condemn these Federalist laws; he had taken a seat the

                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> Resolutions passed, strengthening the original resolutions with a vague threat of
                        nullification.<hi rend="sup">71</hi> Pope voted against these second resolutions to his later
                    regret; for as one historian observed, "If <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> ever had political gods, those same resolutions may be thus classed."<hi rend="sup">72</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a seemingly desperate attempt to divorce himself from the Alien and Sedition Acts, Pope issued a
                    series of explanatory broadsides during the final week of the 1816 campaign. In them he declared,
                    "I do most positively deny that I ever defended those laws." He stated that he had
                    voted against the Second <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> Resolutions only because he did not approve of the nullification remedy that would have
                    allowed <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> to invalidate any obnoxious federal measures. If the single nullification clause had
                    been deleted, he would have been willing to support the rest of the resolution.<hi rend="sup">73</hi> But, the lingering implication of his vote pictured him as an advocate of the
                    Federalist-sponsored Alien and Sediton Acts. Those voters who were old enough to remember
                    Pope's stand in 1799 were old enough to remember <placeName>

                    of campaigning. Among the flurry of last minute polemics, one Pope supporter published a broadside

                    for it tomorrow—He may put his hand into your public Treasury and carry off your money
                    contrary to the Constitution. Still he is Republican."<hi rend="sup">75</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Both candidates, vowing that they were Republicans, agreed to meet for a public debate on July 31
                    outside Higbee's mill. This mill, which seemed to be a favorite assembly area for the
                    three-county district, played host to the only formal confrontation of the opponents. While the
                    controversial Higbee's Convention had received full newspaper coverage and is mentioned in
                    private correspondence, the supposedly climactic Higbee's debate received little or no
                    coverage. A probable explanation for this lapse in contemporary accounts is that the newspapers
                    appearing the following week carried the election returns; hence, the editors chose not to report
                    the final stages of campaigning when the votes had already been tabulated.</p>
            <p>Only one extensive account of the debate seems to have been recorded and that appeared fifteen years
                    after the event. George D. Prentice, a twenty-eight year old journalist, came to <placeName>

                    </placeName>, and briefly researched his subject before publishing the biography the following

                    </placeName> and maintained a dramatic tone that approached almost total romanticism. Prentice
                    reconstructed the Higbee debate as a battle of giants limited to thirty minutes of verbal jousting.

            <p>The 1816 elections carried a new wave of Republicans into the so-called Era of Good Feelings in which
                    Federalism remained either dormant or dying. Rufus King, the unsuccessful presidential aspirant, was
                    the last candidate to campaign for the White House on a Federalist ticket; and in several states,
                    former Federalists conducted gubernatorial campaigns as new Republicans. Neither in state
                    legislatures nor in the national Congress could Federalists command a position of power, their poor

            <p>The present teacher of Indiana history has a more substantial body of classroom materials at his
                    disposal than ever before. While some items have a nominal price, many are free; and in no case
                    should cost constitute a serious barrier. The discriminating use of these materials should
                    contribute to more effective teaching and a richer learning experience for the student. In 1966 the
                    Indiana Historical Bureau (140 North Senate Avenue, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> 46204), the state's historical agency, will distribute approximately half a
                    million pieces of such material. In most instances the Bureau provides materials to teachers in
                    classroom lots without charge other than a refund of postage; however, responses cannot be made to
                    requests from individual students.</p>
            <p>For the elementary student the Bureau has a series of fourth grade leaflets entitled: <hi rend="i">The First People in Indiana, The French in Indiana, Pioneer Living in Indiana, Travel in
                        Indiana Long Ago</hi>, and <hi rend="i">Good Times of Young Pioneers</hi> (four pages each,
                    illustrated). Leaflets concerning the emblems of Indiana, the state seal, bird, tree, flower, flag,
                    and motto (four color printing), are also available.</p>
            <p>The Bureau also has a number of items for the junior high student. These include: <hi rend="i">George
                        Rogers Clark, Chief Little Turtle</hi>, and <hi rend="i">William Henry Harrison</hi> (six pages
                    each, illustrated); the <hi rend="i">Frontier Rifle</hi> and the <hi rend="i">Conestoga Wagon</hi>
                    (four pages each, illustrated); <hi rend="i">The Whitewater Canal</hi> by Harry O. Garman (12 pages,
                    map); <hi rend="i">Indians of Indiana</hi> by Erminie Wheeler-Voegelin (six pages); and <hi rend="i">The Word "Hoosier"</hi> by Hubert H. Hawkins (three pages, illustrated). <hi rend="i">A Brief History of Indiana</hi> by Donald F. Carmony (64 pages), now in its sixth
                    edition, is a most useful basic booklet. The Bureau has also published <hi rend="i">Readings in
                        Indiana History</hi> by Gayle Thornbrough and Dorothy Riker (1956, 625 pages, cloth-bound,

                    are suitable for stronger junior high students and may be procured from the Bureau.</p>
            <p>The Indiana Sesquicentennial Commission has begun a series of booklets relating to Indiana history.
                    Three titles are now obtainable from the Commission (101 State Office Building, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

                    William L. Madigan (74 pages). A few additional booklets, intended mainly for use by junior high
                    students, are anticipated before the series is completed.</p>
            <p>Two valuable sets of filmstrips concerning Indiana history have recently become available. During
                    1965 the Indiana Sesquicentennial Commission distributed a set of twelve filmstrips, covering
                    Indiana history from the early Indian background to the present, which were produced by Richard H.
                    Caldemeyer and Byron P. Shurtleff of Ball State University, <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>, <country reg="inu">Indiana</country>
               </placeName>. These filmstrips
                    were presented to school units having junior high level classes, both public and private, and also
                    to public libraries. Partly in color and partly in black and white, they are principally intended
                    for use at the junior high level, but they can be adapted to use in elementary classes. Early in
                    1966 the Jam Handy Organization <pb n="253" id="VAA4025-062-3-083"/> (2821 East Grand Boulevard,
                            <placeName>

               </placeName> 48211) completed a set of six filmstrips concerning Indiana
                    history. These filmstrips, all in color, are chiefly intended for fourth and fifth grades, but they
                    may be adapted for junior high students. The Indiana Historical Society still has a limited number
                    of Civil War filmstrips in black and white available for sale. These titles are: <hi rend="i">Indiana in the Civil War, The Home Front</hi> and <hi rend="i">Indiana in the Civil War, The
                        Soldier in the Field</hi> ($5.00 per set).</p>
            <p>Many useful publications are particularly helpful to teachers in their continued study of Indiana
                    history. The <hi rend="i">Indiana Historical Collections</hi> (44 volumes), published by the Bureau;
                    the <hi rend="i">Indiana Historical Society Publications</hi> (22 volumes), issued by the Society;
                    the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> (61 volumes), published by the history department
                    of Indiana University; and the <hi rend="i">Indiana History Bulletin</hi> (42 volumes), published by
                    the Bureau, are rich resources. All four of these publications are continuing series, and the last
                    three of them are automatically available to members of the Indiana Historical Society. In 1965 Emma
                    Lou Thornbrough's <hi rend="i">Indiana in the Civil War Era, 1850–1880</hi>, as
                    Volume III of the Indiana Sesquicentennial History being prepared jointly by the Society and the
                    Bureau, was published. Four additional volumes are expected during the next few years, all of them
                    available without charge to members of the Indiana Historical Society.</p>
            <p>Additional items may be obtained from other sources such as the Department of Commerce and Public
                    Relations and the Department of Natural Resources. <hi rend="i">Outdoor Indiana</hi>, formerly a
                    publication of the Department of Natural Resources, contained many interesting history articles. The
                        <hi rend="i">Indiana Teacher</hi> has at times included informative history materials. Many
                    local historical societies have issued items of value as have chambers of commerce and business
                    firms.</p>
            <p>Teachers of Indiana history and school librarians are well advised to become collectors of relevant
                    pamphlets, pictures, maps, and books. Such collections have a continuing use. Teachers and
                    librarians are cordially invited to base their collections on materials received through membership
                    in the Indiana Historical Society.</p>
            <pb n="254" id="VAA4025-062-3-084"/>
            <p>Teachers should also utilize other, non-printed resources. In every community there are knowledgeable
                    persons well versed in local history. Short talks by such persons can add enrichment and variety to
                    normal classroom instruction. Guest lecturers can often be procurred through the local historical
                    society. Almost every school is within convenient distance of a significant site, structure,
                    memorial, or museum. Occasional field trips to such points will add excitement and interest to
                    classroom instruction. With proper advance preparation visits to local museums or to the homes of
                    early Hoosiers, such as Benjamin Harrison, James F. D. Lanier, and Thomas Marshall, can become
                    meaningful learning experiences.</p>

            <p>
               <hi rend="i">George Rapp's Harmony Society</hi> is a fascinating narrative of a people whose
                    determination to succeed found no obstacle on the American frontier impossible to conquer. At an
                    early age in <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> their leader assembled schoolmates and persuaded them to do his chores while he climbed
                    a tree to edify them with his preaching. While Rapp's deep religious feeling revealed
                    itself by participation in private gatherings, his interest in these meetings was of short duration.
                    Moreover, since the formality of the established church service failed to satisfy his desire for
                    communion with Christ, he withdrew from it. Accordingly he expressed his views to friends and
                    rapidly attracted followers, who were referred to as Separatists.</p>
            <p>As their movement gained momentum, the authorities regarded the Separatists as a serious threat and
                    danger to the state. "I am a prophet and am called to be one" (p. 30), declared
                    George Rapp in June, 1791, when an official at Maulbronn, Württemberg, investigated his
                    activities and ordered him to be silent. After repeated investigations and warnings, the society in
                    1803 sent Rapp and several other members to America to locate a region where they might live in
                    peace. Land was acquired on the <geogName>Connoquenessing River</geogName> in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName> County, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, and on July 4, 1804, the first group arrived to be followed by two more groups in
                    September. On February 15, 1805, the legal organization of the Harmony Society was established. Even
                    in the land of promise, they soon discovered the outside world was interferring in their affairs.
                    This brought back vivid memories of similar experiences in Württemberg. Then, too, the
                    increasing population and rising prices of land in their neighborhood did not deepen their love for
                    the region.</p>
            <p>Consequently, in April, 1814, Rapp and two Harmonists set out again to seek a new location. In May,
                    Rapp wrote from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> that they had found the best land along the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>. He was further impressed by the size of the river and the fact that it provided
                    year-round navigation to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Hence, on June 20, 1814, a company of Harmonists on flatboats started for their new
                    home in Indiana. Although they engaged in agriculture, manufacturing, and commerce with much
                    success, they also promoted learning. Many of the members brought their libraries from <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>, and books were continuously bought to add to the society's library.
                    Practically every field of human knowledge was represented in its extensive collection. Inasmuch as
                    the society kept up with new developments in science, physicians from other localities came to
                    consult their recent medical works. Great friends of literature, philosophy, and theology, they also
                    expressed themselves well in prose and verse as is evidenced by manuscripts in their archives. The
                    author, however, is somewhat in error when he states, "The <pb n="256" id="VAA4025-062-3-086"/> Society's expenditure on books was then greater than the
                    appropriation of the state of Indiana for its State Library" (p. 253). The Indiana State
                    Library was not established until 1825 and then only as a department of the office of the secretary
                    of state. It did not become a separate institution until 1841.</p>
            <p>Later in the Indiana period the society acquired a printing press. On it were printed programs of the
                    society, maps, hymnals, textbooks, and most important of all, Indiana's first philosophy
                    book in 1824. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> may truly be referred to as the cultural oasis of the Hoosier State during that period.</p>
            <p>Oddly enough, after ten years on the banks of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>, the Harmonists were again possessed with the "Wanderlust." Because
                    of their increased interest in manufacturing, they desired a more advantageous location. Moreover,
                    the external discomforts of poor mail facilities, poor communication with the East, unpleasant
                    relations with neighbors, currency troubles, and miscarriage of justice reinforced the basically
                    religious cause for a third move. They returned to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> as conditions there were more favorable to their work and interests. German was not a
                    foreign language in that state, nor were German speaking legislators considered alien.</p>
            <p>The final agreement with Robert Owen for the sale of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> was not consummated until January 3, 1825. Although the last group of Rappites did not
                    leave until May 5, 1825, the Owenites began to take up residence before that date.</p>
            <p>The third home at Economy on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> also had its problems. Unfortunately, the visit of Count Leon, Archduke Maximilian of
                    the Stem of Judah and Root of David, caused a schism in the society that never completely healed. In
                    spite of the difficulties, which included finances, caused by his visit, the Harmony Society was as
                    firm and sound as a rock during the Panic of 1837.</p>
            <p>"The legal entity which came into being in 1805 was not buried with Rapp; in fact its legal
                    existence began to flourish after his death and legally was not put to rest until the lawyers spoke
                    their last words in 1916" (p. 581).</p>

            <p>This is a little book about three big men who were interpreters of the American frontier. Within
                    these few pages in large print historians Jacobs, Caughey, and Frantz appraise Frederick Jackson
                    Turner, Herbert Eugene Bolton, and Walter Prescott Webb. Although all three subjects of this book
                    are now dead, evaluations did not in each instance await their passing; and each had demonstrated
                    within his lifetime that the road of the generalizer is rough, hilly, and unstable.</p>
            <p>Even though a touch of the poet has been ascribed to Turner and even though his classic essay,

                    great difficulties committing his ideas to print. "The fact is," writes Jacobs,
                    "that Turner was a writer by virtue of necessity"—a fact emphatically
                    underscored by Ray A. Billington in his <geogName>Mississippi Valley</geogName> Historical
                    Association presidential address, "Why Some Historians Rarely Write History." But
                    Turner—on or off the printed page—was a man of original ideas, and in the
                    words alloted to him Jacobs has managed to allude to some of these. For example, he has discussed
                    Turner's concept of westward expansion as a process rather than as a fixed zone, his ideas
                    on sectionalism, and his reaching out for and grasping of the broad interrelationships within the
                    American story. Jacobs also manages to portray Turner's modest yet exacting nature as well
                    as his deep devotion to and reliance upon his students.</p>
            <p>Caughey, first of all, succeeds admirably in recapturing a glimpse of Bolton in his mid-fifties when
                    this remarkably productive Latin American historian simultaneously chaired the University of <placeName>

                    </placeName> history department, headed the Bancroft Library, taught classes with fantastically
                    large undergraduate enrollments, directed the dissertations of scores of graduate students, and
                    produced books and articles in assembly-line fashion. Caughey, who was one of Bolton's
                    students, has not only succeeded in producing a vivid portrait of his mentor but has also managed to
                    describe Bolton's tremendous physical endurance, boundless enthusiasm, unrestrained
                    optimism, and great desire not only to unveil new areas of history but also to relate the common
                    history of the Americas.</p>
            <p>Frantz sees Webb as falling somewhat between his two distinguished contemporaries. This <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName> historian was basically a theorist. His writings were compressed between rather
                    protracted periods of cogitation. He was a western historian; but his view of the West, as in the
                    case of his book <hi rend="i">The Great Frontier</hi>, was set on a world-wide stage.
                    Webb's works were severely attacked during his lifetime, but his <hi rend="i">The Great
                        Plains</hi> is more likely to stand the test of time than are the theoretical writings of either
                    of the two historians discussed in this little book. Not only do Jacobs, Caughey, and Frantz succeed
                    in portraying interesting facets of their respective subjects, but they unwittingly reveal much of
                    themselves as well.</p>

            <p>This book, edited by Carl S. Meyer, director of graduate studies, Concordia Seminary, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, is a collection of readings in the history of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> Synod Lutheran Church. This church body began in consequence of German immigration of
                    the 1830's and 1840's and was founded in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1847 as the Evangelical Lutheran Synod of <placeName>

               </placeName>, and Other
                    States. The Synod presently has some two <pb n="258" id="VAA4025-062-3-088"/> hundred congregations
                    in an Indiana District which also takes in a part of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. The readings therefore reflect a part of Indiana's religious heritage.</p>
            <p>In the Preface the editor states the purpose of the collection: "The work has a twofold aim.
                    First, it is to serve students in Lutheran theological seminaries and teachers' colleges as
                    a resource work for courses in historical theology. Second, it is to help professional men and
                    women, as well as other interested students of church history, further their interest in and
                    acquaintance with a significant church body" (p. vii). Later in the Preface Editor Meyer
                    notes: "Public libraries, the libraries of universities and colleges, and the libraries of
                    professional men outside the Lutheran church, it is hoped, will find the present volume of value for
                    their readers" (p. ix).</p>
            <p>Indiana readers will find a number of items of special interest in the collection. A pioneer Lutheran
                    missionary, Friedrich Conrad Dietrich Wyneken, (1810–1876) roamed the prairies of
                    northern Indiana from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Michigan City</settlement>
                    </placeName> to Niles, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>, in the north and to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crawfordsville</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the south between 1828 and 1841. This Lutheran "Francis Asbury"
                    founded a number of congregations in northeastern Indiana which became charter members of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> Synod. His famous tract, "Die Noth der deutschen Lutheraner in
                    Nordamerika," ("The Distress of the German Lutherans in North America") is included in
                    Chapter III.</p>
            <p>Other pertinent selections deal with the "Beginnings of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> Seminary" (1846), "The Status of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> Seminary" (1852), and "The <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> Seminary in 1856" (pp. 216–17). The <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Seminary curriculum in 1860 is also outlined and reflects the pattern of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> Synod ministerial training in the nineteenth century.</p>
            <p>With regard to the title Carl Meyer writes "The frontier theme, it is true, can be
                    overemphasized in looking at the history of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> Synod. No adaptation of Turner's thesis will make for an adequate
                    interpretation of that history. Other moving forces, theological and ecclesiological, entered
                    in" (p. vii). The selected bibliography will be helpful to anyone interested in doing
                    further research into Lutheran Church history. The maps, too, are most useful as are the listings of
                    pastors and parishes of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> and Canadian-American relations, the reader awaited the appearance of this book. He had
                    hoped that it would fill some gaps in the understanding of the intricate relationship between the <placeName>

                    </placeName> frontier and the rise of the <geogName>Red River</geogName> settlement toward

                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>. Both hopes are amply realized.</p>
            <p>Gluek's study treats virtually all aspects of the interrelationship suggested by its title,
                    and it is a book of considerable merit. Much already is known about <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName>'s expansionism, the Reciprocity Treaty of 1854, the Sioux uprising, and the
                    Kiel Rebellion; but until now the information has been scattered in journal articles and individual
                    chapters of books in which the chief focus lay elsewhere. Indeed, much of our previous knowledge
                    stems from Gluek's own studies which have appeared in the <hi rend="i">Canadian Historical
                        Review, <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                        </placeName> History</hi>, and <hi rend="i">Beaver</hi>; and anyone who has followed the
                    author's careful traverse of this terrain within the journals will find his book not as new
                    as one might have hoped.</p>
            <p>If already well-known in outline, the story Gluek tells here in his quiet, controlled prose is now
                    enriched by detail and elaborated by more formal and lengthy analysis. Essentially a narrative
                    history, the present book nonetheless has much to say both by implication and by specific argument
                    about the larger problems of the Canadian-American relationship. The <geogName>Red River</geogName>
                    area was a region in which the economy, communications, and nomadic populations were one. How, then,
                    did Britain, and British North America (and after 1867, <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>) hold to that portion centering upon Winnipeg? The answer is to be found in political
                    and individual analyses; and it is in his investigation of the activities of such figures as Norman
                    W. Kittson, James Wickes Taylor, John Schultz, William McDougall, and of course, Sir John A.
                    Macdonald, together with two careful chapters on the politics and economics of "<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName>'s Territorial Years" and "<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName>'s Post-War Expansionism," that Gluek makes his most important
                    contribution.</p>
            <p>In one respect, however, the book is disappointing. It is quite devoid of scholarly apparatus, aside
                    from footnotes: there is no essay on manuscript sources, no bibliography, and no very full
                    indication as to where research was conducted. Consequently, the reader must root through the
                    footnotes to learn locations of crucial collections of papers, and he can form no clear impression
                    concerning the substructure of monographic literature upon which the book is based. All of the
                    manuscript collections (i.e., the Taylor Papers, the Sibley Papers, etc.) are well known to
                    specialists in the field, but some readers will be approaching this subject for the first time. One
                    may presume that Gluek has read J. J. Hargrave's <hi rend="i">
                        <geogName>Red River</geogName>
                    </hi> or Joseph Lehmann's biography of Sir Garnet Wolseley or the several relevant
                    unpublished doctoral dissertations and master's theses (one on Schultz), but one cannot be
                    certain from the notes.</p>
            <p>One man's footnote is another man's pedantry, of course; and no two authors will
                    agree on what constitutes adequate evidence for any given generalization. But scholars who work in
                    the field of Canadian-American studies face a particular problem which forces upon them somewhat
                    denser documentation than in other fields: they are writing for two often quite distinct audiences.
                    All Canadian historians will know of W. L. Morton's fine history of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mbc">Manitoba</region>
                    </placeName>, but many American readers will not. Failure to mention the work would be a disservice
                    to <pb n="260" id="VAA4025-062-3-090"/> readers south of the border. Conversely, all American
                    historians will know Weinberg's theoretical study of the topology of <hi rend="i">Manifest
                        Destiny</hi>, but many Canadians will not. Thus attention should be directed to it, if not in
                    the text then in a note. In short, Gluek has written an excellent history, but by too ruthlessly
                    pruning his documentation he has made it less useful for students than some readers might have
                    wished. It would be graceless, however, to leave the impression that the integrity or value for
                    specialists to be found in this precise study is in any way vitiated: it is a work of high merit,
                    deserving of what it will receive, a long and useful life.</p>

            <p>Perhaps the thing that first impresses the reader of these sketches is the contrast in the lives of
                    the people discussed. They ranged from the Reverend Belknap of modest means to Henry E. Huntington
                    of fabulous fortune; from the almost bedfast invalid Ann Cunningham to the wide-ranging world
                    traveler Edgar Lee Hewitt; from J. Franklin Jameson, trained promoter of historical scholarship, to
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> matron, Mrs. Landauer. At the same time the reader is aware that there are certain
                    characteristics that they all held in common—a steadiness of purpose, an unflagging zeal
                    and drive toward their goals, high standards, and an unwillingness ever to let go. The editor,
                    Clifford Lord, points out that in their lines of greatest endeavor and success they were all
                    amateurs as opposed to the professional historians of today. In the light of this comment, it seems
                    that the present-day "Keepers of the Past," both professional and nonprofessional,
                    might well refresh themselves in reflecting on these pioneers—their dedication, their
                    devotion and enthusiasm, their high standards, and the continuing effects of their accomplishments
                    in the broad field of historical preservation.</p>
            <p>The sketches are short, generally well-written, and lively, forming a little volume well worth
                    reading by both amateur and professional historians.</p>

            <p>One of the generalizations about recent American history which is often heard but seldom documented
                    is that, since Populist days, farming has become less a way of life and more a commercial
                    enterprise. Old-time protest, <hi rend="i">a la</hi> the early Grange, the Farmers'
                    Alliances, and the People's party, is said to have given way to a more pragmatic search for
                    profits; and some have even suggested that the farmer has changed from the archetypal American
                    individualist to a partner with, if not a ward of, the government. These are provocative
                    overstatements, but there is no denying that major changes have taken place. The Allianceman of
                    1890, and even the Non-Partisan Leaguer of a quarter-century later, was a very different man from
                    the agribusiness-man of today, especially with regard to his attitudes toward, and commercial
                    connections with, the larger economy. The greatest value of Professor Fite's book is that
                    he has demonstrated clearly, concretely, and deftly how changes like these took place in a major
                    instance. His <pb n="262" id="VAA4025-062-3-092"/> history of the Consumers Cooperative Association,
                    from tiny beginnings in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kansas City</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1929 to quarter-billion-dollar vastness today, can be considered a case study in the
                    transformation of midwestern American agriculture. As such it is a significant work for all students
                    of recent American history; and because it is organized and presented so ably, it is a satisfying
                    work as well.</p>
            <p>Those interested in the historical development of agricultural economics will find it useful,
                    particularly for its treatment of materials distribution, product marketing, and the spread of
                    mechanization, scientific methods, and sectoral interdependence: what C.C.A. sold best were what
                    modern farmers seemed to need most. Business history the book certainly is, and of a kind of
                    business with which historians have not often dealt. Because of the central position in the
                    association of its chief founder and long-time president, Howard A. Cowden, the book is a study in
                    business leadership. It also explains—and on balance, underscores—the
                    importance of government in modern agriculture: the role of government being usually positive in the
                    case of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> (particularly as a supplier of otherwise unavailable investment capital through its
                    Banks for Cooperatives, and incidentally as a shaper of company organization through its lending
                    requirements); and usually negative in the case of the states (especially in the form of harassment
                    attempts and special-interest opposition expressed through certain <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> officials).</p>
            <p>The book also says something about American farmers. Largely unmoved by cooperative commonwealths or
                    similar visions, farmers responded very sensitively to the marginal cost reductions presented them
                    by the C.C.A. This was particularly true during the 1930's, the decade during which the
                    association established itself firmly. The C.C.A. was most successful in supplying farmers, at lower
                    costs, such latter-day essentials as petroleum products and fertilizers; and it was much less
                    successful with consumer items such as groceries and building supplies. Though farmers bought far
                    more gas and oil from the association than they did philosophy, a residual asset (played on
                    skilfully though sincerely by association leaders) was nevertheless the farmers'
                    antimonopoly and anti-eastern sentiment.</p>
            <p>There are a few questions with which the book does not deal, such as the position of the C.C.A.
                    within the cooperative movement; the reasons for its great growth relative to other suppliers, aside
                    from shrewd management; details on the relations of the C.C.A. with local cooperatives, and of the
                    locals with their customers; and the characteristics, in terms of location, income, and product, of
                    its ultimate users. But these are outside of its intended scope. What Professor Fite did choose to
                    discuss, and it is a great deal, he made sense of admirably. With full and unrestricted access to
                    the files of the C.C.A., together with other primary sources, the author has written a readable and
                    significant volume, explicit where it could so easily have been blurred, that should last a good
                    long time.</p>

                    </placeName> were driven by the anguish and desperation of depression to a series of spontaneous
                    violent outbursts. Professor Shover calls this the most aggressive agrarian uprising of the century.
                    With rather less continuity than the author suggests, the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName> "Cow War" in the spring of 1931 was followed in August, 1932, by the
                    first Farmers' Holiday Association crop withholding action in that area where
                            <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName> come together. Early 1933 saw a widespread wave of anti-foreclosure demonstrations and
                    penny auctions until martial law was declared in the critical <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName> counties. In the meantime, a <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> milk strike produced further disorders. At the end of 1933 a halfhearted second Holiday
                    Association strike terminated the agrarian violence.</p>
            <p>All together these events make a dramatic episode in American history. Shover has provided a
                    thoroughgoing and straightforward account of these disorders and has exploited their stirring human
                    interest while maintaining scholarly detachment. He succeeds admirably in weaving together the
                    several disjointed movements and sorting out the bewildering proliferation of organizations. The
                    author was tireless in searching for the documentation, and he steeped himself in the locale and the
                    testimony of survivors. A notable by-product is a detailed examination of the largely unsuccessful
                    attempt of the Communist party to use the agrarian unrest for its own purposes.</p>
            <p>The significance of these events is still an open question. They illustrate the severity of the
                    depression better than statistics of hog prices at three and four dollars a hundredweight and milk
                    at two cents a quart. Frantic rural folk who could see no relief ahead assembled to barricade the
                    roads and dump milk. The active supporters of the movement, however, were only a very small
                    proportion of the farmers, and this surely did not make a regional rebellion. The resort to ugly
                    lawlessness created a national fright at the time. This speeded the application of price support
                    programs but seems not to have had much influence upon national legislation and policy.</p>
            <p>Unavoidably, perhaps, the author gives much attention to the noisy Milo Reno and his
                    Farmers' Holiday Association. The association never had a membership as large as ten
                    thousand, and it is not clear whether Reno was leading or following the farmers. This much is clear:
                    the association and its leaders were more damaging than helpful to farmers. Irrational and
                    irresponsible, the organization dwindled away to become the personal property of a few cranky
                    officers who tried to deliver the remnants to the Huey Long and Coughlin crowd in 1935.</p>

            <p>Wallace <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName> offers in <hi rend="i">The King's Friends</hi> an impressive analysis of the
                    nearly three thousand Loyalist claimants who sought indemnity for the losses incurred during the
                    American Revolution from the British claims commission. The question which immediately arises is
                    that of how typical this group, numbering between eight and nine per cent of the exiles, was of the
                    entire body of Loyalists in the colonies. The author makes it clear that his study deals with a
                    small percentage of the Loyalists, but he rightfully suggests that many of his findings might very
                    well apply to the whole group. The claimants are a substantial sampling, and the fact that they
                    ranged so widely in social and economic status and geographical distribution would further support
                    the view that this is a representative cross-section of the Loyalists.</p>
            <p>The more Loyalism is studied the more apparent it becomes that it was largely a personal matter
                    influenced by local conditions. Thus <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName> minutely examines the make-up of the claimants in each colony according to a variety of
                    categories: number, national origin, occupation, social status, geographical distribution, religious
                    affiliation, size of claim, service to the British, treatment by the provincial government, and
                    finally, motivation. While this method tends to be repetitious in content, cumbersome in style, and
                    statistical rather than interpretive, it does answer some significant questions about the
                    composition of the Tory element and makes possible comparisons among the colonies.</p>
            <p>The weakest portion of the study is the author's interpretation of the motives of the
                    Loyalists, and it appears to be his statistical approach which hinders his evaluation. Figures
                    become more important than ideas. Only occasionally does he make reference to the political and
                    social theories and views of the individuals who chose to remain loyal despite persecution, social
                    ostracism, or loss of position and property. Brown has failed to tackle the question of ideology as
                    a factor promoting Loyalism.</p>
            <p>Some of the long standing assumptions about Loyalist groups need reconsideration, and <hi rend="i">The King's Friends</hi> makes some important contributions to our knowledge and
                    understanding of the nature of Loyalism. That allegiance to Britain was a personal matter is clear.
                    Each colony offers its own pattern, and one cannot generalize from one area to another. As to
                    numbers, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName> concludes on the basis of his sample and contemporary figures that the total body of
                    Loyalists—those who remained as well as those who left—was perhaps 160,000 as
                    a low estimate, and 384,000 as an extremely high one. Another point well made is that British
                    ineptness and ineffectiveness in encouraging and aiding would-be Loyalists led to defections and
                    neutralism, as in the case of <placeName>

                    of "modest means," thus strongly suggesting that the <pb n="265" id="VAA4025-062-3-095"/> economic factor was an insignificant one. Likewise church membership
                    was not a key to Loyalist affiliation. Even among the Anglicans, the majority were not loyal to the
                    Crown; and the author emphasizes this by pointing out that more signers of the Declaration of
                    Independence were of the Anglican faith than any other religious group.</p>
            <p>Despite the book's weakness in interpretation and presentation and in its over-reliance on
                    the reports of the claims commission, it is nonetheless a significant work. It brings together an
                    overwhelming amount of information about the claimants and becomes an indispensable handbook for an
                    analysis of the Loyalists in any one of the colonies. This study contains the raw materials for
                    further studies on this important topic.</p>

            <p>The recrudescence of conservatism on college campuses seemingly has renewed scholarly interest in
                    conservatism in the American past. Significantly, the publication of Norman K. Risjord's,
                        <hi rend="i">The Old Republicans: Southern Conservatism in the Age of Jefferson</hi> occurred
                    within weeks of the appearance of a related work, David Hackett Fischer's, <hi rend="i">Revolution of American Conservatism</hi>, a study of the Federalist party in the era of
                    Jeffersonian Democracy.</p>
            <p>Risjord traces the evolution of conservative tactics by southern Republicans who adhered to basic
                    Jeffersonian ideals: a severely restricted central government and economic simplicity. These
                    concepts stated by Jefferson during the crisis of 1798, but not followed by Jeffersonians in office,
                    led to the creation of a dissident faction within the party, the Old Republicans. Another group,
                    with which Risjord treats, is the Quids—slight in influence, small in numbers, but ably
                    led by the talented and biting eccentric, John Randolph. The author correctly keeps these two
                    factions separate and performs a valuable task in his resurrection of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Randolph</settlement>
                    </placeName> from the unflattering treatment he has received at the hands of historians.</p>
            <p>The Old Republicans loyal to the spirit of '98 were severely tested by their abortive revolt
                    during the election of 1808. Chastened by defeat, many conservatives abandoned the opposition, only
                    to balk at the aggressive War Hawk program which called for a national bank, a protective tariff,
                    internal improvements, and an enlarged regular army. During the War of 1812 the Old Republicans
                    faithfully supported the government, but with the signing of the peace treaty they renewed their
                    attack upon the new nationalism. Much weakened by failure, the Old Republicans were laid to rest by
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> debates. Some became Crawford "Radicals"; most eventually became
                    Jackson men. The remnant conservative movement was swallowed up by the extreme sectionalists from
                    the Deep South. To Risjord, the Old Republicans had served as the "missing link in the
                    conservative tradition between the Anti-federalists of 1788 and the states' rights
                    Southerners of the Jacksonian era" (p. 1).</p>
            <pb n="266" id="VAA4025-062-3-096"/>
            <p>Despite the merits of this well-written and extensively researched volume Risjord's work has
                    many shortcomings. Particularly damaging is the emphasis he has placed upon events at the national
                    level, while generally ignoring the interrelated local political struggles. Never does he manage to
                    give any indication of the appeal of the Old Republicans within the states, nor does he correlate
                    conservative views with vital local issues—over which most of the major battles of the
                    day were fought. Risjord also underplays the effect of the boom and bust period from
                    1815–1819 upon the development of the conservative mind. The emergence of an
                    interregional market economy greatly altered American attitudes towards the national government. And
                    with the Panic of 1819, many new nationalists retrenched and became poorer but wiser Jeffersonians.</p>
            <p>An interesting assertion which Risjord makes, but does not adequately document, is that many
                    southerners opposed internal improvements because they feared that the same central authority might
                    be used against the institution of slavery. He likewise does not justify the extreme emphasis he
                    places upon the War of 1812 in creating the postwar nationalism, while he neglects to discuss the
                    equally important issue of local banking and finance. Finally, he falls into established myth by
                    pointing to the existence of a monolithic southern sectional viewpoint opposed to nationalistic
                    legislation—a situation which never existed. These are admittedly strong objections to an
                    otherwise valuable book which ably discusses the ideas and practices of the Old Republicans.</p>

            <p>Zebulon Baird Vance emerged as a Whig party spokesman and champion of unionism in the turbulent
                    decade that preceded the secession crisis and the outbreak of the Civil War. Contrary to the widely
                    recognized thesis of Roy F. Nichols and others on the calibre of political leaders, the author of
                    this biography maintains that the events which occasioned the disruption of the Union brought forth
                    political giants: "In this era of stress, most states endeavored to send [to Congress]
                    their ablest and best" (p. 83). As a political aspirant from the mountains of western <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName>, Vance reflected the viewpoint of the yeoman farmer class from which he was descended.
                    His modest upbringing was enriched by voracious reading from an ample private library, and his
                    intellect was sharpened by a brief enrollment at the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName>. Zeb's extraordinary talent as an orator and his dynamic, engaging, and
                    colorful personality assured his success in politics.</p>
            <p>Vance's appeals to unionism and nationalism ended abruptly with President Lincoln's
                    call for troops in 1861. The indomitable mountaineer <pb n="267" id="VAA4025-062-3-097"/> promptly
                    enlisted as a Confederate private and, as a testimonial to his popularity, was soon elected by the
                    troops as colonel of the 26th <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName> Regiment. His military experience in the futile defense of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Bern</settlement>
                    </placeName> and in the costly Battle of Malvern Hill was limited and would not seem to warrant the
                    inordinate amount of space allotted by the author to the campaigns and leaders of the Civil War.
                    Tucker is obviously following his penchant for military history, although much of what he relates is
                    rambling, irrelevant, anecdotal, and poorly organized.</p>
            <p>It is the author's main contention that Vance as wartime governor of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName>, elected from the military ranks as a Conservative party candidate in 1862, ably
                    supported the cause of the Confederacy while he upheld the rights of his own state from encroachment
                    by an arbitrary and capricious Confederate leadership. This viewpoint is not original, but it is
                    persuasively argued in this biography. Vance is portrayed as an effective administrator whose record
                    in recruiting troops, procuring supplies, running the Union blockade, and upholding the writ of
                    habeas corpus for his fellow North Carolinians evidenced extraordinary qualities of leadership and
                    an abiding belief in individual freedom. The author contends that Vance's squabbling with
                    Jefferson Davis and the Confederate government did not stand in the way of service to the lost
                    cause. Impressive data is adduced to support this point of view. Tucker apparently injects his own
                    views and philosophy about the "continual dimunition" of the individual and the
                    expansion of governmental powers.</p>
            <p>The information on the post-Civil War period until Vance's death in 1894 is sketchy and
                    anticlimactic. The author demonstrates little knowledge about the recent historical literature on
                    the Reconstruction Era in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName>. There is practically nothing of substance on state or national politics from 1876 to
                    1894. It is ironic that Vance, who is heralded as a champion of personal liberty, would steadfastly
                    lead his party in its campaign to secure the enactment of county government laws, voting
                    requirements, and registration procedures that effectively denied local self-government and home
                    rule in his own state. The use of gerrymandering tactics left no qualms with this
                    post-Reconstruction governor and <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> senator.</p>
            <p>This is a biography written for popular consumption. It is spirited and dramatic and abounds with
                    anecdotal lore. It is far from definitive. The monumental research of Frontis W. Johnston as editor
                    of the Vance papers—of which the first volume has appeared—must be cited as a
                    more authorative source on this subject. As a reputed authority on western <placeName>

            <p>The Civil War Centennial has passed and the Federal Union has survived, just as it survived the event
                    commemorated. In each case it was at times a fairly close call. Throughout the centennial period,
                    reasonable men disagreed about the wisdom of the observance. Some of this disagreement was on public
                    policy grounds. There was, for example, an unfortunate coincidence of the Centennial and the civil
                    rights crises. Whatever may ultimately be concluded in this respect, the Centennial did support a
                    large quantity of literature, much of which might not otherwise have been published. As a whole this
                    body of publications has an uneven quality. Surely a number of exceptional books have appeared in
                    the last few years, but the fact that a number of mediocre and bad books were joined with these must
                    also be admitted. The unresolved question is whether, in spite of the inferior books, the appearance
                    of the worthwhile books justified the Centennial in terms of literature about the war. In any event,
                    the two books here reviewed fall clearly into the worthwhile category.</p>

               </hi> is nothing less than a splendid book. The author, John D. Milligan, is a
                    professional historian. The subject of his inquiry is the role played by the <geogName>Mississippi
                        River</geogName> during the war, with particular attention to the naval aspect of the river
                    campaigns. This is a significant subject. It is also one sufficiently limited to permit a deep and
                    well ordered study; and Milligan has given us such a study, based on first rate research and
                    containing sound insights of his own.</p>
            <p>In the Introduction, which effectively sets the stage for the book, Milligan points out the strategic
                    importance of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> and also shows that this importance was contemporaneously understood. He then
                    chronologically traces the story of the opening of the river, beginning with the preparations in
                    1861 and ending with the surrender of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vicksburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Along the way he tells about the river craft which were developed on both sides to
                    fight the water battles; and he effectively sketches the interesting people involved, especially
                    such Union figures as John Rodgers, James B. Eads, and the Elletts. Also included is the story of
                    the army-navy command and tactical relationships as they evolved in the prosecution of what at all
                    times was a combination of land and water warfare.</p>
            <p>The book concludes with a brief statement of the indispensable role of the Navy. This, after all,
                    should not be unexpected in a book published by the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Naval Institute. It is also historically sound and well put and constitutes an
                    effective summary of the implications of the book. The work has no shortcomings. The illustrations
                    and maps are fine. It is well documented and well indexed. It should <pb n="269" id="VAA4025-062-3-099"/> be gratefully received by both scholars and buffs concerned with Civil
                    War history.</p>

                    </placeName> Naval Institute has presented two parallel books about neglected but important figures
                    in the history of American seapower. Christopher Isherwood, engineer in chief of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Navy was the Admiral Rickover of his day: a dedicated, self-assured (some would say
                    egotistical), driving promoter of a new naval technology. Like Rickover, the engineer in chief had
                    enemies including, <pb n="270" id="VAA4025-062-3-100"/> in Isherwood's case, private
                    builders, marine engineers, journalists, congressmen, and certain line officers who resented upstart
                    steam engineers and their expensive machines that consumed so much of the Navy's straitened
                    postwar budget and made old naval virtues seem less important. Eventually Isherwood's
                    opponents brought him down.</p>
            <p>John Roach, Isherwood's contemporary, also acquired enemies during his own career, which
                    sounds like the standard American success and failure story. Roach was a penniless Irish immigrant
                    youth who, through hard work, the application of considerable business acumen and technical
                    knowledge, cultivation of leading politicians, and the occasional appropriation of other
                    people's ideas, made himself the nation's chief builder of ships and marine
                    engines. Like Isherwood, Roach also fell, the victim mainly of excessive optimism that led him to
                    undertake work beyond the limits of his capital. Political antagonists contributed to the ruin of
                    his business. So did government contracting techniques which could enrich a businessman at one time
                    and at another time force him to carry out maddening specification changes in the middle of a job
                    and wait months for payment. Before his departure Roach helped begin the new steel American navy of
                    the 1880's.</p>
            <p>Roach and Isherwood were, in some respects, ahead of their times. Isherwood and a fellow officer
                    together developed a theory of offensive naval power which antedated the comparable ideas of Alfred
                    Thayer Mahan by almost thirty years. Roach followed such modern business practices as distributing
                    stock to his managers to bind them to the company. In the 1870's he began to put together a
                    completely integrated shipyard under his own control from raw material to finished vessels. A mania
                    for automation led Roach to order several laborsaving devices including machines, actuated by alarm
                    clocks, to feed the animals in his yards.</p>
            <p>Swann and Sloan have written symphathtically, perhaps too sympathetically, about their subjects. It
                    is refreshing to observe Swann describe William C. Whitney, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s secretary of the navy and one of the more respectable figures of the gilded
                    era, as the relentless persecutor of a sick old shipbuilder, demanding test after test of one of
                    Roach's naval vessels while holding up payments that might have saved Roach's
                    firm. But Swann might have reminded the reader at this point of facts mentioned earlier which
                    indicate that Whitney could not have been too careful about accepting the old man's work:
                    Roach had been responsible for some shoddy engine construction during the Civil War, had recommended
                    to fellow engine builders that they fabricate figures to squeeze extra money out of the government,
                    had lent one secretary of the navy at least $10,000, and had employed Whitney's
                    predecessor in that office as an influence peddler.</p>
            <p>The chief shortcoming of Sloan's book is that, while it often deals with
                    controversy—Isherwood seems to have been involved in constant controversy during his
                    years as engineer in chief—it does not always go deeply enough into the facts and
                    theories of ship design and engine technology to convince the reader whether Isherwood or his
                    critics made the better case. Readers learn that although the hostile majority <pb n="271" id="VAA4025-062-3-101"/> of one expert board condemmed all of Isherwood's ships, at
                    another time a different group of experts praised the work of the engineer in chief. Which group of
                    experts was correct? The reader wants more than the opinion of authorities and the gist of their
                    arguments. He wants Sloan to lead him painstakingly through the precise details of evidence. The
                    author informs us that Isherwood's famous crusier the <hi rend="i">Wampanoag</hi> was
                    extraordinarily fast for its time, that it influenced British thinking about crusier design, that
                    two members of a three-man board reported that the <hi rend="i">Wampanoag</hi> had sufficient
                    armament as well as speed for destroying commerce and self-defense, and that Isherwood's
                    critics complained that the ship lacked adequate space for crew, supplies, or armament. Fast or not,
                    the <hi rend="i">Wampanoag</hi> may have been a failure. Perhaps in an appendix Sloan might have
                    more thoroughly analysed the evidence to demonstrate what he clearly believes: that the <hi rend="i">Wampanoag</hi> was a success.</p>
            <p>Neither volume, each of which grew from a doctoral dissertation, is a complete biography. The authors
                    did not have the collections of ‘their subjects’ personal papers that might
                    have allowed fuller treatment of the early lives of Roach and Isherwood. They chose wisely to
                    concentrate on the years when their men were relatively prominent and when accounts of their
                    activities were full. Within the limitations they accepted, Swann and Sloan have written books of
                    considerable utility to military and naval historians, to students of business and technology in the
                    nineteenth century, and to those who wish to investigate the historical relationships between
                    industry and the American defense establishment.</p>

                    The growing importance of administrative services and functions in state government is well
                    illustrated by the tremendous expansion of the role of the lieutenant governor of Indiana since
                    1933. This particular issue of <hi rend="i">Indiana Public Affairs Notes</hi> gives emphasis to the
                    expanded duties given the lieutenant governor as head of the Indiana Department of Commerce by the
                    1965 general assembly. It explains his increased services and functions as regards industrial
                    development, economic planning, tourist promotion, and related items. Charles W. Kirk as a former
                    legislator and current executive director of the Indiana Department of Commerce obviously has much
                    firsthand knowledge as a background for his account.</p>

                    Mrs. Nichols indicates that her book is not intended as "a learned treatise" (p.
                    ix). She does, however, offer a variety of interesting and informative sketches and episodes

                    occupation to the 1940's. The importance of the now vanished Grand Marsh as a mecca for
                    hunters and trappers is vividly described. Readers not acquainted with the fact that a considerable
                    amount of native hardwoods once grew along streams and islands will be surprised to read of the

                    Preface states that some revisions have been included which modify the text of the 1948 copy. Still
                    describes his volume as "a success story in American urban development—the
                    chronicle of a city that grew from a wilderness trading post to an admired industrial metropolis in
                    less than a hundred years" (p. vii). Since <hi rend="i">Milwaukee: The History of a

                    abundantly illustrated volume offers a fascinating <pb n="274" id="VAA4025-062-3-104"/> account of
                    the origin and development of the Smithsonian Institution. James Smithson, an Englishman who never
                    visited the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, left his legacy to a nephew with the provision that should the latter die without an
                    heir the estate would go "to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

                    diffusion of Knowledge among men" (p. 9). The nephew died heirless in 1835 and
                    $242,000 of interest accumulated from the legacy while Congress delayed and debated how
                    it should be used. The interest provided the money for an initial building—perhaps the
                    delay of Congress was a blessing in disguise! Robert Dale Owen of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> had an important part in the design of this building. Joseph Henry, the
                    institution's first secretary, emphasized research and publication. The original priority
                    was on natural sciences, followed by varied and augmented programs in other areas. The Smithsonian
                    Institution is an excellent example of outstanding achievement made possible by a combination of
                    public and private support.</p>
