            <p>In the last two decades of the nineteenth century a number of churches in older sections of major
                    cities of the United States expanded their programs to include secular activities. They became known
                    as "institutional" churches since, in addition to the usual religious activities,
                    their programs included instruction in vocational and educational subjects, kindergartens, day
                    nurseries, employment bureaus, dispensaries and clinics, reading rooms, and book clubs. They were
                    characterized by the "open door" and free seats and were like other churches
                    except that they laid "more stress on the total man as the subject of redemption, and the
                    relations of men to each other."<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One of the very first of these institutional churches was established in <placeName>

                    </placeName> (Congregational) Church.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> The minister responsible for its
                    development was Oscar Carleton McCulloch who began his ministry there in 1877. McCulloch's
                    activities as a social reformer reached far outside his church, and his contributions to the
                    development of social welfare in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, the state of Indiana, and the nation warrant more space than can be allotted here.
                    This article, therefore, will focus on the religious and secular program which he built at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Plymouth</settlement>
                    </placeName> Church, stressing particularly its innovative and unorthodox features.</p>
            <p>Oscar McCulloch was born in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Fremont</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, July 2, 1843, the second child and first
                    son of Carlton G. and Harriet L. McCulloch. His father was a druggist and young Oscar left school at
                    fifteen to clerk in his store. At eighteen, after a business course at Eastman's Commercial
                    College, he became a salesman for a wholesale drug company in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> and travelled widely through the South and West. From this experience he learned sound
                    business organizational methods which he put to use in his later career, became a good judge of
                    human character, and, more important, developed a deep concern for people. The foundation for this
                    concern had been laid by his parents in the religious atmosphere of his home and was further
                    developed through his work with the Christian Commission of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> and his service in a mission church of that city between trips during the years he was
                    a salesman. Encouraged by friends who realized his effectiveness as a religious teacher, he <list type="footnotes">

            <p>McCulloch's first pastorate, which he assumed in 1870, was in Sheboygan, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>, where he remained seven years. He received invitations to accept a ministry elsewhere
                    but not until 1877 did he consider them seriously. In March of that year, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hanover</settlement>
                    </placeName> Street Church in Milwaukee asked him to be its minister. The opportunity attracted him:
                    the church was poor, small, and located among factories. He felt qualified for such work and
                    envisioned building a church similar to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Henry</region>
                    </placeName> Ward Beecher's in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brooklyn</settlement>
                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> But he decided to remain in Sheboygan, which he felt was his
                    home: he had come there with his bride; his two sons had been born and his wife Agnes had died
                    there; and he had many friends, "the dearest on earth" in Sheboygan. He recognized
                    that he had helped his parishioners through his sermons, his friendly relations with and
                    understanding of them, his power to make religious truths relevant to them, and his ability to
                    persuade them to accept these truths in their daily lives. He feared that if he left some in the
                    congregation, who had not been to church for years until they came to hear him, would no longer
                    attend church.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> On the other hand, the Sheboygan church was not united. In it
                    was a small, conservative group which acted as a "constant paralysis" to his
                    preaching. They objected to his proposal that the form of receiving members into the church be
                    changed to make it possible for persons to join without accepting the traditional creed, and they
                    criticized his presentation of new religious tenets based on recent scientific developments such as
                    Darwin's theory of evolution.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About a month after receiving the Milwaukee offer, McCulloch was invited to preach at the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Congregational Church in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Commenting on his initial visit there, he wrote: "The church is much run
                    down. The congregations have been very small. Today they were about 175 each sermon."<hi rend="sup">7</hi> The <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> invitation had come about through the suggestion of a close friend of McCulloch, the

                    professional and business, were church attendants and that a strong moral sentiment pervaded the
                    city. He commented, however, "As to the extent to which morals obtain, I cannot
                    say," and then added the significant remark, "They have not had much hand in

                    placed in the Pastor's Box in the vestibule of the Church" were distributed. The
                    card stated that the pastor welcomed information which would enable him to be more helpful to others
                    or which would be useful to him in his work, and that he wished especially to be notified promptly
                    of instances of sickness, destitution, or the presence of a stranger.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> He drew

                            assistance to unemployed young men in finding work, and the provision of summers in the

                    to his church: a natural appeal, a lack of fanfare, and an offering of a service or program to which
                    people could relate without strict conformity to rules or beliefs. The inauguration of the Young
                    Men's Club was marked by a simple announcement that the minister would spend Monday
                    evenings in the parlor of the church. McCulloch arranged to have a few church members present and to
                    have magazines, books, and games available. Later, instructional talks were added, the first of
                    which was on the "new 'Arithmetic' or calculating machine."<hi rend="sup">23</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While there was an initial response to the Young Men's Club, McCulloch's
                    congregation, like those of Christian churches in general, was not ready to give wholehearted
                    support to the development of a secular program. This lack of response may have been due in part to
                    the difficult times. The prolonged depression which began with the financial panic of 1873 was still
                    in force and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> had been particularly hard hit.<hi rend="sup">24</hi> The church continued to be
                    heavily in debt and to have difficulty in raising funds for the minister's salary.
                    McCulloch himself had to collect pledges, secure loans, and repeatedly bring to the attention of the
                    trustees the fact that his salary was not paid on time. It is no wonder that he wrote in his diary:
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>These days lie upon me as a great burden…. It may be due to the depressed times,
                            or to the dark grey days, I know not, but the people seem so miserable. The homes of the
                            poor are dark and bare. There are many out of work… many sick, sorrowing and
                                hopeless.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>
                  </p>
                    </quote> He recognized that social inequities could not be changed in a moment because of
                    "the shiftlessness of the poor or the indifference of the rich." But he was
                    disheartened because those who attended church seemed to have no interest in helping their
                    unfortunate fellow men. "They attend Church on Sunday," he wrote,
                    "but… the mid-day meeting, the activities of the church receive no enthusiastic
                    attention. The outlook is not altogether bright today."<hi rend="sup">26</hi>
            </p>
            <p>McCulloch's preaching, however, attracted to the church a larger congregation and, as had
                    been true in Sheboygan, it included persons who were in agreement with his liberal interpretation of
                    Christianity. Some asked to become members of his church. Among them was David Starr Jordan, a
                    professor of natural history at <placeName>

                    church committee, McCulloch was uncertain whether approval would be granted, for he wrote in his
                    diary: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>McCulloch was a slight wiry man who preached his sermons from a minimum of notes. His tone was more
                    conversational and his manner less formal than that of most ministers. His texts were chosen from
                    both the Old and New Testaments with the religious thoughts and lessons interpreted in terms of
                    current issues or commonplace happenings. The message directed at his listeners was clearly
                    expressed in well chosen but easily understood language. He did not hesitate to preach on the
                    relation of capital to labor, on labor unions, shorter working hours, the widespread dishonesty
                    existing in business practices, the exploitation of child labor and women workers, or the unsanitary
                    and crowded living conditions of the poor.<hi rend="sup">33</hi> He believed that anything which
                    concerned the welfare of individuals concerned the church. These social issues, which stemmed from
                    the industrial revolution and the unrest following the Civil War, caused growing concern during the
                    last quarter of the nineteenth century. They led to the rise of the Social Gospel movement to which
                    McCulloch contributed but which was exemplified more widely in the preachings and writings of <placeName>

            <p>McCulloch believed it was his business as a minister to concern himself with the cause of those who
                    worked; he stated that his sympathies were with those who lived "close to the line of bare
                        existence."<hi rend="sup">35</hi> He saw social unrest as characteristic of the times;
                    he believed the danger of this unrest threatening social institutions could be averted by organizing
                    trade unions. One of his sermons on this theme was taken from the text, "There be many
                    servants now a days that break away every man from his master" (I Samuel 15:10). While he
                    supported the formation of unions and emphasized that their members should know and dare to maintain
                    their rights, he also stressed that they should know their duties, practice selfcontrol,
                    nonviolence, and conciliation, and follow the cardinal doctrine of
                    Christianity—selfsacrifice—submitting the good of the individual to the good
                    of the class.<hi rend="sup">36</hi> In a Sunday evening sermon on "The Right of
                    Protest" he recognized the right of labor to strike and drew parallels with the Reformation
                    and its leader, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Martin</region>
                    </placeName> Luther: "It is only by the protestants that the earth is kept alive. You and I
                    must protest against religious wrong, against political wrong, against social wrong. Then will come
                    the reformation. There is need of reformation, else there will be revolution."<hi rend="sup">37</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In an attempt to call the attention of capitalists to the need of social reform, he preached a
                    sermon, "Boys Are Scarcer Than Dollars," based on the story of David and Absalom
                    (IV Samuel 18:33). In it he stressed the evils of dollar worship, child labor, and twelve-hour
                    working days.<hi rend="sup">38</hi> That all employers—housewives as well as their
                    husbands—should pay fair wages and abide by the Golden Rule was the message of another
                    sermon entitled "The Well-To-Do and the <placeName>

            <p>Messages touching the common things of life were frequently brought to the congregation in sermons
                    with such subjects as "Freedom and Obligation," "The Value of our
                    Institutions," "The Value of Common Things," and "Young Men and
                    the Church."<hi rend="sup">40</hi> Sometimes he spoke without a text to emphasize the
                    problems of the poor in <placeName>

                    on local and national events to involve his congregations in working toward social justice. In his
                    discourse, "Treatment of the Guilty," he criticized the people of the city for the
                    feeling of satisfied revenge which was evident when two murderers were convicted and punished by
                    execution. He urged his listeners to consider the conditions society allowed which contributed to
                    crimes and urged them <list type="footnotes">

                    that it must "soon be relegated to the past" because "better methods will

                    of two earlier canvasses of the congregation, a special meeting of the congregation was called
                    during May to consider what should be done.<hi rend="sup">45</hi> There is no mention of such a
                    meeting in McCulloch's diary or in later minutes of the Board of Trustees, nor is there
                    evidence that a memorandum in McCulloch's handwriting addressed to "Gentlemen of
                    the Board of Trustees" and inserted in his diary under August 10, 1880, was considered by
                    the trustees. This memorandum offered a plan for taking care of the mortgage and other indebtedness
                    of the church amounting to $14,000 which would become due on May 1, 1881. Set out in
                    detail, the plan indicated McCulloch's business acumen.<hi rend="sup">46</hi> He candidly
                    pointed out, however, that the first thing to consider was whether it was worthwhile to attempt to
                    save the church, a decision for the board to make. He proposed the issue in such a drastic manner to
                    force church members to take a stand and put the church on a sounder financial basis. In
                    McCulloch's opinion this action—maintaining the church—was advisable.
                    His reasons included the church's excellent central location and the "prestige
                    attached to long occupancy."<hi rend="sup">47</hi>

                            secured through the rent paid by the church. McCulloch indicated in the plan how much would
                            be amortized each year from 1882 to 1891, when the entire debt would be paid off.</item>

                    The purchase price of $15,000 was little more than the mortgage on the church but it was
                    accepted since a proposed building to be constructed by English would have cut off air and light

                    preached his last sermon there on December 31, 1882.<hi rend="sup">50</hi> During his ministry at
                    this location, the membership grew very slowly, financial support was difficult, and the
                    "institutional" program became well established, but did not experience any
                    outstanding period of expansion. To be sure, the Young Men's Club had been put on a firmer
                    basis in 1879 with a more active program; weekday talks on social topics and Sunday evening lectures
                    had been instituted. David Starr Jordan had delivered the first of these lectures on
                    "Agassiz or the Religion of Science." The Ladies <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Union</region>
                    </placeName> of the church had established an industrial school to teach sewing to young girls and a
                    maternity society to help women during confinement.<hi rend="sup">51</hi> In September, 1881,
                    McCulloch proposed to the Board of Trustees a resumption of the Sunday evening service which had
                    been discontinued in 1879 so that he could devote more time to the development of the Sunday
                        School.<hi rend="sup">52</hi> Like many other Social Gospel ministers, McCulloch was concerned
                    that his church was not reaching the laboring classes. Therefore, he desired to have Sunday evening
                    services devoted "especially to railroad men and mechanics and those who did not attend
                    church anywhere," and to have a short address and a half hour's concert and song
                    service with a quartet-choir.<hi rend="sup">53</hi> The members of the board were wholeheartedly in
                    favor of this plan and gave unanimous approval to McCulloch's request to have the proceeds
                    of the evening collection set aside for the payment of the choir or other special uses of the
                        service.<hi rend="sup">54</hi>

                    about seventy-five attended and $3.68 was collected. Rationalization by McCulloch of the
                    small attendance is indicated by the comment in his diary that the evening was "very
                        rainy."<hi rend="sup">56</hi> The following week, the congrega- <list type="footnotes">

                    were among the topics given by McCulloch.<hi rend="sup">59</hi> Daniel P. Baldwin, attorney general
                    of Indiana, spoke on "Lessons from the Life of [James A.] Garfield."<hi rend="sup">60</hi> The following year, in a lecture series entitled "Workers with God,"
                    McCulloch discussed Charles Dickens, a writer whose life and characters exemplified charity and
                    sympathy toward all human beings, and Alfred Tennyson, whom he characterized as a worker with God in
                        poetry.<hi rend="sup">61</hi>

            <p>McCulloch received both approbation and criticism as a result of the lecture series. The talks were

                    beliefs, referred to him as one of the progressive ministers of the age, describing him as
                    "a searcher after truth," a man who was "struggling to free himself from
                    the fetters of orthodoxy," and who was "little, if anything, more than an Orthodox

            <p>Another correspondent, Hugo O. Pantzer, though not in agreement with McCulloch's religious
                    views, wrote him nonetheless to express his personal satisfaction in the minister's
                    efforts. He attributed McCulloch's success to a "sincere and earnest conviction
                    carried by a courageous and untiring effort," and added: "By your ways you set an
                    inspiring and worthy example for which I personally thank you. The manifold, good and liberal
                    purpose of the edifice you planned and realized does you honor."<hi rend="sup">72</hi>

            <p>Architecturally the new building was less attractive than the old one. It had more the appearance of
                    a school than a place of worship; its style was functional rather than the traditional Gothic of its
                    former home. But McCulloch's intent was that the building should be both a
                    people's church and a people's college, and he had designed it with a wide variety
                    of uses in mind.<hi rend="sup">73</hi> The auditorium, which had over 1,200 seats, including
                    approximately 350 in the gallery, was to be used for church services, concerts, public meetings, and
                    "other gatherings for public good."<hi rend="sup">74</hi> Smaller rooms were
                    provided for classes, games, and a library, and other space was available for lease to civic

                    conviction that the most economical and best way to help the poor was through an organization of

                    </placeName> Church building, criticism was sharp. It came primarily from ministers of other

            <p>Two events of special significance to McCulloch as well as to the development of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Plymouth</settlement>
                    </placeName> Church occurred during its first year in its new home: the amendment of the church
                    constitution and the organization of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Plymouth</settlement>
                    </placeName> Institute.<hi rend="sup">80</hi> Both events must have given McCulloch great
                    satisfaction. The amended constitution stated that all persons were eligible for membership who
                    pledged themselves willing "to undertake such work as may be thought to lie within the
                    scope of a Christian church." An applicant was not committed to any particular philosophy
                    of faith; a Christian spirit and Christian character were the only requisites of membership.<hi rend="sup">81</hi> This change was recognized as responsible for a very encouraging increase in
                    the church membership.<hi rend="sup">82</hi> As noted previously, a similar change, desired by
                    McCulloch but rejected by his congregation in Sheboygan, had led to his resignation as minister
                    there.</p>
            <p>The organization of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Institute in November, 1884, fulfilled McCulloch's early plan for the church
                    program to provide educational and cultural opportunities for the young people of the community. Its
                    specific purpose was stated as "increasing fellowship among young people… and
                    bringing them under such influences as shall secure their moral, educational, industrial and social
                    advancement by the best practical methods."<hi rend="sup">83</hi> McCulloch hoped its
                    development and value would be comparable to that of the Young Men's Christian <placeName>

                    became members.<hi rend="sup">85</hi> Within three months, there were 97 enrollees in classes in
                    literature, French, German, current history, stenography, bookkeeping, drawing, and elocution. By
                    the end of the first year 179 young people had joined.<hi rend="sup">86</hi> Most of the classes met
                    in the evening as they were intended primarily to serve people who were employed. The students, for
                    the most part, were young men and women who worked in stores, offices, shops, and factories. The
                    popularity of the program can be seen by the fact that many of the students entered two or more
                        classes.<hi rend="sup">87</hi> In its offering of classes the <placeName>

                    himself carried a large share of the lectures, drawing upon his rich background and extensive
                    knowledge of literature, history, and science.</p>
            <p>McCulloch continuously experimented with ways of reaching laboring men and women and bringing them
                    into the church. One of his most successful experiments, which was copied elsewhere, was the
                    illustrated sermon. Stereoptican slides of well-known paintings were shown in connection with Sunday
                    evening services. At the first illustrated sermon, the topic was "Christ in Art"
                    which was illustrated by such pictures as Correggio's "Holy Night,"
                    Raphael's "Sistine Madonna," Hoffman's "Chirst in the
                    Temple," and Del Sarto's "Baptism of Christ." Hymns were also
                    projected on the screen and sung by the congregation. At a later service, he used
                    "Laocoön" and "Apollo Belvidere" to illustrate
                    Paul's thought of "Bondage and Freedom." Slides of paintings were also
                    used with sermons such as "The Childhood of Jesus," "The Sermon on the
                    Mount," and "Teaching by Parables." People soon filled the auditorium,
                    with, at times, 100 to 200 people being turned away; the increase in the collection was sufficient
                    to pay for the cost of the slides.<hi rend="sup">97</hi> McCulloch also reported "a largely
                    increased congregation" at the Sunday morning service, a fourfold attendance gain at weekly
                    meetings, and young people "numbering 100 strong" in the Sunday School.<hi rend="sup">98</hi>

            <p>In a message to the people of his church in 1889, he wrote: "The work we have undertaken to
                    do is part of a new movement in church work, it may be called a new departure in Christianity. It is
                    the attempt to put the church in touch with the masses of the people."<hi rend="sup">99</hi> He went on to say that the problem of the modern city church was to find ways of utilizing
                    the best results of scientific and critical thought, of reaching those who did not attend church,
                    interesting the "restless young," teaching the ignorant the ways of a better life,
                    and alleviating and preventing the troubles of the poor. He concluded his message by pointing out
                    that it was the responsibility of members of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Plymouth</settlement>
                    </placeName> Church to help solve these problems by working through the four central ideas of the
                    church program—worship, education, social life, and charity—and that it was as
                    important for them to help the people of their own community as to support missionary work in the
                    remote parts of the world.<hi rend="sup">100</hi>
            </p>
            <p>McCulloch's concept of the responsibility of church members and the church program to the
                    community was an extension of his concept of how a minister should relate to the community. He held
                    that a minister must identify himself with the community's life and concerns—the
                    welfare and education of its children, the organization of its character, its moral condition, and
                    its commercial and industrial interests.<hi rend="sup">101</hi> McCulloch carried out this
                    philosophy in <placeName>

                    </placeName> and, in some respects, in the wider community of the state and the country. He either
                    led or founded nearly all of the social agencies in existence during the fourteen years he lived in <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Many of these agencies are still operating today although in some instances their
                    names have changed. His interest and contribution to the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Benevolent Society and the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Charity Organization Society have already been mentioned. Other important agencies with
                    which he was associated and whose programs he influenced included the Friendly Inn and Woodyard; the
                    Children's Aid Society; the Free Kindergarten; the Flower Mission Training School for
                    Nurses, which was established within the city hospital in 1883, and which two years later made
                    possible the initiation of a visiting nurse service to the sick poor; and the Summer Mission for
                    Sick Children, a fresh air camp constructed in Fairview Park, now the location of <placeName>

            <p>McCulloch died of Hodgkin's disease on December 10, 1891, at the age of forty-eight. With
                    his death, <placeName>

                    development and influence in the church's history came to an end. For approximately a

                    </placeName> Church had been the center of cultural and charitable activities of the city, but the
                    program which McCulloch developed came at least ten years too soon to be sustained without his
                    vision and leadership.<hi rend="sup">107</hi> During the 1890's and immediately after the
                    turn of the century, the kind of church which he had helped to build grew rapidly in other cities of
                    the country. Contributing to the expansion of these churches was the formation in 1894 of the Open
                    and Institutional Church League. The league was a national body which formalized a platform for
                    institutional churches, conducted annual conventions, and published a monthly paper, <hi rend="i">The Open Door</hi>, to deal with varied aspects of the problems and programs of these city

                    from 1941 until his retirement to emeritus service in 1965. From 1947 until 1953 he served the

            <p>As a teacher and writer Professor Barnhart's principal interest was the history of the
                        <geogName>Ohio Valley</geogName> and the Old Northwest. He was the author of more than two dozen
                    articles and many book reviews which appeared in historical quarterlies throughout the United
                    States. His first published volume was <hi rend="i">

                    with Donald F. Carmony. A byproduct of this history was <hi rend="i">Indiana: The Hoosier State</hi>
                    (1959; rev. 1963), co-authored with Donald F. Carmony, Opal M. Nichols, and Jack E. Weicker. This
                    book has been used as a junior high school history text in Indiana schools.</p>
            <p>As editor of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> Professor Barnhart edited perhaps six
                    or seven thousand pages of articles, documents, and book reviews. In his research and writing he
                    reflected the basic views of his mentor, Frederick <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jackson</region>
                    </placeName> Turner, concerning the impact of the American frontier on the development of American
                    life and institutions. Professor Barnhart's work also gave much emphasis to the
                    contributions of southerners to the development of the <geogName>Ohio Valley</geogName> and Old
                    Northwest, especially during the period from about 1750 through the Civil War years.</p>
            <p>In spite of the enormous amount of time he gave to teaching, research, editing, writing, and
                    administration, Professor Barnhart also gave much time to professional organizations and public
                    service. During World War II he served as chairman of the Indiana War History Commission; he was

            <p>Through the years Professor Barnhart had a devoted interest in his students, undergraduates and
                    graduates alike. Although committed to his own high principles of scholarship and character, he
                    exercised understanding, kindness, generosity, and restraint in his evaluation of colleagues and
                    students. During the long illness which preceded his death on December 25, 1967, he exhibited
                    infinite patience, forbearance, and heroism. Professor Barnhart is survived by his widow, Mrs. Zella

                    extent and significance of his writing.</p>

            <p>During Indiana's Sesquicentennial celebration in 1966 the Indiana State Library conducted
                    and administered a statewide search for manuscripts relating to the state's 150 years of
                    historical development. Through this program, known as the Indiana Sesquicentennial Manuscript
                    Project, manuscripts were collected and xerox or microfilm copies of them were distributed to a
                    number of libraries within the state.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Contributions desired by the project were divided into two categories: personal items such as
                    letters, diaries, journals, account books, sermons, speeches, and reminiscences; and privately
                    printed items such as commencement programs, business and industrial catalogs, broadsides, maps, and
                    pamphlets.</p>
            <p>All manuscript material was sent or delivered to the Indiana State Library. Here the project director
                    and his assistants sorted the contributions and arranged pages for copying. An accurate record of
                    each entry, its contents, and the date it was returned was entered in a ledger book. All items were
                    copied either by xerox or microfilm. Some typed or transcribed copies of original manuscripts were
                    submitted. In a few cases a copy was made from another copy of an original when the whereabouts of
                    the original was unknown. Shipments were sent to cooperating libraries approximately every three
                    months.</p>
            <p>All in all, some 60,000 pages of manuscript materials were contributed to the project. As hoped,
                    items covering a variety of subjects and times ranging from pre-statehood to the present day came in
                    from all sections of the state.</p>
            <p>The format in the following guide roughly corresponds with that used by the Library of Congress in
                        <hi rend="i">The National <placeName>

                    appropriate headings. An index to the guide has been prepared and will be deposited with each of the
                    cooperating libraries. Part II of the guide is scheduled for publication in the <hi rend="i">Indiana
                        Magazine of History</hi> in September, 1968.</p>
            <p>A great majority of the papers collected deal with private citizens—not prominent national
                    or local figures. Their personal diaries and letters were written without fear of retribution. Such
                    might not have been the case with elected officials. For the most part they contain much information
                    about family births and deaths, weather, illnesses, marriages, names of children, and comparable
                    items. However, the items gathered also contain considerable information of political, social, and
                    economic value.</p>

            <p>A number of people were instrumental in making the project a success. Only a few of them can be named
                    here. Mention must be made of the services of Mrs. Hazel Hopper, head, Indiana Division, Indiana
                    State Library; her staff members Miss Louise Wood, Miss Martha Wright, Mrs. Frances Macdonald, Mrs.
                    Feme Roseman, and Miss Carol Deschler. Miss Carol Jarvis was the project assistant. Miss Margaret
                    Pierson and Mr. Earl Anderson of the Archives Division of the State Library were responsible for
                    much of the microfilming done for the project.</p>
            <p>An explanation of the entries will be helpful to users of the guide. The first section of each entry
                    contains the name of the person, family, or place under which the entry is catalogued; next is the
                    entry title or heading, the inclusive dates of the item or n.d. (no date), the number of items, and
                    the number of pages in the item. The second section describes the scope and content of the item and
                    gives the county discussed in the item. The third section indicates the name of the contributor or
                    the location of the original. In the fourth section, identifying numbers assigned by the project are
                    given: the manuscript project number, preceded by (X) for xerox or (M) for microfilm (or, for
                    example, M-2, to indicate the second entry on a microfilm reel). The final number, the MS number,
                    indicates how entries may be found in the index to the guide.</p>
            <p>EDITOR'S NOTE: Thomas Krasean, compiler of the guide which follows, has indicated that the
                    Indiana Sesquicentennial Manuscript Project was sponsored by the Indiana Sesquicentennial Commission
                    in cooperation with nine leading libraries around the state. The emphasis of the project was on
                    locating and reproducing valuable manuscript material pertaining to any important topic, aspect, or
                    personality of Indiana's history. The success of the project was largely the result of two
                    forces: the awards offered by Governor Roger D. Branigin to the three counties making the most
                    impressive contributions to the program; and the important role played by members of the staff of
                    the Indiana State Library, especially those associated with the Indiana Division. Mr. Krasean,
                    however, has been too modest to suggest that he himself was the director of the project. He has
                    written a detailed description of the project in the November, 1967 issue of <hi rend="i">History
                        News</hi>, published by the American Association for State and Local History.</p>
            <p>Fortunately the Indiana Division of the Indiana State Library is carrying forward its collection of
                    manuscripts pertaining to Indiana's historical development. Individuals who have relevant
                    material which has not been xeroxed are encouraged to make it available to Thomas Krasean, field
                    representative, Indiana Division, Indiana State Library, State Library and Historical Building, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana 46402. The Indiana Division welcomes the donation of original manuscripts but
                    is also willing to xerox originals and return them to owners who wish to contribute to the project
                    in this way. This important program should continue as a vital and permanent part of the Indiana
                    State Library's services. Certainly, the collection of manuscripts which began with the
                    observance of Indiana's 150th birthday of statehood should more than double during the
                    decade subsequent thereto.</p>

            <head>Awards of Merit and Certificates of Commendation from American Association for State and Local
                    History</head>
            <p>All nominations must be made on the "Awards Nomination Form" and<hi rend="i">postmarked by not later than June 29, 1968</hi>. Each nominator must include a supporting
                    letter which is explicit in indicating why the award or certificate seems merited. Each nominator is
                    also responsible for making certain that at least two or three other persons send similar statements
                        <hi rend="i">directly to the state chairman</hi>. Finally, each nominator should send relevant
                    supporting material such as pamphlets, newspaper clippings, programs, scripts, and books. The views
                    and evaluations of various persons will be considered regarding each nomination.</p>
            <p>1. <hi rend="i">Certificate of Commendation</hi>. The Certificate of Commendation is given for
                    outstanding achievement by an individual or an organization in the field of state, provincial, and
                    local history, but with that achievement judged in the light of local limiting circumstances rather
                    than on a basis of over-all excellence in the United States and Canada as a whole. This is an award
                    of encouragement and commendation to a person or group which by great effort has accomplished
                    something that is really outstanding within its own area. It matters not that the accomplishment is
                    less than the achievements of similar groups in wealthier or more sophisticated areas of the
                    country. The certificate is a pat on the back and says to the individual or organization that
                    receives it: "We think you are doing a wonderful job in your area, and we want to recognize
                    you for it."</p>
            <p>2. <hi rend="i">The Award of Merit</hi>. This was the original award of the American Association for
                    State and Local History and is still the backbone of its competition. It is given for excellence of
                    accomplishment or program in the field of state, provincial, and local history, and is in no way
                    judged relative to local limiting circumstances. The giving of the Award of Merit is the same as
                    saying to everyone: "This is public acknowledgement by the American Association for State
                    and Local History that this accomplishment or this program, in comparison with all similar
                    accomplishments and programs in North America, deserves the adjective excellent." The term
                    "excellent" is not employed in the archaic sense of excelling all others, but in
                    the modern sense of extremely good, first class, of great inherent worth. This distinction is
                    important because it should be clearly understood that an award to one organization for a particular
                    kind of program does not bar another organization from receiving an award for a similar program, if
                    both programs are indeed excellent.</p>

            <p>The most recent addition to the new <hi rend="i">Urban Life in America</hi> series is the revised
                    doctoral dissertation of one of Richard Wade's graduate students at the University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In a scholarly and illuminating fashion, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jackson</region>
                    </placeName> devotes the greater part of his book to a detailed description of Klan composition,
                    activities, and influence in nine major American cities: <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Atlanta</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
               </placeName>, Dallas,
                            <placeName>

               </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Portland</settlement>
                    </placeName>. By employing a variation of the case study method, the author reveals the considerable
                    influence of the urban Klans in both state and national organizations and makes a strong case for
                    his assertion that the city klansmen provided most of the leadership, resources, and the essential
                    dynamics of the movement. The typical urban Klan member is characterized as a lower middle-class,
                    blue-collar worker who had less education and community status than his country counterpart and came
                    from a neighborhood whose residential stability was threatened by European immigrants and Negroes
                    moving from farm to city and from South to North. The author's research leads him to the
                    conclusion that the Klan was "not a reaction against the rise of the city to dominance in
                    American life," but "rather a reaction against the aspirations of certain elements
                    within the city" (p. 245).</p>
            <p>Despite his efforts, however, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jackson</region>
                    </placeName>'s work does not seriously challenge the commonly accepted view that the Ku
                    Klux Klan of the 1920's was essentially an expression of the decline of rural America and
                    its value system in the face of the rising modern, industrial society found in the cities. To
                    suggest that the Klan was not rural in its mentality simply because it was active and influential in
                    several carefully selected cities, which are not representative of the entire nation, is neither
                    logical nor justified.</p>
            <p>Although rich in descriptive detail and well written, the case studies are, like much Klan
                    literature, somewhat disjointed and often filled with inconsequential facts which do little to
                    support the author's case. While the book's documentation is generally handled in
                    a careful, scholarly fashion, there are occasional lapses when certain critical statements are not
                    supported. For example, the assertions that 500 of the 1,300 delegates to the 1924 Indiana State
                    Republican Convention were loyal to Grand Dragon David C. Stephenson (p. 155) and that the Klan
                    elected the governor and a majority of the state legislature (p. 156) would seem to require some
                    form of substantiation.</p>
            <p>These criticisms are somewhat mitigated by the many problems encountered in attempting to penetrate
                    the mysteries of the Invisible Empire. The dearth of source material, which is largely the result of
                    the secrecy of the order and the reluctance of individuals to divulge information about their <pb n="152" id="VAA4025-064-2-066"/> association with a thoroughly discredited organization, makes
                    Klan research a very difficult and frustrating experience.</p>
            <p>The most valuable portion of the book is the brief but perceptive concluding section which presents
                    the central findings of the study. Another outstanding feature is the annotated
                    bibliography—one of the most exhaustive compilations of Klan primary and secondary
                    sources.</p>
            <p>The spadework done by Jackson is an important contribution to Klan literature and prepares the way
                    for more intensive work on the subject. Some of the author's contentions, such as his
                    assertions that there is a significant correlation between urban population growth and Klan success,
                    that economic philosophy was not an important Klan concern, and that urban klansmen were in the main
                    not recent rural migrants, will require further probing before they can be accepted as valid. A
                    definitive history of the Klan in the city remains to be written inasmuch as many questions are left
                    unsettled, unfocused, or unraised.</p>

            <p>In his introduction the author states: "This book reveals that prejudice against Negroes was
                    a factor in the development of antislavery feeling in the ante-bellum United States" (p.
                    1). He amasses irrefutable evidence to support this thesis in his study, which deals with the states
                    of the Old Northwest plus <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>, <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>, <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Berwanger shows that anti-Negro sentiment became more pronounced in the years from 1846 to 1860, the
                    same period in which the controversy over the extension of slavery became most acute. He
                    demonstrates that in all the states and territories under consideration opposition to the expansion
                    of slavery and proposals to exclude free Negroes were linked and were often advocated by the same
                    groups. Many Republican leaders emphasized that they opposed slavery in the territories because they
                    wanted to preserve those lands exclusively for white men. In <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName> a popular campaign slogan was: "WE ARE FOR LAND FOR THE LANDLESS, NOT NIGGERS
                    FOR THE NIGGERLESS" (p. 131).</p>
            <p>Probably the most striking contribution of the book is its demonstration that emigrants from the
                    older states of the Middle West carried their racial attitudes to the new territories of the West.
                    Thus the story of Indiana and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>

                    </placeName>, where the settlers showed themselves to be both antislavery and anti-Negro. In every
                    case proposals to legalize slavery were rejected; but in every case proposals to exclude free
                    Negroes were adopted or at least seriously considered. In <pb n="153" id="VAA4025-064-2-067"/>

                    </placeName>) were unconcerned about the morality of slavery, but they saw in the antislavery

                    which was ratified by a large margin in a referendum. The fact that the Wyandotte Constitution of

                    congressional opposition. But this constitution denied Negroes the right to vote and permitted
                    segregated schools.</p>

            <p>This substantial volume traces the history of the State Historical Society of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> from its halting beginnings in 1846 to the proud rededication of its building in 1955.
                    The story is one of impressive achievement in the preservation and dissemination of the American
                    heritage. A central feature of that achievement has been the development of the society's
                    library—described by Frederick <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jackson</region>
                    </placeName> Turner as "one of the great treasures of the country." Of equal
                    importance have been the society's broad educational programs through which the people of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> have become meaningfully involved in their past. A great influence in shaping the
                    history of the society has been its close association with the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>—for many years the society's library was the
                    university's—and the society has also had an important influence on the
                    university, having been a significant force in the development of its program in American history.</p>
            <p>Appropriately, the story centers around the careers of the men who served the society as chief
                    administrator: Lyman Copeland Draper, Reuben Gold Thwaites, Milo M. Quaife, Joseph C. Schafer, and
                    Edward P. Alexander. <pb n="154" id="VAA4025-064-2-068"/> Draper is justly celebrated for his
                    efforts in establishing the society and in building its collections, but it is Thwaites who emerges
                    preeminent as the builder of the State Historical Society of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> in its present form. Thwaites became associated with the society in 1885 as
                    Draper's assistant. Two years later, upon Draper's retirement, he became
                    "corresponding secretary," and until his death in 1913 served as the
                    society's chief administrator. During these years the society secured its own building,
                    enlarged and systematized its collections, developed a highly competent professional staff,
                    established a firm relationship with the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>, and began a program of public education that extended to all parts of the state. While
                    leading this growing enterprise, Thwaites wrote fifteen volumes and was responsible for editing 183.
                    Quaife and later Schafer continued, and in some respects improved upon, Thwaites' scholarly
                    activities, but neither had the administrative abilities to manage the complex organization which
                    Thwaites had created, and the society, particularly during the depression years of the
                    1930's, went into a serious decline. Edward P. Alexander, who became superintendent upon
                    Schafer's death in 1941, began the task of rebuilding which was to place <placeName>

                    </placeName> again in the forefront of the historical society movement—a task that was
                    carried to fulfillment by Clifford L. Lord, who became director in 1946 and who is much too modest
                    in writing of his own accomplishments.</p>
            <p>As Lord suggests in the preface, this is both an administrator's history and a family
                    history. As such, it is burdened in spots with more detail than the non-<placeName>

                    narrative sustains the reader's interest. As a definitive study of one of the
                    nation's great societies, <hi rend="i">Clio's Servant</hi> makes a significant
                    contribution to our understanding of the historical society as an institution.</p>

            <p>Z. Z. Lydens, veteran newspaperman and editor of <hi rend="i">The Story of Grand Rapids</hi>, is
                    obviously proud of his city; his city has every right to be proud of this book. Produced under the
                    auspices of the Grand Rapids Historical Commission, <hi rend="i">The Story</hi> is a cooperative
                    project, with thirty-one persons listed as contributing editors. The remarkable unity, organization,
                    and homogeneity of style should doubtless be attributed to the firm editorial hand of Lydens.</p>
            <p>The first ten chapters, which trace the development of municipal government from pioneer days to the
                    present, are organized chronologically. The remaining twenty-nine chapters are topical and include a
                    broad range of city concerns—from hotels to cemeteries to sewers. The emphasis is on the
                    twentieth century, with references to 1966 occurring from the very first chapters. No worshipper of
                    the past, Lydens forthrightly describes such an unpalatable <pb n="155" id="VAA4025-064-2-069"/>
                    phase of Grand Rapids' history as the water scandal of the 1890's. Nor does he
                    dwell on only nineteenth-century controversies. Lydens notes the bitterness resulting from the
                    resignation of a school superintendent in 1949, as well as the infighting involved in the
                    appointment of city managers. Although the narrative is studded with dates, names, and facts, the
                    author writes with verve and in a sprightly style. He skillfully weaves detail into many a
                    fascinating incident. In describing the "piggeries," which performed the function
                    of municipal garbage disposal well into the twentieth century, Lydens relates that one day the pigs
                    "disposed" of peaches pickled in alcohol and got drunk.</p>
            <p>Curiously, Lydens concludes that the history of Grand Rapids is "much like" that of
                    other American cities (p. 8). Yet several distinctive features emerge from the book. A pioneer in
                    the city-manager form of government, Grand Rapids has not been well served by city
                    managers—"tribulations were manifest …" (p. 72). The nub of
                    the problem, according to the editor, is that commissioners "delegate some of their
                    sovereignty to a hired hand [the city manager] while remaining responsible for the hired
                    hand's actions" (p. 72).</p>
            <p>Though Lydens carefully emphasizes that Grand Rapids has always had a diversified economy, certainly
                    the furniture industry has been preeminent and made Grand Rapids a synonym for high quality
                    furniture. In part, the industry thrived because of the presence of skilled Dutch craftsmen. Some 30
                    percent of the city's residents in 1966, the Dutch have constituted the distinctive ethnic
                    element in the population. Their austere, intense religious faith made their churches, as well as
                    their parochial schools, central in their lives. The Dutch, conservative, strong in "purity
                    of heart," with "fixed and burning eyes on sin" (p. 87), lived on the
                    east side of the city; the political opposition, liberal Poles and Lithuanians, lived on the west
                    side and "found it hard necessarily to equate fun with sin" (p. 87).</p>
            <p>The book is not cluttered with footnotes. The preface and bibliography indicate that its principal
                    sources are newspapers, earlier local histories, and materials donated or loaned by the public. Some
                    70,000 "item cards" based on these materials provided the "string on
                    which the beads of the Grand Rapids story were strung" (p. ix). With the exception of some
                    short quotations from Civil War diaries, no manuscript sources were utilized.</p>
            <p>Technically, the book is impressive. Its attractive format results from wide margins, full-color
                    illustrations, high quality paper, and excellent printing. The subject and name indices are helpful;
                    the proofreading, meticulous. Concern for accuracy of statement is obvious.</p>
            <p>The chairman of the Grand Rapids Historical Commission fixed among the purposes of the book:
                    "to illuminate the past … to shed light on the present," and to aid
                    planning for the future (p. xvii). Such a statement is peculiarly ironic since the year after
                    publication, 1967, was also the year of racial riots at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newark</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and the short section of the book devoted to Negroes scarcely hints at racial
                    difficulties. Such an omission in an otherwise excellent history is in itself a commentary on
                    twentieth-century urban America.</p>

            <p>An analytical narrative of "the opposition," <hi rend="i">The Whig Party in <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                        </placeName>
               </hi> is an important addition to the still rather small number of studies of
                    political institutions at the state level during the middle period. The author finds origins of the
                    party in the presidential election of 1824-1825, but Whiggery was a tardy development, and although
                    the term "Whig" was used in 1835 to refer to the <placeName>

                        <region type="county">Jackson</region>
                    </placeName>, or opposition party, it was not until 1838 or 1839 that a Whig party appeared as an
                    organization. During the decade 1830-1840 and most of the following ten years Mering finds that it
                    functioned more as a "political pressure group" than as a "political
                    party." Throughout its entire existence of thirty years until its sudden (and in
                    Mering's view complete) destruction in 1855 the Whig party in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> was almost always a minority and thus generally unsuccessful in winning elections and
                    appointments.</p>
            <p>The story is told largely in terms of thirty-five leaders at the state level, almost all of them
                    Whigs, and it centers on congressional, gubernatorial, and presidential campaigns and elections.
                    Maneuverings for nominations, calculations of the course to pursue between <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Benton</region>
                    </placeName> and anti-<placeName>
                        <region type="county">Benton</region>
                    </placeName> wings of the Democratic party, and attitudes toward questions of public (state and
                    national) policy provide much of the substance. Lawyers and editors rather than planters, farmers,
                    or businessmen thus dominate the stage. The "common man," the voter, whether Whig
                    or Democrat, is seldom seen except statistically. No extended treatment is given to the development
                    of committees, public meetings, electioneering, tickets, ballots, or voting practices, and there is
                    almost nothing on the relation between state and local politics.</p>
            <p>Three early chapters present a detailed survey, analysis, and interpretation of social and economic
                    data. "Certainly," writes the author, "slaveowners tended to identify
                    with the Democratic party" (p. 62). But to balance this view he notes "the greater
                    wealth of the Whig party and the more impressive educational attainments of its leadership"
                    (p. 68), and he comments that "<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> Whiggery's business orientation undoubtedly goes far to explain its poor
                    reception in an overwhelmingly agricultural state" (p. 68). Such observations and many
                    others based on extensive and elaborately documented research make these chapters a valuable essay
                    on the bases of Whig politics.</p>
            <p>A wealth of research and penetrating analysis is evident in this volume. Illuminating remarks made
                    almost casually in the narrative suggest many further avenues for exploration. The book is an
                    outstanding example of the new political history—informed, thoughtful, well organized,
                    and lucidly written. The reviewer hopes that a paperbound edition may be made available so that this
                    volume can be placed more readily in the hands of a wider audience.</p>

            <p>Both the eighteenth century relation of church and state, with its sublimation of individual ideals
                    to a larger social framework, and Moravian missionary zeal contributed to the organization and
                    planning for Moravian colonization. American Moravians trace their name to Moravia—now
                    Czechoslovakia—and their history from John Huss and the Hussite League. Their American
                    missionary efforts began in the West Indies in 1732. An unsuccessful settlement in Savannah, <placeName>

                        1830&#150;1860.</hi> By Marvin Fisher. (<placeName>

            <p>In this brief but lucid book, Fisher joins the ranks of those historians who have recently begun to
                    reassess the significance of American industrial growth in the three decades preceding the Civil
                    War. He believes that the industrial process was firmly established in the United States by 1860,
                    that it had already begun to exert a strong influence on American life, and that it provided
                    opportunities in cities for advancement which rivaled those offered by the frontier. Specifically,
                    Fisher is concerned with the response to these developments by European visitors who came to the
                    United States between 1830 and 1860.</p>
            <p>To most European visitors, the United States appeared as a land of abundance and opportunity. Fisher
                    maintains that their writings reflect a keen perception of the country's agrarian promise
                    ("myth of the garden") as well as its industrial potential ("myth of the
                    workshops"). These seemingly contradictory views actually merge into a new
                    image—"America as potential paradise" (see chapter 3). In describing
                    the new image, foreign observers were generally optimistic and prophetic. They recognized that the
                    American experiment in industrialization was unique and that many of the evils inherent in the
                    European systems could be avoided in the United States. A few critics, most notably Alexis de
                    Tocqueville, predicted that the new technology would have an adverse affect on society, but most
                    visitors revealed their faith in American progress.</p>
            <p>Fisher develops his thesis admirably. He has been selective in choosing his commentators and in
                    dealing with highly subjective evidence. But recognizing these limitations, he believes that
                    European observers have provided not only a "meaningful commentary" on the early
                    industrial development of the United States but also insights into the European's
                    conception of America. Most readers will agree. In using this type of evidence, however, it would
                    seem that footnotes would be of greater value if they had been placed in the text. It is
                    disconcerting to come across a particularly interesting observation and have to turn to the back of
                    the book for the source.</p>
            <p>This book is a significant contribution to the historiography of American cultural history. It will,
                    however, also be of interest to social and economic historians. Particularly valuable is the
                    "Checklist of European Comments on America, 1830-1860."</p>

            <p>A friendly contemporary claimed that "Lovejoy was the real hero of the antislavery
                    cause" (p. x). Edward Magdol, author of this first published examination of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> abolitionist, emphatically agrees. He admits in the <pb n="159" id="VAA4025-064-2-073"/> foreword that he is "frankly partisan," and, indeed, his appraisal is highly
                    favorable; yet this volume, resting solidly on the sources, can properly be judged history rather
                    than special pleading. Historians should welcome this study of a significant but previously
                    neglected figure.</p>
            <p>Even before proslavery men murdered his brother Elijah Lovejoy in 1837, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Owen</region>
                    </placeName> Lovejoy had accepted abolitionism. From that time on, however, antislavery ideas became
                    the passion of his life. Magdol traces the evolution of his tactics from moral suasion, to hazy
                    "immediate emancipation," to direct action in the form of participation in the
                    Underground Railroad (which the author believes was widespread despite a recent skeptical study),
                    and finally to political abolitionism. Lovejoy labored nearly two decades in the antislavery
                    movement before being elected to public office. In 1854 he was elected to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> legislature and in 1856 to the United States House of Representatives, serving there
                    until his death in 1864. Although his name is directly linked with only one act of
                    Congress—the abolition of slavery in the territories of the United States—he
                    was instrumental in gaining the passage of the Homestead Act and in the creation of a bureau of
                    agriculture. A rugged, sanguine activist, Lovejoy was an attractive leader in the struggle for
                    emancipation and civil liberties.</p>
            <p>One of the most interesting aspects of Magdol's study is his discussion of the collaboration
                    and friendship between the radical <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Owen</region>
                    </placeName> Lovejoy and the moderate Abraham <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>. Among the first to recognize the depth of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>'s commitment to antislavery and the need for a united front of antislavery
                    forces, Lovejoy tried to work harmoniously with <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> while struggling to win him to a policy of immediate emancipation. The <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> abolitionist consistently defended <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> before his detractors, and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>, upon hearing that Lovejoy was dying, said, "Lovejoy was the best friend I had
                    in Congress" (p. 403). Magdol suggests that the relationship between Lovejoy and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> casts further doubt on the alleged dichotomy between <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> and the Radicals.</p>
            <p>Ransacking libraries and manuscript collections in many states, Magdol turned up more of the
                    "public, political man" than the private man and has been handicapped in his
                    efforts to describe the wellsprings of Lovejoy's behavior. The author, for instance, does
                    not explain why or how Lovejoy was converted to antislavery. To his credit, however, he has used
                    scanty personal records with insight and skill and has admirably blended character and career.
                    Although the study is on the whole adequately documented, interesting detail is sometimes not
                    supported by the sources. Proof that members of the House of Representatives "set down
                    their pens, put aside papers, and postponed chats" when Lovejoy debated cannot be found in
                    the <hi rend="i">Congressional Globe</hi> (p. 315). Nevertheless, this handsomely prepared political
                    biography is generally well written, well researched, and in this reviewer's opinion well
                    worth reading.</p>

                    </placeName>-Douglas debates of 1858. Relying largely upon contemporary newspaper and manuscript
                    sources, he provides a realistic, well-documented, and sometimes vivid narrative that is
                    sympathetic, even generous, to both contenders. Quoting impartially from Democratic and Republican
                    papers, the author conveys a sense of the bitter partisanship and volatile excitement that
                    prevailed. An aroused Republican editor, for example, described the Little Giant as full of
                    "spleen, verbose nonsense and weak falsification" (p. 127), while his Democratic
                    counterpart called <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> "as queer looking as he is queer spoken" (p. 90). Heckman concludes
                    that Lincoln and Douglas "spoke as if they were trying a case with the audience as
                    jury" (p. 33). Direct quotations from <placeName>

                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> reported after the first debate at <placeName>

                    </placeName>, "crossed swords here yesterday, the fire flew some, and I am glad to know I
                    am yet alive" (p. 86). Reporting the same encounter, Horace Greeley's <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Tribune</hi> claimed that Lincoln "chawed" Douglas up.</p>
            <p>Focusing primarily on slavery and its extension (and, like the candidates, ignoring other relevant
                    political and economic motivations), Heckman analyzes the arguments presented, cites the opinions of
                    conflicting scholars, and takes a firm position when he feels that the evidence warrants a
                    conclusion. He labels as "a gross exaggeration" <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>'s "implications that Franklin Pierce, James Buchanan, Roger B. Taney,
                    and Douglas" were "a part of a conspiracy to make slavery a national
                    institution" (p. 85). He disagrees with the view that Lincoln "risked
                    defeat" in 1858 in order "to force Douglas into a position unacceptable to the
                    Southern wing of the Democratic party." This is, Heckman says, "a fairy story
                    which attributes to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> 'fortune telling' powers he did not possess." Heckman
                    consequently discounts the legend that Lincoln told Joseph Medill, <hi rend="i">"I am
                        killing larger game.</hi> The battle of 1860 is worth a hundred of this" (pp. 92-93).</p>
            <p>Heckman makes little effort to analyze the influence of the debating upon the voting. Nor does he
                    cite the study of Forest L. Whan, who, after an analysis of election statistics, suggests that
                    Lincoln fared better in those counties where he did not speak. Modern procedures make studies of
                    shift of voter opinion feasible and should prompt the author to pursue further research on this
                    ultimate question of the 1858 canvass.</p>
            <p>The Public Affairs Press should be applauded for issuing this study, as well as for publishing an
                    impressive series of monographs on American political campaigning. The editors should be encouraged,
                    however, to provide better copy reading, larger type, and a more attractive format than they
                    provided in this volume.</p>

            <p>At a time when educational change is the order of the day, it is refreshing and informative to read
                    what some educators were saying about education and its problems nearly one hundred years ago. <hi rend="i">An Early View of the Land-<placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> in August, 1871. It was the first time that representatives of the new land-grant
                    colleges met together to discuss their individual and mutual problems. There were twenty-nine
                    presidents and professors of agricultural colleges and friends of agriculture at the convention. A
                    representative of the <hi rend="i">

            <p>The formal papers and general discussions centered around a number of problems of current importance.
                    These included the place of teaching and research in higher education, the admission of women, the
                    role of experiment stations, the question of students working for the colleges, student
                    responsibility for their own government, and continued relations among agricultural educators. Two
                    of the main problems under consideration—the emphasis upon teaching and research and
                    student self-government on the campus—sound as revelant in 1968 as they did in 1871. This
                    book is mainly useful because it gives something of the educational flavor of the times and outlines
                    some of the challenges facing educators in the years right after the Civil War. It is a valuable
                    contemporary document for the history of both agricultural and general education.</p>

               <hi rend="i">The Papers of Woodrow Wilson</hi>. Volume III, <hi rend="i">1884&#150;1885</hi>.

            <p>In this, the third of some forty projected volumes of <hi rend="i">The Papers of Woodrow Wilson</hi>,
                    students of the twenty-eighth president's career will discover much that is new and
                    enlightening, some that is familiar. Common to all the more than four hundred items, however, is the
                    human dimension they give to an estimate of Woodrow Wilson. The conventional Wilson is an austere,
                    cold person, a lonely figure who in one acquaintance's judgment could love humanity but not
                    men. But from the letters in this book there emerges a new Wilson, "My darling
                    Woodrow," a man of warmth and intensely human qualities. Flesh, blood, and emotion have
                    been added to the bony features, the morning coat, and the erect posture.</p>
            <p>The chief source of this new dimension, as well as the unique contribution of this volume, is the
                    collection of intimate letters between Wilson and his <pb n="162" id="VAA4025-064-2-076"/>
                    fiancée, Ellen Louise Axson. Some of this correspondence was published several years ago,
                    but here it appears in its rich, romantic entirety. These letters dominate the volume; their
                    frequency and candor record not only the sentiments of two lovers but also the daily routine of
                    their separate lives.</p>
            <p>Covering the period from February, 1884, to January, 1885, Volume III reveals Wilson during an
                    interesting and important year in his career. Much of the correspondence centers on his studies,
                    impressions, and professional aspirations as a graduate student at Johns Hopkins University. There
                    are shorthand lecture notes, minutes taken at meetings of the famous seminar conducted by Herbert
                    Baxter <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Adams</region>
                    </placeName>, and comments on professors like Richard T. Ely. An interesting topic for comparison by
                    today's graduate students is Wilson's correspondence about securing his first
                    professional position. This includes his exploration of possible openings at the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="aru">Arkansas</region>
                    </placeName> Industrial University and his salary negotiations with Bryn Mawr. Certain other
                    features of these years indicate both change and continuity in the historical profession since 1884:
                    the $500 fellowship at Johns Hopkins and the $1,200 salary offer from Bryn
                    Mawr; Wilson's complaint about "the school-boy task of cramming" (p. 379)
                    for Ph.D. examinations.</p>
            <p>Readers will be interested to see the genesis of <hi rend="i">Congressional Government</hi> in the
                    minutes of seminar meetings and in Wilson's correspondence with Houghton, Mifflin and
                    Company. They will follow the rumors of imminent revolution during the 1884 presidential campaign.
                    They will enjoy a seminar debate between Wilson and John Dewey on the subject of federal aid to
                    common school education. The future president made "a strenuous argument" (p. 136)
                    against it on constitutional grounds.</p>
            <p>These and other delights make this a fascinating volume which illuminates the life of Woodrow Wilson
                    as no biography can. It reveals the wellsprings of his ambition and energy, the close ties with his
                    father, and the "priceless gift" of his relationship with Ellen. It delights the
                    reader with handsome typography, interesting cross-references and annotations, a useful table of
                    contents, and a superior index.</p>

            <p>Ronald Stinnett has performed a very useful service in composing this fact-filled book on Democratic
                    party dinners and the dollars their sponsors have raised for party support. Through the years to
                    come, historians should be grateful to him for bringing together so many once-fugitive
                    details—and <pb n="163" id="VAA4025-064-2-077"/> almost as grateful to the <placeName>

                    </placeName> State University Press for publishing such a handsome volume.</p>
            <p>In part the author has concentrated, quite properly, on the dinners themselves—their cost,
                    the edibles and potables served, special themes or emphases, and the funds flowing to party coffers
                    or creditors. The other major emphasis is on the speeches, particularly those of Presidents and
                    White House hopefuls. Welcome to the reviewer was the fresh opportunity to compare Franklin D.
                    Roosevelt's suave and at times almost nonpartisan approach with the more obviously
                    partisan, and therefore more conventional, efforts of some other headliners. From the standpoint of
                    things-then-to-come, accounts of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jackson</region>
                    </placeName> Day Dinners of 1912, 1932, and 1960 are unusually absorbing. There are also capsules of
                    $100-a-plate dinner speeches from 1936 through 1966; selected menus, including one for a
                    repast planned on a 700-calorie basis; photographs, cartoons, and other illustrations.</p>
            <p>Stinnett is both a devoted Democrat and the recipient of the M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from the
                    University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName>. He serves as assistant to Vice President Hubert Humphrey, who contributed the foreword
                    and whom Stinnett describes in the dedication as "My Mentor, My Friend, My
                    Inspiration." It should be no surprise, therefore, that regarding his subject the author is
                    decidedly empathic. Yet a great deal of first-rate scholarship, as well as enthusiasm, is
                    represented in this work. The bibliography is impressive; twenty-three theses and dissertations are
                    listed. Stinnett not only culled newspapers, magazines, and books but personally interviewed
                    numerous officials. His discussions, in the notes, of party methods and party development are
                    particularly discerning in this reviewer's judgment. Indeed, in the long run, they may
                    prove more valuable than some of the text itself.</p>
            <p>Many American citizens, undertaking to introduce people from abroad to our way of life, have found it
                    especially difficult successfully to interpret political parties to foreigners. An Eastland and a
                    Humphrey in the Democracy? A Goldwater and a Javits in the G.O.P.? "Mais, monsieur, how can
                    such things be?" The Stinnett volume goes far in the direction of accounting for the cement
                    holding parties together after a fashion year after year, despite the often disparate nature of
                    those parties' human and ideological ingredients.</p>

            <p>The story has it that a congressman, when asked about his participation in a conservative coalition
                    of southern Democrats and Republicans, replied: <pb n="164" id="VAA4025-064-2-078"/>
                    "Sometimes I coalesce. Sometimes I don't." While historians have known in
                    a general way that a congressional coalition formed during <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> Roosevelt's presidency has blocked liberal programs from the Fair Deal to the
                    Great Society, they have lacked a full-scale account of its origins. Now James Patterson offers such
                    a study. He attempts to explain who the congressional conservatives were, what common
                    characteristics they shared, when they formed a coalition, and how effective their opposition to the
                    New Deal was.</p>
            <p>Patterson proceeds by describing the New Deal proposals that called forth opposition, the arguments
                    used against these measures, the strategy of the administration and its opponents, the reasons for
                    enactment or defeat, and the significance of all this for conservative unity. More than
                    three-fourths of the book is devoted to the years 1937-1939, and much more attention is given the
                    Senate than the House. Patterson's account is based on broad research in manuscript
                    sources, his presentation is clear and direct, and his judgments are usually sound. As a result,
                    this is an excellent acount of the reasons why various members of Congress opposed certain measures
                    sponsored by the Roosevelt administration.</p>
            <p>Although a few Democrats disliked the New Deal from the start and there was significant opposition to
                    the regulation of public utilities in 1935, Patterson believes that broad congressional hostility to
                    the New Deal did not develop until after 1937. Roosevelt's proposal to enlarge the Supreme
                    Court, his failure to combat the recession, and his attempt to purge the Democratic party led to an
                    erosion of his strength. At the same time, the administration's attempt to aid the urban
                    working classes offended many senators and representatives with rural constituencies. Patterson,
                    however, admits that an effective bipartisan coalition did not emerge during the 1930's. He
                    shows that opponents of the administration varied from issue to issue, that the 1938 session
                    "in no sense exposed a well-organized, monolithic conservative coalition," and
                    that even in 1939 "the bipartisan coalition failed to function at all" (p. 247,
                    31) in many cases.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, the criteria the author adopts for evaluating "conservatism" are
                    exceedingly arbitrary. He presumes that any vote against Roosevelt's proposals was by
                    definition "conservative," although this was not always the case. Moreover, he
                    considers any Democratic representative "conservative" if he voted against the
                    administration on at least 25 percent of certain key roll calls; he considers any Democratic senator
                    "conservative" if he cast at least 12 percent of his votes against the
                    administration. The choice of these percentages is not explained; indeed, had the author used a
                    slightly higher percentage very few congressmen would have qualified as
                    "conservatives." But then, perhaps one might suggest that the formation of the
                    conservative coalition occurred during the war years rather than the 1930's.</p>

                    </placeName> scholar has now emerged as the historian of the recent South nonpareil. He has written
                    a model regional history, an extraordinarily impressive interpretation of the South's
                    experience during the years 1913-1945, a volume that is imaginatively conceived, gracefully written,
                    and based upon exhaustive research.</p>
            <p>The book is skillfully organized on the basic of twenty comprehensive and informative chapters. It
                    begins, appropriately, with politics—a discussion of the South's influential
                    role in the Wilson administration, a characterization of the progressive movement below the Potomac,
                    and an analysis of political affairs in the individual southern states. Successive chapters then
                    deal with the impact of World War I, industrial development in the 1920's, the recurrent
                    agricultural crisis, Negroes and race relations, social currents and the image of the benighted
                    South, politics in the twenties, the emergence of public services, the literary revival, and the
                    ordeal of southern labor. A chapter on the Great Depression provides a transition to the second
                    major part of the book and marks the accelerating pace of regional change. In the chapters that
                    follow the author examines the New Deal and southern agriculture, the regional economy in the
                    1930's, relief, welfare, and education, the growth of labor unions, the Negro's
                    status, regionalism and sectionalism as views of southern life, politics and the New Deal,
                    literature in the thirties and forties, and the South during World War II. A splendid
                    bibliographical essay rounds out the work.</p>
            <p>Tindall has produced a balanced account of political, economic, intellectual, and cultural
                    developments. He has not neglected the region's internal affairs or the existential
                    character of southern history during this period, but he has tried throughout to show the effect of
                    outside forces on the South as well as the section's essential role in the nation. He has,
                    in fact, surmounted the problem of writing a broadly conceived regional history in the absence of a
                    clearly defined spatial entity or institutional focus. At the same time, he does not exaggerate the
                    uniformity of the regional culture; he has a sharp eye for subregional, state, and local variations.</p>
            <pb n="166" id="VAA4025-064-2-080"/>
            <p>Nor is this static history. It is alive and moving over time. If the analysis of certain aspects of
                    the southern experience could be extended, this weakness is attributable in large part to the
                    ambitious scope of the design and to the absence of scholarly work in some areas, particularly by
                    historians. Tindall views this eventful period in recent southern history as one possessing a good
                    deal of unity. But he advances no insistent interpretation in his portrait of the period, aside from
                    numerous themes of regional emergence and the Southerner's growing consciousness of change.
                    The South did change in many ways between 1913 and 1945, but the change was intermixed with
                    reaction, and at the end of the era the region remained more than ever an American paradox. The way
                    in which that paradox evolved during this momentous period is the burden of this illuminating
                    history.</p>

            <p>These three volumes are abridgements of much longer studies which appeared during the nineteenth
                    century. Recent scholarship has modified the presentation and conclusions of these classical
                    accounts, but they yet have much worth. They represent a period in which historical writing had not
                    become segregated from the mainstream of literature. All three volumes are well worth reading,

                    pamphlets. Articles, dissertations and theses, and manuscript material have not been included. The
                    bibliography presented here should be useful to general readers, Civil War buffs, and scholars
                    alike. Moreover, though it will doubtless attract less popular attention than did battlefield
                    re-enactments during the Civil War Centennial observance, it is decidedly in better taste and more
                    appropriate than were such re-enactments.</p>

                    Pp. x, 479. Bibliography, suggested readings, notes.) As the sub-title indicates, this is a book of
                    interpretative essays concerning the Civil War and Reconstruction era. The emphasis is more on
                    recent than on earlier interpretations and, as frankly indicated by Editor Crowe in the Preface, <pb n="170" id="VAA4025-064-2-084"/> the volume reflects "the interplay of present
                    sensibilities and past events…." In fact, it is quite possible that such
                    emphasis has been overplayed.</p>

                    Bessie M. Lindsey. (Rutland, Vt.: Charles E. Tuttle Co., Publishers, 1967. Pp. xxviii, 541.
                    Illustrations, index. $10.00.) Many and varied books have been written about people,
                    places, and events in American history; but few, if any, are like this work by Bessie M. Lindsey.
                        <hi rend="i">American Historical Glass</hi> traces the history of the United States in an
                    unusual way: by following the glassware which has been produced to commemorate the
                    country's famous people, places, and happenings. The book will be interesting to students
                    of American history, but its primary contribution will be to those persons interested in American
                    glassware. The work is filled not only with descriptions of the commemorative pieces but also with
                    hundreds of black and white photographic reproductions of many of them. Hence it is an invaluable
                    reference book for the collector. <hi rend="i">C. <placeName>
