                    written materials on the contract are relatively sparse, Fishbaugh chose not to describe how the

                    attesting to the national and international importance of the Howard yards and also provides a

                    7% Able to Earn a Livelihood." All the items were not so gloomy, however. On
                    February 5 the same paper ran a piece about the many railroads that were being projected for Alaska,
                    an indication that the population there would be permanent. Of greater interest to the Howards must
                    have been the assertion two days later: "Even at this early day the full capacity of every
                    steam and sailing ship on the Pacific Coast is… [strained] to its utmost capacity to

        <p>Despite this excitement, the Howards appear to have been reluctant to participate in the flurry of
                    business activity associated with the Alaska gold rush. According to Mrs. Loretta Howard, widow of
                    the last owner of the Howard Shipyards, her father-in-law, Edmunds J. Howard was so flooded with
                    work in late 1897 that he submitted an outrageously high bid to build the four boats desired for the
                    Klondike trade by the Alaska Commercial Company: "Mr. Ed Howard quoted a price three times
                    as much as it should have been, thinking this would drive those Alaska people away. It
                    din't. They had to have those boats to take care of that Gold rush traffic. When they
                    accepted the price, we had to go ahead and fill our part of the bargain.'"<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
        </p>

        <p>A letter to Gustave Hunt of the Alaska firm dated November 29, 1897, documents the contract. In it
                    the Howards proposed specifications for three passenger sternwheelers each 225 feet long with a 40
                    foot beam and a 6 foot hold and for a tow boat 165 feet long with a 36 foot beam and a 5 foot hold.
                    A note added at the bottom of the sheet states: "Accepted [by] Alaska Commercial

          </placeName>, boiler and sheet iron works, sent the Howards specifications for machinery for two
                    sternwheel boats for the Yukon River.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> By February, 1898, Captain A. M. Hunt had
                    arrived in <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
          </placeName> to discuss the plans with E. J. Howard. According to a <hi rend="i">Courier-Journal</hi> story of February 7, 1898, the building material was to be shipped to <placeName>

        <p>One of the carpenters, Stapleton Densford, lived until 1971. The writer had the privilege of
                    interviewing him in late 1968 when the alert and talkative Densford was ninety-nine years old.
                    According to Densford, the party left Jeffer-sonville by train and went to <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">San Francisco</settlement>
          </placeName>. There they boarded a ship which stopped at <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Portland</settlement>, <region reg="oru" type="state">Oregon</region>

          </placeName>, for lumber
                    and food. Densford said the camp was located at the town of Dutch Harbor, on the northeast side of
                    Unalaska Island.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>

        <p>One of the few sources of diversion available to the men was sourdough whiskey. Densford remembered
                    that it had cost three dollars a half pint and that they had to "walk four miles across a
                    mountain to get it." The men worked outside as they did in <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>

          </placeName> and on many a morning had to sweep piles of snow from the four long hulls they were
                    putting together before starting work. Densford, who was a planker and also a glazier, was
                    responsible for installing all the glass on the four boats. He trained an eskimo as a helper, and
                    the man became "mighty good at his job." While on Unalaska, Densford caught
                    diptheria and the doctor on the expedition wanted to send him home, but the hardy carpenter
                    preferred to stay on.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>

        <p>Another part of the expedition left toward the end of March, 1898. This party of engineers was

        <p>Schaaf's party had arrived on Unalaska by April 24, when George Curry, one of the engineers,
                    wrote home that the temperature at the camp was zero degrees, "yet they considered this
                    good weather, and all were at work in the open air." The task of setting up the four boats
                    was progressing rapidly, and Curry judged they would probably be ready by June 15 to begin their
                    runs "up and down the Yukon and into the <geogName>Klondike rivers</geogName>, a distance
                    of over 1,800 miles." The vessels were made of pine, he said, so that they would be as
                    light as possible, drawing only five feet of water when fully loaded, and Curry put them in the same
                    class with the "Tell City," a packet which operated between <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
          </placeName> and Henderson, <placeName>
            <region reg="kyu" type="state">Kentucky</region>

          </placeName>. Curry reported that the gold diggings were reputed to be very rich, and he announced
                    his plans to go up the Yukon himself to investigate. If he found "gold digging pays better
                    than steamboating" he would "remain in the mines and try his hand."

        <p>The existing financial data on the Alaskan expedition must be only partial. In the Howard
                    correspondence for 1898-1899, there exists only one bill to the Alaska Commercial Company for work
                    which included drafting "plans and specifications, furnishing [a] model [.] frame parts,
                    stem &amp; transoms [,] outriggers … rudders, Hogchains, cabin doors and sash
                    … for four (4) steamers[.]" The company was also charged for two carloads of oak
                    lumber in the rough to make a total due of $35,470.49.<hi
            rend="sup">19</hi> Fishbaugh
                    lists the cost of the boats as $25,000 for each of the three larger ones and
                    $12,000 for the towboat.<hi

        <p>William Hendricks, though unknown to most modern Hoosiers, played a prominent role in the later years
                    of Indiana territorial history and the early decades of statehood. His career in public office
                    spanned the period from 1813, when he became clerk of the territorial House of Representatives, to
                    1837, when congressional adjournment marked the end of his tenure as <placeName>
            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
          </placeName> senator.</p>
        <p>Hendricks' service in Congress—in the House from 1816 to 1822 and in the Senate
                    from 1825 to 1837—occurred at a time when it was difficult for western congressmen to
                    keep in touch with their constituents. Because travel by horseback, riverboat, or carriage was slow,
                    they could not visit their home districts during a session of Congress. With sessions lasting from
                    three to six months, they could not be in their districts more than six to nine months each year.
                    Long distance communication also was difficult because without the telephone, the telegraph, or
                    electronic media, messages could be transmitted no faster than a person could travel. Hendricks and
                    other representatives engaged in voluminous correspondence, but few of the people they represented
                    could have been reached by individual letters. One effective and widely used device for keeping
                    constituents informed was the political circular.</p>

        <p>During the eighteen years that Hendricks represented the people of Indiana in Congress, he wrote
                    political circulars to his constituents annually. He usually wrote them about the time Congress
                    adjourned, and they were widely distributed <list type="footnotes">

                    correspondence. Most of them reported the status of legislation with which his constituents were
                    vitally concerned and disclosed his views on matters of public interest. If his term was soon to
                    expire, the circular, reviewing past accomplishments, might resemble a campaign document.</p>

        <p>As a record of one western congressman's thoughts and actions, Hendricks' circular
                    letters are an important historical resource, and eight of them were published by the Indiana

        <p>Congressman Hendricks' popularity continued to increase, and in 1822 he was elected governor
                    of Indiana without opposition. In January 1825, and again in December 1830, the Indiana General
                    Assembly elected him <placeName>

        <p>In 1836 Hendricks was defeated in his bid for an unprecedented third six year term as senator from
                    Indiana, but he did not retire from politics. He would have welcomed election to the Senate in 1838
                    or 1843; and he actively sought appointment as federal district judge for Indiana in 1842 and
                    election as president of the Second State Bank of Indiana in 1843.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>

        <p>Hendricks' entry into politics had coincided with the demise of the Federalist party. His
                    early years in high office, therefore, were during a period of "non-party"
                    politics at both state and national levels. Even when the "era of good feeling"
                    ended in the 1820s, he sought to avoid identification with either of the emerging national parties.

        <p>Few politicians have surpassed Congressman Hendricks in careful attention to the needs and desires of

                    lived in the southernmost counties. The 1820 census revealed a population of 147,178, eighty-four

                    Because he practiced politics as the art of doing what was possible and was willing to compromise,
                    he doubtless voted for many bills with which he was not wholly satisfied.</p>
        <p>In the wide variety of national issues discussed in his annual circulars, Hendricks treated certain
                    questions more thoroughly than others. In particular Hendricks reported often on the progress of
                    claims filed against the national government by Indiana militiamen for payment of their service
                    during the War of 1812, the admission of <placeName>

            <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
          </placeName> over territorial boundaries, and the modification of the public land policy.</p>
        <p>Hendricks' first circular is unique. Written after his reelection in August 1817, it was
                    devoted to explaining and defending his motives and actions as congressman and to discrediting those
                    who had sought his defeat. In Indiana, where most men thought of themselves as Jeffersonian
                    Republicans, political alignments were conditioned by personal affinities and animosities and by a
                    sectionalism that had carried over from the territorial period and tended to pit the more populous
                    eastern counties against the western counties. The dominant eastern faction was led by Governor

                    address his supporters with confidence and approach his detractors with condescension. Perhaps the
                    most effective defense in the entire circular was Hendricks' concluding admission that he
                    had "no 'vested right to represent the people of Indiana' other than what

        <p>The militiamen's payment controversy concerned members of sixteen companies of Indiana

                    substantiating claims, lack of adequate funds at the disposal of the secretary of war, and the

                    When revolutions broke out from Mexico to the Argentine during the first quarter of the nineteenth

          </placeName> to remain aloof, withholding even diplomatic recognition; others wanted not only

                    also frightened the Spanish. After appropriate formal protests, Onis settled down to serious

                    obvious that the four year credit system, as established by the Harrison Land Law of 1800 and
                    amended in 1804, was not working well. Both speculators and settlers found it difficult and
                    sometimes impossible to make their scheduled payments. Some speculators had simply bought too much
                    land. Many settlers had discovered the statutory minimum of 160 acres to be more than they could use
                    or pay for within four years at the minimum price of two dollars per acre, especially after the
                    Panic of 1819. Despite passage of a series of relief laws, starting in 1806, to protect the buyer
                    who did not make his payments, by the end of 1820 the outstanding debt on land purchases totalled
                    some $21,000,000 with more than $2,000,000 owed in Indiana alone.<hi rend="sup">38</hi> Moreover, there already had been extensive forfeiture because relief laws
                    were neither uniform nor comprehensive.</p>

        <p>To halt the increase of landed indebtedness and default, Congress abolished the credit system in
                    1820. The new minimum purchase tract was eighty acres, and the minimum cash price was
                    $1.25 per acre.<hi
            rend="sup">39</hi> Hendricks opposed the abolition of credit land
                    sales, and the only redeeming feature he saw in this bill was the low price. This, he believed,
                    would make it possible for all classes to purchase land and would make the government "more
                    inclined to indulge those who are at present indebted, and who are unable to pay for their

                    made to what he retained. He could pay his debt at 371/2 percent discount, which in effect reduced
                    his purchase price to the current minimum of $1.25 per acre. Or he could obtain an

            <region reg="mdu" type="state">Maryland</region>
          </placeName>, to the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> at Wheeling in 1818; a canal to bypass the

                    construction of roads within the state. In the Indiana Enabling Act Congress had shown its interest
                    in aiding Indiana transportation and development. In this act, the federal government had agreed to
                    spend two percent of the net proceeds from land sales in the state to build roads to the state, and
                    to transfer to the General Assembly three percent of the net proceeds to build roads and canals in
                    the state. Among other provisions of the act, the state relinquished for five years from the date of
                    sale the right to tax any land passing into private hands after December 1, 1816, and the right to
                    tax public lands.<hi rend="sup">42</hi>

        <p>When Indiana entered the Union in 1816, the Indians still possessed most of the northern two thirds
                    of the state, and immediate prospects for the state's growth and development were not good.
                    Hendricks, therefore, worked hard for early extinction of Indian land titles, rapid survey of newly
                    acquired lands, and the establishment of more land offices. The most spectacular development was the
                    New Purchase negotiated at St. Marys, <placeName>
            <region reg="ohu" type="state">Ohio</region>
          </placeName>, in 1818. It was the largest single purchase ever made in Indiana and embraced most of

        <p>In 1811 Congress had refused to recharter the First <placeName>
            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
          </placeName> Bank. The experience of struggling through the War of 1812 without the benefit of
                    central banking, however, had caused many national leaders to change their minds about the wisdom
                    and constitutionality of a national bank. So in the spring of 1816 Congress chartered the Second
                    Bank of the <placeName>
            <country reg="-us">United States</country>

          </placeName>, which was to act as the government's fiscal agent and establish and maintain
                    a stable and uniform currency. Less than a year after the bank opened its doors in January, 1817,
                    the House Committee on National Currency investigated its operation.<hi
            rend="sup">44</hi> Though
                    the House took no action against the bank at that time, Hendricks described the committee's
                    report as "an <hi
            rend="i">expose</hi> of a series of improprieties on the part of the
                    directors, not perhaps equalled in the history of any other moneyed institution."<hi rend="sup">45</hi>
        </p>

        <p>Following the War of 1812, the army was reduced to less than 10,000 men stationed on the seaboard,
                    along the northern frontier, and in the West. After the Panic of 1819, Hendricks and others favored
                    further reduction of the armed forces.<hi rend="sup">46</hi> Congress spent more time, however, on
                    the problem of benefits for needy veterans and for widows and orphans of veterans. A Revolutionary
                    pension law was enacted providing old or indigent veterans of that war a small income for life.
                    Congress also extended for five years the half-pay status of widows and orphans of militiamen killed
                    in the War of 1812, including the Battle of <placeName>
            <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>

          </placeName>. These statutes were important for the people of Indiana because numerous veterans of
                    the War for Independence had migrated there and because the Indiana militia had often borne the
                    brunt of Indian attacks on the frontier during the War of 1812.<hi rend="sup">47</hi>

            <country reg="-us">United States</country>

          </placeName> from the world market, had encouraged the development of industry-When the war ended
                    and trade was resumed, some domestic manufactured products could not successfully compete with
                    imported goods, and the manufacturers turned to the government for aid. In 1816 Congress enacted the
                    first avowedly protective tariff, and twice while Hendricks, who seems to have been a moderate
                    protectionist, was in the House, tariff rates were raised despite the opposition of southern
                    planters and some northern merchants.<hi rend="sup">48</hi>

        <p>Immediately following the War of 1812, the American economy had over expanded to fill the demand
                    created for goods as a result of the disruption of Europe's economy by the French
                    Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars that had been going on intermittently since 1789. But within a
                    few years after hostilities ended in Europe, the productive system there rebounded, and the demand
                    for American goods declined sharply. Land values plummetted, and the price of staples fell;
                    depression was evident in every section of the country.<hi
            rend="sup">49</hi> In Indiana public land
                    sales declined and immigration dwindled. With local surpluses of agricultural commodities and
                    declining prices, many settlers could not meet their financial obligations.'<hi

        <p>Perusal of Hendricks' annual circulars reveals his diligence in reporting to his
                    constituents and the breadth of his concerns and theirs. His position on each issue is usually
                    clear, and he did not hesitate to take credit for his accomplishments on behalf of the people of
                    Indiana.</p>

                    already on the threshold of Congress, already your representative, usurped your name and authority,
                    and called upon me to answer certain interrogatories which he himself had set forth.</p>

                    editors would accept the appointment, to the Gazette whose editors were applicants? every
                    man of common sense will say no. But why did not the editors of the Herald inform Mr. Noble and
                    myself, if they wished to obtain that appointment. Perhaps, indeed those gentlemen thought it
                    stooping beneath their dignity to address a line to either of us. Would not the editors of the
                    Gazette have had the same reasons to complain, if their application had not been
                    preferred? what exclusive right or privilege will common understanding or justice give
                    the Herald over the Gazette? on what could such right or privilege be founded?
                    or how let me ask can the Herald be effected or "ruined" by the appointment of the
                    Gazette? can that be taken away which was never given or enjoyed?</p>

        <p>Another very serious charge as easily understood as it is false, &amp; emphatically stated by the
                    Herald, is, that I endeavored to have the printing of the U.S. laws taken away from Mr. Stout/<hi
            rend="sup">1</hi> The object of this cannot be mistaken. It was intended to impress the citizens
                    of the <hi rend="i">West [em</hi> counties] with an idea that I had attempted to deprive them of
                    every means of promulgating the laws of the U.S. among them. It was intended to fan the flame of
                    local jealousy already in existence in the West, and to make that feeling heretofore and still
                    prevalent at <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>

          </placeName> coincident with the whole western end of the state. It was intended to marshall the
                    feelings of the East and West against each other, that this same editor [Nelson], whose pretensions
                    had not yet become generally known or repsected [<hi
            rend="i">sic</hi>], might have to a <hi rend="i">party</hi>, and be taken up generally in the <hi
            rend="i">west.</hi> If Mr. Noble and
                    myself endeavored to have Mr. Stout removed from that appointment, who else did we
                    nominate? No one. There is in this assertion gross and malignant falsehood. I stated
                    unequivocally, that there was no other newspaper in the west to be selected, and that it was proper
                    and right to have the laws printed in that section of the state. It was my opinion <list type="footnotes">

            n="314"/> also, that a greater number of papers in each state would be
                    employed in printing the laws: But when giving an opinion of Mr. Stout as an editor, I did also
                    state, that he had the reputation of an indolent man—that in his <hi
            rend="i">publications</hi> he had not formerly been very punctual—that his <hi
            rend="i">"Sun"</hi> had frequently set for more than a week at a time, and that in
                    consequence of this, the publication of the laws in that quarter was frequently retarded.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> But I did not state that Mr. Stout while he received the emoluments of the
                    General Government for publishing their laws, permitted his paper to be made a vehicle of slander
                    and abuse against that government. I did not state that Mr. Stout received and published
                    communications abusive of that government to whose protection he was indebted for the enjoyments of
                    his fireside, &amp; the frontiers of Indiana for their habitations. These traits of Mr. Stout as
                    an editor I might have given, and subsequent publications would have proved my assertions true.</p>

        <p>Another charge of a most singular nature is, that I was "cognizant of and instrumental in
                    bringing the Gazette to Corydon." The editors of the Gazette have already stated enough on
                    this subject, but all will not do. Mr. Brandon I never saw till April last—Mr. James
                    Lodge I have never yet seen, nor had I the remotest knowledge of their establishment [of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Gazette</hi>] till after I left home last November for <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
          </placeName>.</p>

        <p>I have been charged with procuring for Mr. Brandon the appointment of Post Master at Corydon. This
                    appointment has rung through the state, and been reiterated in almost every number of the Herald for
                    three months past. The recommendation of Mr. [Richard M.] Heth [the retiring postmaster,] was
                    disregarded. This is the thing so much complained of. On this subject however I might have plead
                    ignorance, for I never before knew that Mr. Heth had a right to nominate his successor. This would
                    be policy and proceeding of a very dignified order indeed. The circumstance of Mr. Heth's
                    letter, without any other recommendation for Mr. [Giliis] M'Bean, casts a shade of
                    suspicion on <list type="footnotes">

                    thing was fair &amp; correct—if the people of Corydon knew that Mr. Heth was about to
                    decline, why did not at least some of the citizens sign Mr M'Bean's nomination.
                    The history of that affair at <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>

          </placeName>, is as follows. Early in the session Mr. Heth forwarded a letter to the Postmaster
                    General [Return Jonathan Meigs], in which he stated his resignation—named Mr
                    M'Bean as his succesor [<hi
            rend="i">sic</hi>] in office, and proposed transferring the
                    papers as soon as he (M'Bean) should be authorized to receive them.—This letter
                    was by the P. M. General immediately enclosed to me, as the Representative of the people. My opinion
                    was asked respecting the appointment of M'Bean, and a request was added that I should
                    signify my approbation, or nominate some fit person to be appointed. On reading the letter of Mr.
                    Heth, it struck me as a thing very probable, that the citizens of Corydon had not been notified of
                    the resignation of Mr. Heth, or the nomination of Mr. M'Bean, or they would either have
                    joined with Mr. Heth in recommending M'Bean, or nominated another person. Without
                    therefore, having any hostility toward M'Bean, or preference for any particular person, I
                    determined on waiting the arrival of some mails, before I would answer the letter aforesaid;
                    thinking I might receive something from Corydon on the subject, and an expression of the citizens in
                    favor of some applicant for the appointment.—By the arrival of the second mail, I
                    received letters informing me of the resignation of Mr. Heth, and that Mr. Brandon was an
                    applicants—that he was well recommended, and that his recommendation was before the P.
                    Master General. I enquired if this recommendation had arrived, and was answered in the affirmative.
                    This was enough for me. I did not ask to see it. There was no recommendation for any other person
                    save the official one of Mr. Heth. I acquiesced in the nomination of Mr. Brandon, and so would I
                    have done, had the nomination been in favor of Mr. M'Bean, or Mr. any body else. Of Mr.
                    Brandon at that time I had just heard, had never seen him. He had not written to me on that or any
                    other subject, but being acquainted with Col. Johnson,<hi
            rend="sup">7</hi> had written to him. I
                    had no partiality in his favor. This thing however has answered certain gentry to noise through the

                    and Hendricks put in their counter application without consulting Mr. [Senator Waller] Taylor, to
                    whom the interests and feelings of this town and county had been entrusted in this affair."
                    And who entrusted Mr. Taylor with the feelings of both town and county in this affair?
                    Perhaps indeed Mr. Heth, whose recommendation ought to have outweighed all others. I strongly
                    suspect that Mr. Taylor was not entrusted or advised on the occasion, and if he had been, the
                    friends of M'Bean ought not to complain, that Mr. Noble and myself did not consult Mr. T.
                    because he did not consult us. Nor do I believe Mr. Taylor made any effort, to have M'Bean
                    appointed, unrecom-mended as he was, over Mr. Brandon who was well recommended. If such was the
                    conduct of Mr. Taylor, such would not be mine. In fine, I have no doubt, that if through my
                    attention, the editors of the "Herald," had been appointed printers of the laws of
                    the Union,—any other person than an editor of the "Gazette," appointed
                    post master at Corydon, and one of the editors of the Herald appointed District Attorney for the
                    state, that all would have been well—that for attentions like these, I could have
                    commanded the talents, the labors and zeal of these editors, in the same degree they have been
                    employed against me.</p>

        <p>Fellow-citizens, it has been my lot ever since I appeared on the political theatre, to receive the
                    scurrilous abuses of some editors and others, who are in the habit of denouncing every officer and
                    candidate for office, who has not been brought forward by themselves. When a candidate for your
                    suffrages last year, though I had not announced my name or pretensions through the medium of any
                    press, the Western Sun was good enough to notice me as altogether "undeserving" of
                    "notice;" and to employ some pleasant epithets, very usual for that paper, when
                    noticing candidates for office, which they are not disposed to support. Notwithstanding that notice,
                    the Western Sun has since thought proper to employ its columns for months past in noticing
                    me—in pouring on me the most scurrilous and undeserved abuse,<hi

                    Graham] on the subject of the claims of the militia. The recognition of the Secretary of War of the
                    claims of the militia of Indiana, was obtained by the repeated solicitations of Mr. [Jonathan]
                    Jennings while [a territorial] delegate in Congress. That business was fixed and determined before I

                    credit of having done my duty. In vain will the writer under the specious garb of "Justice
                    and Truth," or any other writer, state, that exertion on their behalf tended to promote
                    delay in the reception of their pay. It need not be told the militiaman or the ranger, that Major
                    Whitlock'' has been most friendly to their claims, and would but for the want of
                    funds long ere now have paid thern.— Major Whitlock himself will not say so. He will say
                    for he has said, that many of the rangers had long ago received more from the government than they
                    justly deserved. This he has said respecting Capt. [Frederick] Sholts' company of rangers,
                    who have lately received a balance of their pay, in consequence of a special order from the
                    Paymaster General. It was pay rolls in due form and properly authenticated, which Major W. looked
                    to, and not to the justice of their claims from having performed services. He was no military
                    chancellor. If the militia and rangers or any of them have received their pay, I shall not regret
                    any exertion on their behalf, notwithstanding the abuse of the Western Sun. That some and a goodly
                    number have been paid I know. That some have not been paid I also know, and it is a subject to which
                    I shall, during the next session of congress devote every attention. While any thing remains in my
                    power on that subject, either as a public man or private citizen, I will not rest till every man,
                    who has performed military service —who have endured fatigue, and been exposed to danger,
                    to rescue and defend our country from the tomahawk and scalping knife, be paid the uttermost
                    farthing; and the Indiana Herald and the Western Sun, lest they should be too much engaged next

        <p>Fellow citizens; it is not rational, sentimental objection to my political acts, which has occasioned
                    the opposition I have recently experienced. It is too much[,] say they, that this man who but
                    yesterday came among us, without acquaintances, friends, wealth or patronage, should now represent
                    the state in congress.—It is the <hi

                    which have actuated my enemies; for what act of mine have they been able to find fault
                    with?—Where except in some trivial appointments for which my clamorous enemies
                    were applicants, do they attempt to charge me? What duty have I neglected?
                    What done amiss? They have not been able to say. Their specifications point to their own
                    disappointments. Their general allegations are mere lampoonings and abuses. Mark the course and
                    channel of opposition, and the time when it commenced. As early as January last, immediately after
                    the editors of the Herald found they were not appointed printers of the laws of the <placeName>

                    for the special purpose as was well understood of selecting a candidate to oppose me for Congress.
                    And here it may be remarked, that by this time it was known, at Corydon, that Mr. Brandon was

                    attended, and some of those few were opposed to the policy about to be pursued. Nothing at that time
                    was done but to make arrangements for a future day.—This day was pitched upon. It was the
                    28th day of April, the first day of the court, when the citizens of Harrison [County] were expected
                    generally to attend, and who it was presumed would be favorable to a candidate at that place. It
                    then could have been said that the candidate thus taken up was nominated by a large and respectable
                    meeting. But a series of disasters again took place, a writer over the signature of
                    "Vesuvius" in the Western Sun of the 29th of March, mistaking the movers and the
                    object of these caucuses, belches forth his lava on the measure, and threatens a total discomfiture
                    of all the schemes and plans so fast maturing. The people too, very unexpectedly disapproved of the
                    whole proceeding. The caucus was abandoned, and the man at that time intended to have been taken up,
                    abandoned the idea of becoming a candidate. Disorder appeared in the ranks, a misunderstanding
                    between the Sun and Herald, and this mighty caucus frustrated. The Herald however on the 10th May
                    justifies caucus nominations, as much the "best way" of selecting on the ground of
                    "example" and "reason."—But behold on the 24th of
                    May, one of its editors<hi
            rend="sup">12</hi> announces himself a candidate for Congress, without
                    following the dictates of the "best" way of "example" or
                    "reason." Mighty newspaper editorial exertions were used from this time to the day
                    of election, in which every thing was resorted to, which afforded the most remote prospect of weight
                    or influence. I was represented as vain and arrogant, wishing "that some popular character
                    should be brought forward to oppose me at the next congressional election, and I would shew them
                    that opposition was useless." This was low groveling policy indeed, but it was not without
                    a parallel.— About the first of August Governor [Thomas] Posey became a candidate. And
                    how was he taken up? Was it by the people, by his own wishes, or by a caucus?
                    By the latter, it may be said without fear of contradiction, a caucus at Vmcennes, at which but very
                    few attended. The Western Sun which on former occasions shewed so much hostility to this kind of

                    not a word to say. His character both public and private, as far as I know, I admire—I
                    early formed a favorable opinion of him, and that opinion I have not yet changed. Had I been brought
                    into public view for the first time when he became a candidate for congress, I would in all
                    probability have declined a competition, and given way to greater experience and merit. But my
                    situation was a different one. Governor Posey was brought forward by my avowed and inveterate
                    enemies, who have practised everything but fair dealing to injure &amp; destroy me. He suffered
                    himself to be taken up if report be true contrary to his wishes, and certainly contrary to his
                    interests for he had and still has a situation much more lucrative and better suited to his age and
                    infirmities. To have declined would have been disaster to myself &amp; triumph to my
                    enemies—would have been worse than defeat. I now stand elected your representative to
                    Congress for two years. During that time I shall unceasingly and undeviat-ingly employ my industry
                    and all the talents I possess to promote your political interests. My political tenets and
                    principles I presume are congenial with the great mass of my constituents, warmly and devotedly
                    republican. My feelings and habits are so also.—My interests are your

                    without office either in possession or expectancy—had no prospects other than those of a
                    private citizen. How long or how short soever my political life may last, I shall ever cherish a
                    grateful remembrance of the virtuous and independent citizens of Indiana. To them I owe, and

                    believe to their general satisfaction, &amp; with an ordinary degree of credit to myself. I was
                    afterwards appointed District Attorney for the territory, and since the formation of our
                    constitution, have twice been elected your representative in Congress. This fellow citizens is my
                    political history. No part of the scene is shaded with antiquity. It is all of recent occurrence. It

                    soldier, at his option, one dollar per acre, in lieu of the lands he is entitled to receive. It had
                    for its object his benefit alone. It was negatived by a majority of two votes in the house of

        <p>A law has passed making further provision for the superannuated and indigent officers and soldiers of
                    the revolutionary war. It gives, under certain restrictions, to the officers of the revolution 20,

        <p rend="center">WASHINGTON CITY, February 15th, 1819.</p>
        <p>SIR,</p>
        <p>At the commencement of the present session, the House of Representatives proceeded to the list of
                    orders of the day, and until a late period, have been engaged in legislating upon the unfinished
                    business of last session. This unfinished business was principally a long list of individual claims
                    against the government: most of which had their origin in the late war, while some were of equal
                    date with the revolution. No question of great national importance presented itself for discussion,
                    until the Committee on Military Affairs, on the subject of the Seminole war, had made their report.
                    This report had long been looked for with anxiety, as likely to present for consideration questions
                    of much national importance. It gave rise to a very long and animated discussion, which took into
                    view the origin, progress, and termination, of the Seminole war, with its incidents; the seizure and
                    military occupation of the Spanish posts of St. Mark's and Pensacola, and the fortress of
                    the Barancas [in <placeName>
            <region reg="flu" type="state">Florida</region>
          </placeName>].</p>
        <p>Much difference of opinion existed as to the constitutionality of the military movements of General
                    [Andrew] Jackson across the line, and the seizure and detention of the fortresses and territory of a

            <country reg="sp">Spain</country>

        <p>At an early period of the session, a Committee of the House of Representatives were appointed to

            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
          </placeName>. This Committee repaired to <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>

          </placeName> for that purpose, and after a long and arduous examination and inquiry, made their
                    report. This report is an <hi
            rend="i">expose</hi> of a series of improprieties on the part of the
                    directors, not perhaps equalled in the history of any other moneyed institution. It has been
                    referred to a Committee of the whole House, on the state of the Union, and will shortly be taken up.
                    The Committee also reported a Bill, to correct the abuses of the directory, and to prevent them in
                    future. This bill will have many advocates, but I think it will not pass. If it were
                    unconstitutional to grant the charter at first, it is unconstitutional now to amend it. If so much
                    evil, and so littie [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] good, have thus far been produced by the institution,
                    good policy would say, that the charter should be declared forfeited; that a few moneyed capitalists
                    at <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
          </placeName> should no longer govern the circulating medium of our country, and lay their heavy hand
                    on any district of the community they might think proper to press. They have had less specie capital
                    for the business they have done, than many local banks to whom they have refused credit; and have
                    afforded no commercial facilities, except to the East <placeName>
            <country reg="ii">India</country>
          </placeName> trade, in the article of specie for exportation.</p>

        <p>A proposition will be offered to repeal the charter, on the ground of its unconstitutionality, and on
                    the ground that no rights have vested in individuals, the previous conditions required by the
                    charter not having been performed by the stockholders. Should this fail, a proposition will be made
                    to direct a scire facias, in conformity with the act, calling upon the Corporation to show cause why
                    its charter should not be declared forfeited. This mammoth institution has become, in many places,
                    very unpopular. It has not answered the ends for which it was created. It has afforded few

                    of the country. It has enriched its directors and stock-jobbers, at the expense of others. Its
                    depressing and monopolizing policy, in the western country, has borne, and is bearing, peculiarly

        <p>A law will in all probability pass, giving a further extension of one year in favour of the

                    be controlled, or removed, before we can expect prosperity, to be restored to the West. The conduct
                    of the local banks of the western country, is not to be justified; but the branches of the <placeName>

          </placeName>' Bank ceasing to injure us, the disorders of the paper currency of the solvent
                    banks, would, by the course and competition of business, be removed.</p>

        <p>I have some hopes that the Secretary of the Treasury will authorize the reception of the local bank

        <p>SIR: Since the commencement of the present Session of Congress, subjects as various in their nature,
                    as in their extent and importance, have been brought into view. Many subjects of general national
                    concern, have presented themselves for consideration, while the great mass of cases, belong to the
                    class of private claims for property impressed into the service, or lost and destroyed in the
                    service during the late war.</p>

                    Its discussion was warm and animated. It was protracted beyond the length of ordinary debate; and
                    was disagreeable in the bitterness and excitement it produced. This was the character of a debate
                    which lasted in the House of Representatives more than a month, and nearly as long in the Senate.

        <p>The military establishment of the <placeName>
            <country reg="-us">United States</country>

          </placeName>, since the close of the Revolution, has been constantly varying. From the reduction of
                    the army at the close of the Revolutionary war to the year 1787, the military establishment scarce
                    made an item in the public expenditure. In that year it was deemed expedient to station a corps of
                    seven hundred troops on the frontiers, for the protection of the inhabitants against the Indians. In
                    '89, this establishment did not amount to six hundred. From that time to the year 1810, the
                    numbers of the army were fluctuating, seldom exceeding 3,500 men. In 1812 war was declared, and the
                    army, in 1815, had increased to 32,000, independent of the vast numbers of <pb
            id="VAA4025-070-4-054" n="332"/> militia, which had been called into the service at various periods
                    during the war.</p>
        <p>In 1815, the present military peace establishment was fixed. The President was authorized to retain
                    in the service, not exceeding 10,000 men. In December, of the same year, the numbers retained in
                    service were 9413, and at the close of the last year, it was estimated to amount to 9,000 men. This
                    army is stationed at the various fortifications on the sea-board, the northern frontier, with a
                    strong detachment at the Council Bluffs, on the <placeName>

            <country reg="-us">United States</country>

          </placeName>, since the late war, has been the peculiar favourite of the nation. Previous to that
                    war, the bravery and skill of our seamen, though signalized in the Mediterranean, had not fully
                    developed themselves to the American people.<hi rend="sup">30</hi> Until then, the people of the <placeName>
            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
          </placeName> were opposed to an extensive or permanent establishment, and the naval armaments of
                    former times were only intended for temporary purposes; which when effected, the vessels were sold,
                    and the armaments reduced. Such was the fact, in pursuance of the act of 1801, when fifteen vessels,
                    were sold for less than one half of what they had recently cost. A navy was thought to be beyond the
                    resources of the country; and it was not supposed, that the people would incline to be taxed for its
                    support.</p>

        <p>In 1811, the British navy consisted of 1042 vessels. Of this number in 1813, there were 164 in the
                    American Seas; while the American naval force in actual service in 1814, amounted to no more than
                    twenty-seven vessels. With such a disparity of force, and such an extent of coast on which it was
                    necessary for our little navy to cruize, nothing but defeat and capture, could reasonably have been
                    expected. But its brilliant achievements, on the ocean and the lakes, during the late war, has given
                    a character, and created for it a national pride, which continues to foster and cherish the <list type="footnotes">

                    been referred, until a late period of the session. A report was at length presented to the House by
                    that committee, authorizing the taking possession of the Floridas and other contiguous territory
                    claimed by <placeName>

        <p>This message proposed for the consideration of Congress, the propriety of waiting the arrival of the

            <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
          </placeName>, before strong measures should be adopted in relation to that government. This minister
                    who has just arrived, is said to be clothed with explanations of the non-ratification of the treaty
                    on the part of the Spanish king, and with full powers to settle all controversies between the two
                    governments. The friendly interferences of the governments of Europe, particularly that of Russia;
                    their wishes that no step should be taken by the American government, which would lead to a war with <placeName>
            <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
          </placeName>, have, in part, dictated the measures recommended in the message. From various sources,
                    additional assurances have been given, that during the ensuing summer, will be terminated, our very
                    long negotiations with that government. Some resolutions have since been offered, which have drawn
                    the House incidentally, into the discussion of the treaty and the Spanish affairs generally; but no
                    practical result will be produced on this subject, during the present session. It is most probable
                    the treaty will be ratified.</p>

        <p>A resolution has been submitted, declaring it expedient to provide by law, a suitable outfit and
                    salary, for such minister or ministers as the president, by and with the advice and consent of the
                    Senate, may send to any of the governments of South America, which have established, and are
                    maintaining their independence. This resolution, if again taken up, will, in all probability pass
                    the House of Representatives. It would be desirable, that the government of the <placeName>
            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
          </placeName>, whose political tenets, the rising republics of the south are endeavoring to adopt,
                    should be the first to acknowledge their independence.</p>
        <p>The bill to suspend forfeitures [of unpaid-for land] for another year, has become a law. It is the
                    same in principle with the law of last session on that subject. It saves from forfeiture until the
                    31st of March, 1821, and protects no more than 640 acres in the hands of one person.</p>

        <p>The prompt payment bill, or the bill changing the present land system [to cash sales only], has
                    passed the Senate, and will, in all probability become a law. The represensatives <hi rend="i">[sic]</hi> from the east and the south, have become alarmed at the extent of the present landed
                    debt in the new States. This debt amounts, in all, to 22,000,000 dollars. Unable to arrest the
                    progress of the bill which last year proposed the price at one dollar and fifty cents per acre, it
                    has been the object of all from the west, to get the price as low as possible; and it is now likely
                    to pass at one dollar and twenty-five cents. Should the tendency of this change of system be found
                    prejudicial to the western States, this good may, at all events, be expected to accompany
                    it;—government will be more inclined to indulge those who are at present indebted, and
                    who are unable to pay for their lands.</p>
        <p>The necessities of the times have been fertile of expedients, to supply a deficit of currency, and to
                    restore credit to the circulating medium of the country.</p>
        <p>With this view, the House of Representatives by resolution of the last session, instructed the
                    secretary of the treasury [William H. Crawford], among other things, to report to Congress, at an
                    early period of the present session, such measures, as in his opinion may be expedient to procure
                    and retain, a sufficient quantity of gold and silver coin in the <placeName>
            <country reg="-us">United States</country>

          </placeName>, or to supply a circulating medium in place of specie, adapted to the exigencies of the
                    country, and within the power of the government. The report of the secretary <pb
            id="VAA4025-070-4-057" n="335"/> in obedience to this resolution, is against the policy of an issue of
                    treasury notes or government paper; and his opinion is, that any attempt by the substitution of a
                    paper currency, to arrest the evils we are suffering, would be abortive and produce the worst of
                    consequences.</p>
        <p>For these evils, public opinion is the best, and, perhaps, the only efficient corrective. Banks
                    unable to redeem their paper, will, as they ought, ultimately go down; while those banks which are
                    solvent, will resume a business which they can sustain, and which will be justified by the metallic
                    capital of the country.</p>

        <p>The encouragement of domestic manufactures [by means of a protective tariff] is a favourite measure
                    with a great many members. For this purpose bills have been reported to the House, but have not yet
                    been taken up. The merchants of the north, and the planters of the south, are generally opposed to
                    this interest—and whether a majority of the present Congress will be found in its favour

                    ardently pressed. The pecuniary embarrassments of the times, have been co-extensive with the Union.
                    The interests and necessities of almost every section, have found their way into the Hall, and have

        <p>The protection of our manufactures; of our shipping interests; the mercantile concerns or conditions
                    of our country; the more national subject of our Spanish relations; and that which above all is most
                    important to the Western Country, the subject of relief to purchasers of public
                    lands—have all been presented to our view, &amp; till very lately have all been
                    unacted upon, or acted upon without effect; while the distressing tendency, and the consumption of

        <p>The long agitated and deeply interesting subject of our relations with <placeName>
            <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
          </placeName> has at length been put at rest. The <placeName>
            <region reg="flu" type="state">Florida</region>
          </placeName> [Adams-Onis] Treaty has been ratified by the King, with the consent and authority of
                    the Cortes, and has again been ratified by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the
                    Senate. Full effect thereby given to its provisions.</p>

        <p>By this treaty we gain the Floridas, on the south and on the west a district of territory in breadth
                    seven degress <hi rend="i">[sic]</hi>, or 483 miles, and extending from the western limits of the

        <p>The bill for the relief of the purchasers of public lands, has at length become a law.<hi rend="sup">43</hi> It is liberally adapted to the situation of the Territories, and the new States. It
                    permits the purchasers, or legal holders of land certificates, on or before the 30th day of
                    September 1821, to relinquish in writing to the Register of the Land Office, a part of the land held
                    and not paid for, in payment of the residue, or part of the residue, which they may retain. All the
                    moneys paid on the land so relinquished, shall be applied so as to complete the payment, on some one
                    or more tract retained, where the sums are sufficient for that purpose. On tracts paid for in this
                    way, no deduction of principal is made, but in all cases, the interest previous to the 30th of
                    September, 1821, is remitted.</p>

        <p>It further provides, that all purchasers, who do not relinquish a sufficient quantity of land to
                    close their accounts with the Government, shall be divided into three classes. The first class,
                    includes persons who have paid one fourth; the second class, those who have paid one half; and the

        <p>SIR: Few Sessions of Congress, since the commencement of the government, have taken up more business
                    of great national importance, than the present. The ratio and apportionment of representation for
                    the present census, occupied its early attention. The difficulties incident to this subject, the
                    diversity of interests in various sections of the Union and the consequent difference of opinion in
                    relation to the number proper for the House of Representatives, together with the delay occasioned
                    by the want of returns from <list type="footnotes">

                    until a late period of the Session; and the legislatures of several States, will have special
                    Sessions during the present year, for the purpose of forming Congressional districts.</p>
        <p>The members elected under the present census, will take their seats in the next
                    Congress,—the ratio is fixed at 40,000. The State of Indiana is entitled to three
                    members, and the legislature have done wisely, in anticipating the number and in districting the
                    State, thereby avoiding the necessity of an extra Session for that purpose.</p>
        <p>On the formation of the Government under the constitution of the <placeName>
            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
          </placeName>, the House of Representatives consisted of 65 members. For the first census, the number
                    was increased to 105; for the second to 141; for the third to 181, and for the
                    presents—the fourth census, it will be organised with 212; making in a little more than
                    40 years, an increase of more than double its original number, while the ratio of representation has
                    risen from thirty to forty thousand. The population, according to the census of 1790, was 3,921,326;
                    that of 1800, was 5,319,762; that of 1810, 7,239,902; and that of 1820, is 9,637,999. Thus in the
                    short space of 40 years, almost tripling our population, while the nations of the old world, are in
                    this respect on the ebb and flow, sometimes increasing, and sometimes decreasing, as plenty or
                    famine, peace or war, happen to favor or to frown upon human life.</p>
        <p>The bill for the organization of a Territorial Government for the Floridas, although reported at an
                    early period, did not until lately become a law. A proposition for the annexation of West <placeName>
            <region reg="flu" type="state">Florida</region>
          </placeName> to <placeName>
            <region reg="alu" type="state">Alabama</region>
          </placeName>, was made by the Legislature of that State, and was much pressed in the Senate. The
                    policy too of annexing East <placeName>
            <region reg="flu" type="state">Florida</region>
          </placeName> to <placeName>
            <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
          </placeName>, was spoken of; but their limits are not changed, and the bill for their government,
                    recognises the same boundaries they had in the hands of <placeName>
            <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
          </placeName>.</p>

        <p>The bankrupt bill, a measure almost as important to the commercial interests of the east, as our land
                    [relief] bill of last Session to us in the west, was strongly urged upon the House of
                    Representatives, and seems to have been lost by the mismanagement of its friends. The merchants now,
                    as the manufacturers heretofore, by asking too much, have got nothing. They asked to be shielded in
                    prosperity, from those <pb
            id="VAA4025-070-4-062" n="340"/> debts which in adversity they had become
                    unable to pay, and that the jurisdiction created by the bill, should be put into the hands of the
                    courts of the <placeName>
            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
          </placeName>; increasing, in a great degree, the mammoth power already in the hands of the federal
                    judiciary.</p>

        <p>Early in the session, the committee on the public lands, reported a bill, amendatory to the land
                    relief law of last session. It authorises those who did not avail themselves of the provisions of
                    that law, to transact their business in the land offices, on or before the 30th of September next,
                    &amp; places them in the same situation with those who come forward previous to the 30th of
                    Sept. last. This bill has passed both houses, &amp; wants only the signature of the president to
                    become a law.<hi rend="sup">45</hi>

        <p>Funds have been provided, for the payment in full of the pensioners within the state.<hi rend="sup">46</hi> This was unavoidably procrastinated, until the appropriation bill, containing that item
                    of expenditure, should pass—the sums previously appropriated for that object, having been

            <country reg="-us">United States</country>

          </placeName>, have experienced much change. The nett revenue of 1815, was little less than fifty
                    millions of dollars. In 1820, it was little more than fifteen millions. The first years of the peace
                    were years of unexampled prosperity. The national debt which on the 30th September, 1815, was
                    estimated at one hundred and fifty eight millions of dollars, was, on the 30th of September, 1820,
                    reduced to ninety one millions, payments having been made in that interval, to the amount of sixty
                    six millions. In the single year of 1817, the disbursements on account of the principal and interest
                    of the public debt, amounted to more than 25 millions. This was prosperity perhaps unparallelled.
                    But in the year 1820, the other side of the picture presented itself. In that year a loan of three
                    millions became necessary, to defray the ordinary expenses of the Government; and to pay the
                    interest of the debt. During the last year, the same policy was pursued; increasing, instead of
                    diminishing the debt of 91 millions. The importations of 1815 and '16 were excessive: they
                    far exceeded our exports—put the balance of trade largely against us, and drained the
                    country of the precious metals. Nor indeed can we reasonably expect a very great improvement <list type="footnotes">

                    markets furnish so little demand for our exports, by which our imports must necessarily be
                    regulated.</p>

        <p>This state of affairs will impose the necessity on Congress of diminishing the expenditure of the
                    Government, and of managing its Treasury on principles of economy which the present times
                    imperiously require. Our peace establishments were organized in the year 1815, when the revenues of
                    the country promised means equal to the wishes of prodigality itself; and it is not wonderful, that
                    at the close of a war, in which the Army and the Navy were identified with the affections of the
                    people those establishments should have been made as they were. But our expenditures must be brought
                    within our means and the administration of Mr. Monroe will terminate with increased reputation,
                    should he go forward, as it is believed he will, in such system of economy and retrenchment as will
                    afford the prospect of extinguishing the National Debt in a reasonable time, and promote the solid
                    improvement, and prosperity of the nation. The army has already been reduced to 6,000 men; and a
                    bill is reported to fix a naval peace establishment, leaving the Navy in the opinion of its friends
                    as effective as it now is, and reducing considerably its charge upon the Treasury.<hi rend="sup">52</hi>
        </p>
        <p>For the want of National prosperity, however, we ought not to complain. The pecuniary affairs of the
                    country, it is true, have undergone a very great change. The nation, as well as individuals, have
                    felt that change. Neither the one nor the other are yet prepared for the present state of things.
                    The quantity of our circulating medium has been much reduced. Public opinion has driven from
                    circulation worthless Bank paper, and the merchants have exchanged our specie for European goods;
                    but men have returned to their natural pursuits. Speculation is more generally abandoned, and the
                    credit system done away; and when the embarrassments produced by former times shall have
                    disappeared, we shall not want the quantity of circulating medium which heretofore has been
                    necessary for us. Within the last year manufactures have flourished more than at any period previous
                    to the last war; and the population of the Western Country has advanced with a rapidity heretofore
                    unknown.</p>

        <p>The papers published in this volume were delivered at the second Library of Congress Symposium on the
                    American Revolution. The first symposium in 1972 took as its theme <hi rend="i">The Development of a
                        Revolutionary Mentality.</hi> Subsequent conferences will discuss leadership in the era of the
                    Revolution (1974), the impact of the Revolution abroad (1975), and the incomplete Revolution (1976).
                    They all form part of the library's salute to the Bicentennial.</p>
        <p>The fundamental testaments here discussed are Tom Paine's <hi rend="i">Common Sense</hi>,
                    the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, and the Treaty of <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
          </placeName> of 1783; and on each of these Bernard Bailyn, Cecelia Kenyon, Merrill Jensen, and R. B.
                    Morris, respectively, write elegant and informed essays. Obviously, as Julian Boyd says in
                    introducing the papers, other topics could have been selected or at least added to these: the <placeName>
            <region reg="vau" type="state">Virginia</region>
          </placeName> Statute for Religious Freedom, George Mason's draft of the <placeName>
            <region reg="vau" type="state">Virginia</region>
          </placeName> Declaration of Rights, the Treaty of Alliance with <placeName>
            <country reg="fr">France</country>
          </placeName>, and not least the Ordinances of 1784 and 1787—but all of these are omitted
                    or at least seen as less "Fundamental." But one can be grateful for these four
                    essays which, despite their brevity, give the views and verdicts of four masters of Revolutionary
                    scholarship.</p>

        <p>Bernard Bailyn's task was perhaps the most difficult of all, since, with all its fire and
                    its timing, <hi
            rend="i">Common Sense</hi> is not a work with the quality of the other three
                    documents. Compared to many of the Revolutionary leaders, Paine was an
                    "ignoramus," admits Bailyn. He does not attempt to measure the pamphlet's
                    influence on independence but to isolate its special quality—"something bizarre,
                    outsize, unique" (p. 11). Part of that quality lies in the power of its language, vivid and
                    sharp, and the force of its imagery. Part of it lies in the even greater force of its
                    "intellectual idiom," its capacity for looking afresh at the basic habits of
                    Anglo-American thought. But to Bailyn "the dominant tone of <hi rend="i">Common Sense</hi>
                    is that of rage"; its aim was "to tear the world apart" (p. 20). And this
                    is a quality that Bailyn believes links it both with the left wing views of the English Civil War
                    and equally with the brilliant savagery of William Hogarth's paintings.</p>
        <pb id="VAA4025-070-4-068" n="346"/>
        <p>Merrill Jensen brings out the extent of the divisions that lay behind the drafting of the Articles,
                    divisions that were ideological, social, and economic. The Articles reflected those divisions. It
                    was in his view "a way station on the road to another constitution" (p. 76), and
                    it expressed the views of those like Sam Adams and Richard Henry Lee who believed that a truly
                    federal government of sovereign states was the best government for a diverse nation.</p>

        <p>Professor Morris does not attempt in his essay the difficult, indeed impossible, task of summarizing
                    in twenty pages the treaty making of 1782-1783, which he did brilliantly and in depth in his <hi rend="i">The Peacemakers.</hi> His essay is indeed a commentary on that book—on the
                    difficulties facing the negotiators, on their skill in yielding on trivial questions in order to
                    ensure absolute independence, and a continental domain, for the thirteen states. Unfortunately he
                    does not resist the temptation of drawing comparisons with the North <placeName>
            <country reg="vm">Vietnam</country>
          </placeName> War and the North <placeName>
            <country reg="vm">Vietnam</country>
          </placeName> negotiations. Many of these references will, one suspects, become rapidly dated, nor
                    are the parallels always easy to sustain.</p>
        <p>The essay of greatest subtlety and value in this book, however, is Cecelia Kenyon's study of
                    the Declaration. She sees its links with the world and the words of the Levellers, along lines that
                    Bailyn would endorse. She praises its qualities of indefiniteness and imprecision and notes the
                    absence from this revolutionary theory, unlike later variants, of "a hierarchy of
                    values" (p. 36). America's revolutionary strength lay in its long experience of
                    constitutional, if not formally of republican, politics, and in the talents of some great men,
                    notably Thomas Jefferson himself. And in emphasizing Jefferson's own concern with property,
                    she notes the phenomenon which in the end weakened the social revolutionary potential of this
                    particular Revolution.</p>
        <p>In his useful concluding essay, James Russell Wiggins, long editor and ornament of the <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
          </placeName>
          <hi rend="i">Post</hi> and now editor and publisher of the <hi
            rend="i">Ellsworth American</hi>,
                    dwells on the relevance of these fundamental texts for the present day. The authors of the documents
                    were writing for later ages, as well as their own, and were aware of the need for "a decent
                    respect to the opinions of mankind." Wiggins reminds the reader that the Paine of 1776 was
                    somewhere else twenty <pb
            id="VAA4025-070-4-069" n="347"/> years later and was by that time no lover

                            limitations on human achievement. We can be more easily roused to the arduous pursuit of
                            happiness than we can be persuaded to accept the realization that it cannot always be
                            achieved.</p>
            <p>What do the testaments of that small, embryonic state have to say to the great nation it has
                            become?</p>
            <p>Oddly enough, they have more to say than ever before, because they are filled with wisdom
                            that counsels restraint in the exercise of great power—restraint in the
                            application of that power abroad, restraint in the imposition of that power on citizens at
                            home. And the greater the nation becomes, the greater the country becomes, and the more
                            powerful its government becomes, the more it needs that wisdom.</p>

        <p>The testaments and the words in them mattered greatly. But words can deceive. It was the quality of
                    the men in power in the Revolution, the men who wrote and used the words but knew their limitations
                    and their dangers, that made of them not propagandists but statesmen.</p>

        <p>It is surprising that some such book as this has not been written before. Since World War II American
                    diplomatic history has matured as a research field. Yet most standard constitutional histories still
                    underplay the role of Confederation foreign relations in shaping the Constitution, except for treaty
                    making, appointive powers, and the two thirds rule. Even in the 1920s Samuel Flagg Bemis and Arthur
                    P. Whitaker implied many things about the background of the Constitution which have long called for
                    explicit development; and more recent scholarship on the foreign relations of the Confederation
                    period needs to be related to the discussions of the 1787 convention.</p>

        <p>It is this task which Professor Marks has undertaken. Briefly stated, his thesis is that the
                    cumulative humiliations <pb
            id="VAA4025-070-4-070" n="348"/> suffered by the young Confederation in
                    the 1780s—the British retention of the Northwest forts and refusal to open the West
                    Indies freely to American shipping; the Spanish efforts to maneuver John Jay into accepting the
                    temporary closure of the <placeName>
            <region reg="msu" type="state">Mississippi</region>
          </placeName>; and the depredations of the Barbary pirates—reinforced nationalist demands
                    for a strong government which could make the <placeName>
            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
          </placeName> respected abroad. Balanced neatly between causes which would inflame seaboard
                    merchants, southern planters, and western settlers, these humiliations helped create a national mood
                    (which Marks summarizes effectively in one of his best chapters). Without this mood it might have
                    been difficult to prevail on the states to give up some of their rights.</p>
        <p>Most of this thesis is familiar enough, but Marks has developed it more fully and explicitly than
                    anyone else. He presents it attractively enough for nonspecialists and with enough footnotes for
                    most specialists. The insistence on the importance of Barbary depredations is a relatively new
                    emphasis. The chapter on the West Indian trade question challenges some earlier writings but offers
                    a lucid and generally convincing account. Marks is not quite so effective on the Northwest forts;
                    here the reader should revert to Bemis and A. L. Burt for a better exposition. Marks seems to accept
                    the British case against the <placeName>
            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
          </placeName> for failure to enforce the peace treaty regarding Loyalists and debts, without
                    emphasizing the significance of the treaty phraseology ("Congress shall earnestly
                    recommend," etc.) or the apparent bad faith of George Ill's restraining order to
                    the governor general of <placeName>
            <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
          </placeName>, drawn up the day before His Majesty signed the treaty.</p>
        <p>The emphasis of the book falls on the background of the Constitutional Convention. In his one chapter
                    on the convention Marks wisely does not attempt detailed coverage; nor does he emphasize those
                    questions which proved of lasting importance. Considering the many later controversies over treaties
                    in and around the <placeName>
            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
          </placeName> Senate, the reader might wish a little more discussion of the treaty making power <hi rend="i">per se.</hi> But this emphasis is consistent with the general orientation of the book;
                    it looks backward toward precedents and causes, rather than forward toward the effects of actions
                    taken at <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
          </placeName> in 1787.</p>

        <p>This book will fill a palpable gap in courses dealing with the Confederation period and with early
                    American foreign <pb
            id="VAA4025-070-4-071" n="349"/> relations. Students inquisitive enough to read
                    the introduction will get a bonus—a concise summary of historiography concerning the
                    Constitution.</p>

        <p>John Francis MeDermott, who has spent much of his distinguished career studying the early history of
                    the <geogName>Mississippi Valley</geogName>, has assembled a collection of sixteen essays describing
                    various facets of that region during the years that it was under Spanish control. Employing the same
                    format that he utilized in two earlier works that surveyed French influence in the
                        <geogName>Mississippi Valley</geogName>, MeDermott includes articles by many of Spanish <placeName>
            <region reg="lau" type="state">Louisiana</region>
          </placeName>'s most prominent scholars.</p>
        <p>The collection opens with Father John Francis Bannon's brief introductory essay which
                    provides an overview of early Spanish activity in the <geogName>Mississippi Valley</geogName>. Three
                    subsequent articles by Father Charles Edwards O'Neill, A. Otis Hebert, Jr., and C. Harvey
                    Gardiner examine the present state of studies on Spanish colonial <placeName>
            <region reg="lau" type="state">Louisiana</region>
          </placeName> and suggest future research opportunities in the field.</p>
        <p>The evolution of <placeName>
            <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
          </placeName>'s land policy is the topic of C. Richard Arena's essay, and this
                    article is followed by William S. Coker's discussion of the role of the Bruin family in the
                    formulation of Spanish immigration policies for <placeName>
            <region reg="lau" type="state">Louisiana</region>
          </placeName> in the 1780s. John Preston Moore and Robert L. Gold relate incidents in the careers of
                    Antonio de Ulloa and Bernardo de Galvez to the development of Anglo-Spanish relations in North
                    America. Abraham P. Nasatir offers some newly discovered documents that help fill gaps in his
                    previously published accounts of pioneer-explorer Pedro Vial, while Noel M. Loomis traces the
                    activities of adventurer Philip Nolan and speculates about his possible involvement with James
                    Wilkinson.</p>

        <p>Other selections include Jack D. L. Holmes' examination of Spanish attempts to regulate
                    taverns and the liquor trade in the <geogName>Mississippi Valley</geogName> and Samuel
                    Wilson's detailed account <pb
            id="VAA4025-070-4-072" n="350"/> of <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
          </placeName> philanthropist and builder Andres Almonester. Anthropologists John C. Ewers and Carl
                    Chapman provide useful assessments of Spanish attempts to manage Indian affairs. One of the finest
                    essays in the collection is John G. Clark's perceptive analysis of the role of municipal
                    government in the economic development of <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
          </placeName>. In the final selection, McDermott marshalls an array of documentary evidence to help
                    rescue Upper <placeName>
            <region reg="lau" type="state">Louisiana</region>
          </placeName>'s Lieutenant Governor Fernando de Leyba from charges of ineptitude.</p>
        <p>Much that is contained in these essays will be familiar to students of the <geogName>Mississippi
                        Valley</geogName>. Those expecting to find significant amounts of new material are likely to be
                    disappointed. The book covers a wide range of topics, but it also reflects <placeName>
            <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
          </placeName>'s limited impact upon <placeName>
            <region reg="lau" type="state">Louisiana</region>
          </placeName> after more than forty years of rule.</p>
        <p>As in any undertaking of this type, the essays vary in quality. Unfortunately many tend to be more
                    descriptive than analytical. Still the collection is solid, if not exciting. It provides useful
                    summaries, and in a few areas it expands knowledge and understanding of Spanish <placeName>

          </placeName>: McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1974. Pp. xv, 360. Maps, notes. $9.95.)</head>
        <p>This rich anthology assembles excerpts from the stories of well known folk heroes like Daniel <placeName>
            <region type="county">Boone</region>
          </placeName>, Davy Crockett, Kit Carson, and Buffalo Bill as well as almost two dozen other
                    "voices from the wilderness," many of them practically unknown to modern readers.
                    Selections range from the mid-eighteenth century pioneers in the Old West to the trappers and
                    traders on the Plains and in the Rockies in the nineteenth century. Designed for the general reader,
                    the accounts are relatively short, presented with brief introductions by the current editor but
                    without editorial changes from the early printings and with only an occasional editorial note by an
                    original editor.</p>
        <pb id="VAA4025-070-4-073" n="351"/>
        <p>Most of the men of the frontier knew how to tell a good story! Here one feels the terror
                    of Alexander Henry, a trader caught in the fort at Mackinac during Pontiac's Rebellion,
                    watching the massacre of his fellow Englishmen. One shares the purposefulness of Daniel <placeName>
            <region type="county">Boone</region>
          </placeName> walking away from his Indian captors to hike over one hundred sixty miles in five clays
                    with only one meal in order to warn the settlers of Boonesborough of impending attack or marvels at
                    John Colter's race for survival, naked, chased by vengeful Black-foot for six miles.</p>
        <p>As the editor notes, the frontiersmen helped to shape America's image of itself. But
                    excitement and color have too often made for myth and obscured reality. The frontier frequently
                    coarsened men. Arrogance and brutality are evident in many of these accounts, as well as an attitude
                    of cultural superiority toward the Indians. In search of private gain or adventure, the frontiersman
                    inevitably helped blaze the trails and passes that carried the nation westward, but he also
                    senselessly slaughtered the beaver and buffalo, provoked and killed Indians, and sometimes exhibited
                    a selfish callousness toward his own companions. On the other hand, these accounts also offer
                    surprising expressions of tenderness, appreciation of the grandeur of the wilderness, and a
                    remarkable sensitivity.</p>
        <p>Despite the subtitle and the dustjacket not all the accounts are true, as Froncek cautions, and some
                    of the tales are told about the frontiersmen and not by them. Readers must remember that tall tales
                    came naturally to the westerner, a typical kind of frontier wit often intentionally perpetrated on
                    the eastern dude.</p>
        <p>Hopefully, this collection will lead the interested reader back to the original, full accounts,
                    whetting his appetite for more about the story of our way west.</p>

        <p>During his active political career, William H. Crawford was regarded by most of his contemporaries as
                    a major national figure. He was senator from <placeName>
            <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
          </placeName> during the last <pb id="VAA4025-070-4-074" n="352"/> Jefferson and first <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
          </placeName> administrations and then went on to be minister to <placeName>
            <country reg="fr">France</country>
          </placeName> for two years. When the War of 1812 ended, Crawford was appointed secretary of war by
                    James <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
          </placeName>, after which he served throughout James <placeName>
            <region type="county">Monroe</region>
          </placeName>'s eight presidential years as secretary of the treasury. Extraordinarily
                    popular in Congress, politically adroit, very affable and physically attractive, Crawford seemed a
                    sure bet to become President of the <placeName>
            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
          </placeName>. He backed away from the nomination in 1816, and when illness struck him down in 1823,
                    his national career collapsed.</p>
        <p>Although his health improved sufficiently after his return to <placeName>
            <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
          </placeName> for him to serve competently as state superior judge for the northern circuit, his
                    influence at home steadily declined, and it is unlikely he would have been reelected when his term
                    on the bench expired in 1834. Crawford recognized this possibility and therefore asked President
                    Andrew Jackson for an appointment to the <placeName>
            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
          </placeName> Supreme Court when a place became vacant with the death of Justice William Johnson.
                    Unfortunately—or perhaps fortunately, considering all the blows he had sustained over the
                    last few years—he died two weeks after he made his request. Not much later it was said
                    that Crawford retained only a "shadow" of a reputation. Today, even that shadow
                    has disappeared. Scholars have neglected him. <placeName>
            <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
          </placeName> has accorded him scant recognition. His grave site goes unattended; the marble slab
                    covering the grave is broken; and the iron fence around it has fallen apart.</p>
        <p>Poor Crawford. He deserves a good biography because he was in fact an important figure of the early
                    nineteenth century. But his ill luck still persists, for the late Chase C. Mooney has not provided a
                    biography that does Crawford justice. Not that it was entirely Mooney's fault. Any Crawford
                    biographer is faced with an enormous problem at the very outset. The lack of a large collection of
                    manuscript sources is an insuperable difficulty. Crawford himself was careless about preserving his
                    correspondence, and he rarely made copies of outgoing letters. Furthermore, the effort of his
                    son-in-law, George M. Dudley, to preserve Crawford material was vitiated when the Dudley home burned
                    during the Civil War.</p>

        <p>Still the author might have done more with extant documents, both public and private. Little in the

          </placeName> invasion and the events leading to Jackson's discovery of John C.
                    Calhoun's "perfidy" is a case in point. "The story has been told
                    many times before," writes Mooney, "and will not be repeated here" (p.
                    318). Fair enough. But what of Crawford's involvement in the revelation?
                    "The exigencies of politics probably determined the actions of the principals,"
                    Mooney states; "if blame is to be attached, it should be spread among a half dozen or
                    so" (pp. 319-20). So much for the manner and motivation that set the events in motion,
                    although the author in a footnote does remark that there exists "no evidence of direct
                    collusion between Crawford and Martin <placeName>
            <region reg="vau" type="state">Van</region>
          </placeName> Buren in the Jackson-Calhoun matter" (p. 320, note 48). Again, the author is
                    not especially enlightening about the fierce animosity between Crawford and Jackson that developed
                    immediately following the Creek War. He concedes that Crawford's order to renegotiate the
                    Treaty of Fort Jackson may have had something to do with it. But why did Crawford issue the
                    order? Crawford spoke to the Indian chieftains, says Mooney, and believed their arguments
                    just! For a politician of Crawford's skills this explanation hardly seems
                    complete or adequate. Unfortunately, most of the book simply reworks old interpretations or accepts
                    without question rather naive explanations.</p>
        <p>Unlike his subject, the author is very cautious. He hedges about Crawford's debilitating
                    illness that struck him down in 1823. Was it "inflamatory rheumatism," as Crawford
                    himself believed, or bilious fever or erysipelas or a stroke? The reader is free to
                    choose among them. And what finally killed Crawford? The newspapers at the time described
                    it as an "affection of the heart" whatever that means. Mooney is content to leave
                    it at that.</p>
        <p>It is painful to write a negative review about a work whose author has recently died and over which
                    he labored so long and diligently. In fairness it should be said, as a final comment, that the book
                    is useful to scholars in gathering together in one place all that is known—and maybe
                    knowable —about the life of a distinguished politician of the early national period.</p>

                    Eugene L. Schwaab with the collaboration of Jacqueline Bull. Two volumes. (<placeName>

            <region reg="kyu" type="state">Kentucky</region>
          </placeName>, 1973. Pp. xiii, 579. Illustrations, notes, index. Set, $25.00.)</head>
        <p>According to the editor, this anthology of periodical literature "aims to present to the
                    social historian a representative sampling of original accounts of travel in the South from 1783 to
                    1860 …" (p. xi). This purpose has been achieved with distinction in this two
                    volume work. Editor Schwaab indicates an attempt to achieve a proper balance in the selection of
                    travel accounts for inclusion in this compilation based on geographical, chronological, and other
                    considerations. While these bases might seem unnecessarily rigid, the resulting selection indicates
                    otherwise.</p>
        <p>These travel accounts taken from magazines of the period are divided according to seven chronological
                    periods, starting with the conclusion of the Revolutionary War and terminating with the advent of
                    the Civil War. While certain themes, such as frontier life and agriculture, tend to predominate,
                    many aspects of southern life are discussed. Careful descriptions of rice, tobacco, and sugar cane
                    processing are interspersed with an account of forest fires, of an earthquake, of gold mining and
                    coal mining, of missionaries and itinerant preachers, of manufacturers, of river transportation, and
                    of mineral springs and other health resorts. Some travelers described conditions of travel and
                    travel accommodations so vividly as to give the reader little choice but to identify with the
                    traveler, sharing vicariously in both his excitement and his discomforts.</p>

        <p>The format of the volumes adds not a little to their attractiveness. The pages are double columned,
                    with each left hand page having a very wide left hand margin and each right hand page with a very
                    wide right hand margin. The illustrations (including that used on the cover), taken from the best
                    collections in the country, add immensely to the appearance (and content) of this work. However, it
                    is these very appearances which, on first impression, strike the reviewer as almost incongruous.
                    Professor Thomas D. Clark in the foreward indicates that these travel accounts constitute an
                    "historical resource" and Schwaab in the introduction says that they are selected
                    for the benefit of the "social <pb
            id="VAA4025-070-4-077" n="355"/> historian."
                    Perhaps the historian deserves occasionally to handle embellished resources! Perhaps too,
                    there is a place for this work in the library of the avid book connoisseur which the above writers
                    failed to mention.</p>
        <p>The serious historian might wish for even more editorial aids such as more references to parallel
                    accounts not found in this work. For example, Thomas Chapman's account of a trip through
                    the Upper South (pp. 23-42) was made just about the same time Moses Austin traveled over a part of
                    this same route. A reference to the Austin account would have been useful. While editorial comments
                    are common throughout both volumes and are perhaps all that could be expected in such an extensive
                    anthology, there seems occasionally to be room for more exhaustive research and/or editorial
                    comment. The illustrations are a little frustrating in this respect, indicating neither origin nor
                    identity of what is illustrated, although admittedly the latter is sometimes obvious.</p>

                    Sigelschiffer. (<placeName>
            <region reg="nyu" type="state">New York</region>
          </placeName>: Horizon Press, 1973. Pp. viii, 488. End maps, illustrations, notes, bibliography,
                    index. $12.95.)</head>

        <p>Any reader willing to plow through 433 pages of additional Lincoln literature has the right to expect
                    a fragment of something new and/or different. Thus, <hi rend="i">The American Conscience</hi> will
                    be a big disappointment. The book's topical outline is at least easily followed. The
                    initial chapter surveys the debate issues in the context of pre-Civil War history, with specific
                    emphasis upon the 1850s. Rarely is the probing deeper than the textbook level. The second part
                    investigates the two main participants while the third division devotes a chapter to each of the
                    seven debates.</p>

        <p>The concluding essay is a moralistic survey of Lincoln's racial views which sadly emerges as
                    the nineteenth century's "irrepressible conflict" in twentieth century
                    garb. Despite the dust jacket's claim to the contrary, Abraham Lincoln still appears as the
                    "Christ-like figure," and Stephen A. Douglas' touted
                    "rehabilitation" hardly goes beyond the work of George F. Milton. The
                    author's conclusions depend solely upon his unique interpretation of specific words in
                    Lincoln's writings, <pb
            id="VAA4025-070-4-078" n="356"/> and although he accuses others of
                    speculation, he also dabbles too deeply into history's "ifs."</p>
        <p>The faults involved in research and writing are staggering. The historian will be horrified with the
                    repeated documentary omission for huge blocks of substantive fact. Equally surprising is an almost
                    total reliance upon published documents and older secondary accounts. Neither the bibliography nor
                    the footnotes indicate any utilization of manuscript collections or newspaper files while attempting
                    to add some new facet to an already well known saga.</p>

        <p>The bibliography contains a few recent works, but rarely do these appear in the footnotes. Most
                    heavily used books were published before 1950. Surely the writings of Richard Heckman, Edwin Corwin,
                    Carl Swisher, Philip Klein, and Frank Hodder would add valuable insight into the author's
                    understanding of the debate topics. Although Don Fehrenbacher's <hi rend="i">Prelude to
                        Greatness</hi> is included in the bibliography, Sigelschiffer's chapters on the House
                    Divided speech and the <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Freeport</settlement>
          </placeName> debate demonstrate neither usage nor understanding of this significant work. The <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Charleston</settlement>

          </placeName> debate discussion ignores Charles Coleman's definitive study of that topic in
                    his <hi rend="i">Abraham Lincoln and <placeName>
              <region type="county">Coles County</region>

            </placeName>.</hi> The author claims to have traveled to the debate sites and acknowledges the
                    help of some local historians, but the invaluable aid which could have been provided locally by Dr.
                    Coleman or Dr. Glenn Seymour was apparently never tapped. For unexplained reasons valuable articles
                    in the <hi rend="i">Journal of the <placeName>
              <region reg="ilu" type="state">Illinois</region>
            </placeName> State Historical Society</hi> were apparently never consulted.</p>

        <p>In light of these major criticisms the book's other faults, including occasional lapses into
                    the first person and the use of archaic footnoting terms <hi
            rend="i">supra</hi> and <hi rend="i">op. cit.</hi>, pale by comparison. As a documentary volume, despite its far too extensive
                    quoting, this book cannot replace Paul Angle's more complete edition of the debates; and as
                    an interpretive study the research is too shallow to add greater depth to an already extensive body
                    of historical knowledge. While obviously there still are openings in the field of Lincoln lore, the
                    present study will, unfortunately, not fill any gaping holes. It will be a disappointment to the
                    professional historian as well as to the Lincoln buff.</p>

        <p>Marquette University Professor Francis Paul Prucha has added to the growing body of information on
                    Indian assimilation by linking together some forty primary sources (reports, speeches, articles,
                    etc.) penned by the "friends of the Indians" for the years 1880 to 1900. Quite
                    deliberately Prucha has qualified "friends" with quotes. His card stacked
                    collection attempts to prove that the policies advocated, and in part effected, by these well
                    intentioned white reformers—largely WASP educators, government officials, and authors,
                    including people such as Henry L. Dawes, Lyman Abbott, Carl Schurz, and Thomas J.
                    Morgan—proved "to be a disaster for the Indians, and therefore for the
                    nation" (p. 10).</p>
        <p>Prucha quite correctly flays the aggressive ethnocentrism of Gilded Age reformers; yet for all their
                    purblind cultural egoism these Americans genuinely sought to "elevate the Indian."
                    While it now seems disgusting that they wanted to turn him in a cultural sense into a white man, it
                    should never be forgotten that their blunderous assumptions were predicated on ultimate sociolegal
                    equality for the shattered native.</p>
        <p>Prucha notes this but fails to emphasize how many other citizens really believed "the only
                    good Indian is a dead Indian." How did Buffalo Bill and the diverse commercial groups
                    (probably beginning with the Mountain Man and extending to today's TV writers looking for a
                    "good show") link the Indian with the dominate culture? Colonel Cody,
                    for example, armed his Indian actors with guns and urged them to "yell like
                    hell—look as murderous as you can." In marked contrast the
                    "friends" gave them tools and books and counselled the Indians to prepare
                    themselves for inescapable absorption into the white world. Instead of making money on the Indian,
                    they raised and expended vast sums to protect and advance him along the path of the white man. In
                    fact, the "putting out system" found the "friends" enjoining
                    their fellow whites to "bring an Indian youth into your home."</p>
        <pb id="VAA4025-070-4-080" n="358"/>
        <p>Prucha's selections painfully confirm that the reformers' elementary assumptions
                    were naive, ignorant, and riddled with racism, but to saddle them with the major burden of guilt for
                    breaking "down the [Indians'] heritage and cultural pride" (p. 10), is
                    anachronistic. Before most of these reformers even had been born, the cruel cutting edge of the
                    frontier had eroded much of the indigenes' accustomed way of life. Almost from the initial
                    red-white contacts in the sixteenth century, aboriginal peoples found themselves irresistably
                    attracted to the invader's power, be it his gun, his bottle, or his iron pot. Indeed,
                    anthropologists have now speculated that well before the founding of Jamestown, European imported
                    diseases had laid waste millions of North American Indians. Certainly Indian contemporaries of the
                    "friends," warrior leaders such as Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull, cursed saloons
                    and stores with far greater frequency than they ever did schoolhouses.</p>

        <p>For readers desiring source material to lay bare the cultural myopia of Victorian America, here is a
                    well edited, heavily weighted instrument. On the other hand, readers seeking a more balanced account
                    of the complex intercultural tragedy produced by the red-white cultural collision—already
                    fixed on its disastrous course by 1860—should look elsewhere. An excellent place to begin

        <p>When Oliver Cromwell sat for a portrait and the artist was disposed to be overly solicitous about
                    omitting certain facial blemishes, the tough old <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Puritan</settlement>
          </placeName> protested that he wanted to be painted "warts and all." The author of
                    this book about Taylor University's century and a quarter history has not glossed over the
                    passages of crisis and dissension in telling the story. He has, however, written in an obvious
                    spirit of deep affection for the school and profound respect for its uniquely Christian mission in
                    higher education.</p>
        <pb id="VAA4025-070-4-081" n="359"/>
        <p>The book is one of a genre that normally has slight readership outside the constituency of the
                    college whose history is recited, and it is unlikely that this book will be of much wider interest.
                    The author admits that the book is a "house organ" (p. 7). But he has prepared a
                    useful and needed presentation of the story; despite the long career of the college, previously only
                    occasional historical sketches had appeared. He has given a balanced account bringing together in a
                    systematic and readable way the changes and progressions in administration (too often given
                    preponderant attention in such works) with the changing academic emphases, relations to the
                    supporters of the college, and even (chapter 7) the sports program of the school. Chapter 6 is
                    titled alliteratively "Religion, Recitations, and Recreation." Ringenberg sets the
                    whole account meaningfully in the broader contexts of American educational and religious history.
                    For example, the date of founding (1846) is depicted in terms of its unusual excitement in a
                    westward moving America (p. 20).</p>
        <p>Taylor University began in 1846 as the Fort <placeName>
            <region type="county">Wayne</region>
          </placeName> Female College under auspices of the Methodist Episcopal church. For Methodists
                    generally this was the period of transition from an earlier anti-intellectual attitude that deplored
                    the dangers of "book learning" for ministers. There were those who opposed higher
                    education for women as a disturbance of "God's order" (p. 15) and as
                    dangerous to the health of frail females; but in the education of women the Methodists pioneered. In

                    a dynamic and controversial (pp. 68 ff.) missionary leader; his strong involvement in the Holiness
                    movement is reflected in the school's continuing pietistic emphasis. Taylor University
                    remained affiliated with the Methodist Episopal church until 1922. North Central accreditation was

        <p>Moral and religious crusade has been the pattern of life at Taylor. Conduct was strictly regulated

                    of Prohibitionist activity" (p. 117), with students vying in producing orations against the
                    evil of alcohol. In the twenties William Jennings Bryan's crusade against evolution found

                    protracted revival meetings interspersed academic concerns; spiritual emphasis has undergone less
                    attrition than at most denominational schools.</p>
        <p>Teachers in the schools of most denominations will find nostalgic notes in the account of low
                    salaries (p. 34), heavy teaching loads (p. 124), scant time for research and writing (p. 151),
                    strict regulation of conduct in contrast to permissiveness elsewhere. The target audience will
                    appreciate its forthright emphasis both on the academic concerns and the special pietistic values of
                    the school.</p>

        <p>The third volume of Booker T. Washington's papers might well be subtitled "The Lull
                    Before the Storm," since it covers the six years immediately before the black
                    educator's emergence on the national scene as a white sponsored spokesman for black
                    aspirations and as a political manipulator of some significance within the Afro-American community.
                    Harlan and his associates have issued a model volume of collected papers to accompany the previous
                    two volumes published last year. The present volume contains a great many letters written to <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
          </placeName> as well as those from his pen, along with copies of speeches delivered by him to
                    various audiences and informal homilies which the college president was fond of relating to his
                    Tuskegee students on Sunday evenings. The famous speech at the <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Atlanta</settlement>
          </placeName> Exposition completes the entries in the main body of the book along with a draft
                    version which differs in some form from the final edition of the brief speech. As in the earlier
                    volumes in the series, each letter, speech, newspaper report, etc., is annotated with footnotes
                    identifying persons mentioned in the body of the entry and/or the context of the subject matter
                    discussed. The annotations are explanatory without becoming narratives in themselves.</p>

                    that dealing with the educator's marriage to Tuskegee's dean of women, Margaret
                    James Murray, following the untimely death of Olivia Davidson <placeName>

          </placeName>'s problems in finding a suitable housekeeper to take care of his brood before
                    his remarriage. Murray's letters to <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
          </placeName> are filled with complaints on the part of the former who appears to have been a strong
                    willed person unwilling to accept a subordinate position in any relationship. No letters from <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
          </placeName> to Murray dated during this period are included, but references to them in the text of
                    Murray's correspondence indicates that they were merely brief notes.</p>
        <p>As the president of a growing black college gaining in significance during the early 1890s, <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
          </placeName> was in considerable demand as a public speaker before northern and southern audiences,
                    and he never failed to capitalize on his appearances by making either direct or indirect appeals for
                    funds. The volume includes a great many letters to and from Tuskegee's white benefactors,
                    with <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
          </placeName>'s end of the correspondence couched in the somewhat restrained, dignified,
                    subservient language evidently most conducive to eliciting money from philanthropists. Some letters
                    deal with professional fund raisers employed by Tuskegee and the frustration <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
          </placeName> suffered in endeavoring to find the, right person for this perennially all important
                    academic effort.</p>
        <p>Despite <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
          </placeName>'s extensive absences from the college, his correspondence reveals that he was
                    very much in charge of Tuskegee affairs and in fact appears to have had considerable difficulty in
                    delegating authority. He was extremely attentive to every detail of the college's operation
                    and was by no means reluctant bluntly to chastise his faculty and staff for their real or alleged
                    shortcomings. By virtue of the evidence in this volume Tuskegee must have been a terribly
                    uncomfortable place of employment for anyone even remotely resembling a free spirit.</p>
        <p>Various items in the correspondence include letters to and from Samuel Chapman Armstrong, the founder
                    of Hampton Institute and a definite father figure to <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>

        <p>To write a book about individuals from a given state of the Union who have been important in the
                    making of American foreign policy is perhaps a new approach to the history of the <placeName>
            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
          </placeName>, but it has to be said that in the case of <placeName>
            <region reg="mnu" type="state">Minnesota</region>

          </placeName> the effort has been successful. Many of that state's leaders have excelled in
                    the field of foreign affairs. Half the subjects of <hi rend="i">Ten Men of <placeName>
              <region reg="mnu" type="state">Minnesota</region>
            </placeName>
          </hi> have died, one of them many years ago. The others are still quite active in
                    writing or speaking on foreign affairs, and one of them is yet in the <placeName>
            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
          </placeName> Senate. Cushman K. Davis died shortly after the turn of the century, but not before he
                    had served on the Senate foreign relations committee and been a peace commissioner at <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
          </placeName> in 1898 and stood with his fellow commissioner Whitelaw Reid in favor of taking all of
                    the Philippine Islands. Charles A. Lindbergh, Sr., was a maverick congressman and lawyer, an
                    isolationist. Harold Knutson and Henrik Shipstead served respectively in the House and Senate and
                    championed isolationism through thick and thin. Frank B. Kellogg was a senator, secretary of state
                    in the latter 1920s, and author of the Kellogg Pact for which he received the Nobel peace prize in
                    1930, the very year another Minnesotan, Sinclair Lewis, received the prize for literature. Joseph H.
                    Ball rose like a comet to become senator during the Second World War and an outstanding
                    internationalist, after which his career fell like a stone; and presently he lives on a farm in the
                    Blue Ridge Mountains of <placeName>
            <region reg="vau" type="state">Virginia</region>

          </placeName>, far from the political scenes of his youth. Harold E. Stassen likewise rose quickly to
                    prominence, and then his career was overcome by what generally has been agreed to have been too much
                    ambition; in his last effort for the presidency he received <pb
            id="VAA4025-070-4-085" n="363"/> two
                    votes at the Republican national convention. Congressman Walter E. Judd is now out of Congress and
                    still speaking for Chiang Kai-shek. Senators Hubert H. Humphrey and Eugene J. McCarthy have recently
                    exchanged retirements, with McCarthy out and Humphrey in, but the presidential prospects of both of
                    these able Minnesotans have been shattered, if for different reasons.</p>
        <p>How does one add up the record in <placeName>
            <region reg="mnu" type="state">Minnesota</region>
          </placeName>? It is of course a series of tales of ambition, and such tales are always
                    interesting and usually precautionary. None led its subject to the top national political prize.
                    Some of the tales show individuals of great national promise, but the careers became mortgaged to
                    circumstances, and luck failed. Davis, Knutson, and Shipstead probably were second or third raters.
                    Lindbergh was a fascinating loner, just like his more famous son. Kellogg's career brought
                    high office perhaps too late in life, and in any event he lacked political judgment. Ball and Judd
                    are able apostles but true believers, unable to waver when wavering is called for. Stassen had
                    enormous talents but threw them to the winds. Eugene McCarthy proved himself too unstable for the
                    American people to take him by the hand on anything more than a short walk. There remains Humphrey,
                    about whom every reader will have opinions, and perhaps regrets.</p>
        <p>The author has managed nicely to surround her subjects with the events of their times; she has read
                    wisely and well. She writes clearly. Her judgments are thoughtful without being sententious or
                    didactic and are always fair.</p>

                    professionalism and by its selection but feels the book presents objects and events with little
                    personality. The Indians (p. 48) reflect a Chamber of Commerce brochure rather than their heritage
                    to the state. Little more than Christmas (pp. 154-56) and Rosemaling ("the art of painting
                    roses") involve the rich ethnic mix. One thus feels uncertain if <hi rend="i">A State for

        <p>

          </placeName> "Everyman," viewing life in the collective. Photographic scenes are

                    preserve, and publicize, and should cause the historian to use photographs in interpreting, not
                    embellishing, their works.</p>

        <p>Originally this work was to have been the concluding part of a single volume on <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
          </placeName>'s urban development since 1910. Convinced that such a work would be
                    unmanageable in size and prohibitive in cost, the Depression, that "turning point for the
                    American City—from expansion, confidence, and civic resurgence to economic and cultural
                    decline" (p. xv), was chosen as the dividing line. While the author doubted that the
                    continuity of the text would be "adversely" (p. xv) affected, in fact, it is.
                    Daniel C. Burnham's famous plan of <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
          </placeName>, 1909, serves throughout this volume as the author's reference point, yet
                    nowhere is even the barest sketch of that seminal proposal provided. A short introductory chapter
                    giving background on this and other matters would easily have remedied a grave defect.</p>

        <p>As it is, the first chapter on the planning of the Century of Progress Exposition establishes the
                    theme for all that follows. The Exposition of 1933, a "rainbow city stretched along the
                    blue and shining lake," was architecturally innovative in its inexpensive and rapid
                    construction, use of materials, lighting, and bold use of color. Withal such a financial success
                    that it was repeated in 1934, the Exposition was a <pb
            id="VAA4025-070-4-088" n="366"/> mordant
                    contrast to the "real city, the beaten, hungry impotent <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
          </placeName> behind it" (p. 7).</p>
        <p>In just this way the triumphs of architecture which rose in the core city, fashioned largely by the <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
          </placeName> based firms of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill; Perkins and Will; Harry Weese and
                    Associates; and the great Mies van der Rohe firms, invariably come at the cost of the larger
                    interests of the city. It was as if a family lavished its attention on the appointments of the
                    visitor's parlor and let the rest of the house fall down. Let the <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Hancock</settlement>
          </placeName> Center serve as an example: a marvel of the architect's art, this
                    "braced vertical tubular cantilever"—or "optimum
                    column-diagonal truss tube" (p. 107)—is an ecological disaster; its site a
                    mistake, its size grossly out of scale, its form inharmonious with its neighbors. The beneficiary of
                    "unprincipled zoning" (p. 112) through which the city council granted privileges
                    whenever the investors saw an opportunity to expand profits, its real significance emerged with the
                    competition in corporate advertising it announced and the monstrous Sears Tower it evoked.</p>
        <p>If the core city received beautiful, if often hostile, triumphs, the rest of <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>

          </placeName> got huge urban renewal projects with ugly buildings of inhuman proportions, which,
                    without exception, meant a net loss of poor and middle income housing units. The consequences of the
                    Richard Daley years can be read in the census figures. City population has dropped in the last two
                    censuses to a point below that of 1930. Why? Locally, according to Professor Condit, it
                    was the alert philistinism shared by the mayor and avaricious business interests. On the national
                    scene, urban blight and depopulation is due to the military establishment, "aided by its
                    industrial allies, the political directorate of the federal government, and Congress
                    …" (p. 280). The solution? It is clear that the author intends the
                    starkest pessimism, for only "a radical program of physical and moral reconstruction
                    initiated by the people" (p. 281) will do. This old "change of heart"
                    platform is the weakest and least convincing of the reformer's nostrums. Instructive here
                    is the experience of Vinton W. Bacon, a sanitary engineer called in by Daley in 1963 to clear up the
                    job selling, bribery, kickbacks, altering of Civil Service examination scores, and leasing deals
                    extant in the Sanitary District. So successful was Bacon that he attracted the testimonial <pb
            id="VAA4025-070-4-089" n="367"/> of a dynamite bomb in 1966, which he survived, only to be
                    illegally dismissed by the trustees in a secret meeting- in January, 1970.</p>
        <p>This work is emphatically not a mere liberal jeremiad, however. It is a sober and sometimes technical
                    discussion of land use, schools and universities, highways, railroads, water and waterways, and
                    airports, as well as architecture. Condit, a professor of history, urban affairs, and art history at
                    Northwestern University, has included over one hundred necessary photographs and appended twenty-one
                    pages of tables. Alas, the new Comprehensive Plan of <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
          </placeName>, 1966, is "eyewash" (p. 277). No one says that now about
                    Burnham's effort.</p>
