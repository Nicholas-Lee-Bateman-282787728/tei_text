                <head>PREFACE.</head>
                <p><hi>IN</hi> committing these addresses to the press, I would like to say to my
                    readers that although for months after their delivery I was continually pressed
                    to publish them by many of my hearers, I steadily refused, chiefly because I
                    feared that in cold type they might produce an impression of censoriousness,
                    which was not possible when, as I believe, assisted by the Spirit of God, I
                    dealt with my hearers face to face on these burning topics.</p>
                <p>During my late illness I became deeply convinced that it was my duty to let these
                    utterances, such as they are, go forth irrespective of consequences, in the hope
                    of reaching a greater number of persons similarly circumstanced with those to
                    whom they were originally spoken, many of whom professed to have received great
                    personal blessing, with increased light and power for usefulness.</p>
                <p>Having come to this conclusion, I submitted the MSS. to my friend Commissioner
                    Railton, who not only strongly urged me to publish them, but favoured<pb n="vi" xml:id="VAB7129-002"></pb> me with some most valuable suggestions and
                    emendations.</p>

                    <p><hi>I SUPPOSE</hi> there will be no division of opinion in my audience as to
                        the fact that humanity needs a Christ,âthat everywhere and in all ages, men
                        and women have been, and are still, conscious of a strife with evil; not
                        merely physical evil represented by thorns and thistles, but with moral
                        evilâevil in thought, in intention, in action, both in themselves and in
                        those around them. This consciousness of wrong has thrust upon men the
                        realization of their need of help from some extraneous power, or being. In
                        all generations men have seemed to feel that without such help there must be
                        a perishing.</p>
                    <p>This sense of need has been forced upon men, first, by the failure of their
                        own repeated efforts to help and save themselves.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, by their observation of such fruitless efforts in others.</p>
                    <p>What man or woman who has thought at all, who has not stood on the edge of
                        this human whirlpool, and watched the struggling multitudes as they have
                        risen and sunk, striving and struggling by resolutions, by the embracing of
                        new theories, by taking of pledges,<pb n="4" xml:id="VAB7129-006"></pb> and
                        making new departures, to escape from the evil of their own natures and to
                        save themselves? Who has watched the struggle without realizing the need
                        that some Almighty independent arm should be stretched out to deliver and to
                        save? Who can read history or contemplate the experience of humanity at the
                        present time, without realizing that it needs a Saviour, whatever idea may
                        be entertained as to the kind of Saviour required?</p>
                    <p>Further, this sense of need is the outcome of the filial instinct born in
                        every human soul, which cries out in the hour of distress or danger to an
                        Almighty Father,âa God,âa friend somewhere in the universe, able to help and
                        to deliver. This instinct is at the bottom of all religions, and more or
                        less embodied in all their formulas, from that of the untutored savage up to
                        the profoundest philosopher the world has ever produced. Perhaps the cry of
                        humanity, destitute of a Divine revelation, could not be better summed up
                        than in the following words of Plato, who, speaking of the soul and its
                        destiny, says:â</p>
                    <p>âIt appears to me that to know them clearly in the present life is either
                        impossible or very difficult; on the other hand, not to test what has been
                        said of them in every possible way, not to investigate the whole matter and
                        exhaust upon it every effort, is the part of a very weak man. For we ought
                        in respect to these things, either to learn from others how they stand, or
                        to discover them for ourselves, or, if both these things are impossible,
                        then taking the best of human reasonings, that which appears the best
                        supported, and embarking on that, as one who risks himself on a raftâso to
                        sail through lifeâunless one could be<pb n="5" xml:id="VAB7129-007"></pb>
                        carried more safely, or with less risk, on a secret conveyance, or some
                        Divine Logos.â</p>
                    <p>In this confession, and in that of many others similar, we see, as it were, a
                        mighty soul prying through the gates of life, striving to fathom the
                        mysteries of being and to unlock the unknown future,âin fact, crying out for
                        a Christ, a Divine Word, or Logos, a something or somebody who should guide
                        him, taking him up where human reason and philosophy failed him. It is also
                        worthy of note that it has always been the highest type of man in all ages
                        who has cried out most persistently for an extraneous deliverer. The more
                        conscious of his own powers and the higher in his aspirations man has
                        become, the more vehemently has he sought, outside of himself, for light and
                        deliverance. Surely this universal cry of humanity, in all its phases and
                        throughout all ages, betrays a great want, casting its shadows beforeâthe
                        cry of the creature responding to the purpose of the Creator to send a <emph rend="sc">SAVIOUR</emph> able to save to the uttermost of manâs
                        necessity. The great realized want of humanity was a deliverer who could
                        take away its sense of guilt, enlighten its ignorance, and energise it for
                        the practice of all goodness and truth,âa being who could not only stand
                        without and legislate as to what men were to do, but who could come within
                        and empower them to do it. Heathen philosophies and ancient religions could
                        say, âLove thy neighbor,â but they could none of them inspire the man to do
                        it, much less enable him to love his enemyânone of them even aspired to
                        command that. That was beyond humanity. Here, then, was the great need of a
                        power to come inside and rectify the wrong, makâ<pb n="6" xml:id="VAB7129-008"></pb> ing the spring right, so that its outcome might
                        be right.</p>
                    <p>Further, I want to remark that in the Bible a Christ is offered that meets
                        this need. This is the great distinguishing boast of our faithâthe only
                        religion on the face of the earth in which the idea of a Christ has ever
                        been conceived. The Bible offers this Christ. The golden chimes of great joy
                        that rang out on the day when He was heralded by the angels, were to be glad
                        tidings to all people of a Saviour which was Christ the Lord, a mighty
                        deliverer, able to cope with manâs inability, with the disadvantages of his
                        circumstances, and the consequences of his fall. Now we contend that this
                        Christ of the Bible, the Christ who appeared in Judea 1800 years ago, is now
                        abroad in the earth just as much as He was then, and that He presents to
                        humanity all that it needs; that He is indeed, as He represented Himself to
                        be, the Bread of Life come down from heaven, the Light, and the Life, and
                        the Strength of man, meeting this cry of his soul which has been going up to
                        God for generations. Here I stand and make my boast, that the Christ of God,
                        my Christ, the Christ of the Salvation Army, does meet this crying need of
                        the soul, does fill this aching void, and does become to man that which God
                        sets Him forth as being in this book. Guilty humanity He promises to pardon,
                        and He does pardon. Ignorant humanity (with respect to God and the things of
                        God) He promises to enlighten, and He does enlighten it. Degraded, sunken,
                        impure humanity (in the very essence of its being) He promises to purify,
                        and He does purify it. We make our boast of this Christ, and we say He is
                        able to save to the uttermost, and that<pb n="7" xml:id="VAB7129-009"></pb> He
                        does this now as much as ever He has done in the 1800 years that are
                        past,âthat He is a real, living, present Saviour to those who really receive
                        and put their trust in Him.</p>
                    <p>I know that many may answer, âThis is not the Christ that is generally
                        presented in the preaching and teaching of this age, or that is generally
                        professed and believed in by the Christians of this age; neither do we see
                        such results as you depict in their characters or lives.â Granted. The
                        sceptics and the infidels say: âWe do not see these results, and therefore
                        we do not believe in your Christ.â And I say, looking at the question from
                        their standpoint, I should feel just as they do, because they have a right
                        to have these results proved to them. It is useless telling of wonderful
                        things having transpired a long time ago and a long distance away. They say,
                        Show them now; show us the men in whom this change is wrought, and then we
                        will believe that this Christ always does these things. I say Amen, and that
                        because they do not see these signs in the popular Christianity of this day,
                        therefore they reject its Christ, and there is great excuse for them,ânot
                        such excuse as will justify them at the bar of God, because they ought to
                        have found out Christ for themselves,ânevertheless, an excuse to themselves
                        and to their fellowâmen.</p>
                    <p>I say, I grant that this is not the Christ exhibited in these days.</p>
                    <p>I will now try to give to you, as I perceive them, those modern
                        representations of Christ which, instead of drawing all men unto Him, have
                        driven the great mass away from Him, and disgusted many of the ablest minds
                        with the whole system of existing Christianity.</p>

                    <head>False Christs.</head>
                    <p>The first imaginary Christ of this age seems to be a sort of <emph>religious
                            myth or good angel</emph>âa being of the imagination who lived in the
                        long distance, and who does very well to preach, write, and sing about, or
                        to make pictures about, with which to adorn peopleâs dwellingsâa kind of
                        religious Julius CÃ¦sar, who did wonderful things ages ago, and who is
                        somehow or other going to benefit in the future those who intellectually
                        believe in Him now; but as to helping man in his present need, guilt,
                        bondage, or agony, they never even pretend that He does anything of the
                        kind. This Christ makes no difference in <emph>them</emph> or their
                            <emph>lives</emph>; they live precisely as their neighbors do, only that
                        they profess to believe in this Christ while their neighbors do not.</p>
                    <p>Now this is not the Christ represented in the New Testament. The Christ of
                        God was a real veritable person, who walked about, and taught, and
                        communicated with men; who helped and saved them from their evil appetites
                        and passions, and who promised to keep on doing so to the end of the world;
                        who called His followers to come out from the evil and sin of the world to
                        follow Him, carrying His cross, obeying His words, and consecrating
                        themselves to the same purposes for which He lived and died; seeking always
                        to overcome evil with good, and to breast the swelling tide of human passion
                        and opposition with meekness, patience, and love; promising to be in them an
                        Almighty Divine presence, renovating and renewing the whole man, and
                        empowering them to walk in His footsteps.</p>
                    <pb n="9" xml:id="VAB7129-011"></pb>
                    <p>I am afraid there are thousands who sit in our churches and chapels and hear
                        the modern Christ descanted on, who, if asked their idea of Christ, would be
                        utterly at a loss to give it. They have no definite conception of what His
                        name or being means. They would not like to say whether He is in heaven or
                        on earth. If asked whether He had done anything for them personally, they
                        cannot tell; the most they say is that they hope so, or that they hope He
                        will do something some day. He is to them a mere idea.</p>
                    <p>Another false but very common view of Christ in these days is that He is a
                        sort of <emph>Divine makeâweight</emph>. You will hear people say, when
                        spoken to about their souls, âYes, I know I am very weak and sinful, but I
                        am doing the best I can, and Jesus is my Saviour; He will make up what I
                        lack.â In these instances there is not even the recognition of the necessity
                        of pardon, much less of the power of Christ to renew the soul in
                        righteousness, and to fit it for the holy employments and companionships of
                        heaven. This Christ is simply dragged at the tail, not only of human effort
                        but of human failure, and offered, as it were, in the arms of an impudent
                        presumption, as a make up in the scale of human deserts. And yet how many
                        thousands of church and chapel going people, it is to be feared, are deluded
                        by supposing that this imaginary Christ will meet the needs of their souls
                        before the judgment bar of God.</p>
                    <p>To others this imaginary Christ is only a superior human being, <emph>a
                            beautiful example</emph>âthe most beautiful the world has ever seen; not
                        Divine, yet the nearest to our conception of the Divine which even they
                        think possible, but only human still. This Christ is held up<pb n="10" xml:id="VAB7129-012"></pb> as the embodiment of all that is noble, true,
                        selfâsacrificing and holyâan example of what we are to be, but supplying no
                        power by which to conform ourselves to the model.</p>
                    <p>I frequently find that the people who make so much ado about the example of
                        Christ are the furthest from following it. They say it is not intended to be
                        followed literally. But how else can you imitate any one? How can an example
                        be followed figuratively? Alas! The admirers of this human Christ make it
                        sadly manifest in their lives and experience that humanity needs not only a
                        model, but an inspiring presence to restore its lost balance, energise its
                        feeble faculties, and rekindle its spiritual aspirations. Conceiving only of
                        a human model, the paralysed soul finds no higher source of strength than
                        its own desires and resolutions, and after the oftârepeated experiment at
                        selfâdeliverance, sinks at length overwhelmed with a sense of failure and
                        despair. It is not in man or angel, however sublime, to free the human soul
                        from its fetters of realized guilt, or to empower it for the reconquest of
                        that Eden of righteousness and peace from which the avenging angel of
                        justice once expelled it. A human Christ is only a phantom of the
                        imagination, an <foreign xml:lang="lat" rend="i">ignis fatuus</foreign>.</p>
                    <p>Another modern representation of the Christ is that of a
                            <emph>substitutionary Saviour</emph>,ânot in the sense of atonement
                        merely, but in the way of obedience. This Christ is held up as embodying in
                        Himself the sum and substance of the sinnerâs salvation, needing only to be
                        believed in, that is, accepted by the mind as the atoning Sacrifice, and
                        trusted in as securing for the sinner all the benefits involved in His
                        death, without<pb n="11" xml:id="VAB7129-013"></pb> respect to any inwrought
                        change in the sinner himself.</p>
                    <p>This Christ is held up as a justification and protection in sin, not as a
                        deliverer from sin. Men and women are assured that no harm can overtake them
                        if they believe in this Christ, whatever may be the state of their hearts,
                        or however they may, in their actions, outrage the laws of righteousness and
                        truth.</p>
                    <p>In other words, men are taught that Christ obeyed the law for them, not only
                        as necessary to the efficacy of His atonement for their justification, but
                        that He has placed His obedience in the stead of, or as a substitution for,
                        the sinnerâs own obedience or sanctification, which in effect is like
                        saying, Though you may be untrue, Christ is your truth; though you may be
                        unclean, Christ is your chastity; though you may be dishonest, Christ is
                        your honesty; though you may be insincere, Christ is your sincerity.</p>
                    <p>The outcome of such a faith only produces outwardly the whited sepulchres of
                        profession, while within are rottenness and dead menâs bones. The Christ of
                        God never undertook to perform any such offices for His people, but He did
                        undertake to make them â<emph>new creatures</emph>,â and thus to enable them
                        to perform them for themselves. He never undertook to be true instead of me,
                        but to make me true to the very core of my soul. He never undertook to make
                        me pass for pure, either to God or man, but to enable me to <emph>be</emph>
                        pure. He never undertook to make me pass for honest and sincere, but to
                        renew me in the spirit of my mind so that I could not help but be both, as
                        the result of the operation of His Spirit within me. He never undertook to
                        love God instead of my doing so with âall my heart and<pb n="12" xml:id="VAB7129-014"></pb> mind and soul and strength,â but He came on
                        purpose to empower and inspire me to do this. The idea of a substitutionary
                        Christ accepted as an outward covering or refuge, instead of the power of
                        âan endless life,â is a cheat of the devil, and has been the ruin of
                        thousands of souls. I fear this view of Christ, so persistently preached in
                        the present day, encourages thousands in a false hope while they are living
                        in sin, and consequently under the curse not only of a broken law, but of a
                        Saviour denied and abjured. Let me ask you, my hearers, what sort of a
                        Christ is yours? have you a Christ who <emph>saves you</emph>, who renews
                        your heart, who enables you to live in obedience to God, or are you looking
                        to this outside and imaginary Christ to do your obeying for you?</p>
                    <p>Another false idea of Christ, entertained, I fear, by multitudes of sincere
                        souls, is that of <emph>a Divine condemnation</emph>.</p>
                    <p>This class of people seem to think that they ought to spend all their lives
                        bewailing and bemoaning their sins, and are for ever crying out, âOh,
                        wretched man that I am,â âChrist have mercy on us, miserable sinnersâ; and
                        they go on crying this every day of their lives. They forget that He of whom
                        Moses and the prophets did write, <emph>is come</emph>. They forget that the
                        deliverer is hereâthat pardon is offered, and that He is ready to witness it
                        and fill their souls with peace and joy. If Christ be only for condemnation,
                        what are these poor souls advantaged by His coming? what has He done more
                        than the law did, for them? The law made them realize their bondage, writhe
                        under a sense of their sins, and set them longing after freedom and
                        deliverance. It was their<pb n="13" xml:id="VAB7129-015"></pb> schoolmaster (or
                        should have been) to bring them to ChristâChrist, the Son, who was to make
                        them free; but alas! in this case He is made a much harder schoolmaster than
                        the law itself, for these poor souls get no deliverance, no peace, no joy,
                        or power. They are always piping Paulâs bewailing notes, in which he
                        personified a convicted sinner, struggling under the fetters of
                        condemnation. But they never get into his triumphant notes, where he
                        declares, âthere is now no condemnation.â</p>
                    <p>This false view of Christ has led to most of the idolatries, penances, and
                        lacerations of Catholicism.</p>
                    <p>The exhibition of a Christ too unsympathetic and implacable to be approached
                        without a second intercessorâa farâoff, austere judge, rather than a
                        pitying, pardoning Saviourâhas kept millions of poor souls in bondage all
                        their lives. I must say, however, that I have more sympathy with such souls,
                        because they <emph>are</emph> sincere, and earnest, and willing to deny
                        themselves, in order to find the right way, than with those who
                        thoughtlessly take refuge under any of the false representations of Christ
                        to which we have referred. It is to be feared, however, that the same spirit
                        of worldliness which has so largely destroyed the power of Protestantism,
                        has, to a great extent, extinguished this groping after Christ in the
                        Catholic Church. I confess that I cannot see sufficient cause for
                        congratulations such as are common in Protestant circles over the decadence
                        of Popery, seeing that everybody knows that it is not in consequence of a
                        growth of real heavenly light, but only the further spread of a careless,
                        godless, takeâitâeasy spirit, putting out the earnest desire for
                        purification which formerly led to so much selfâsacrifice in<pb n="14" xml:id="VAB7129-016"></pb> the church of Rome. There can be no doubt that it
                        is through the loss of this true spirit of devotion that the evils which
                        have crept into that Church have so completely overâshadowed the good, and
                        prevented the multiplication of St. Bernards and others who got through the
                        selfâdespair into the purest light and joy. Still, there are many earnest
                        souls left, who continue to cry over their sins as though no deliverer had
                        come. The Christ of God came not to bring condemnation but pardon, peace,
                        and gladness to every penitent sinner on the face of the earth. I heard, the
                        other day, a story which beautifully illustrates this: A poor Catholic
                        woman, who had been in bondage all her life to a sense of guilt, and had
                        earnestly sought by all the methods prescribed by her Church, especially by
                        devotion to the Virgin Mary, to find peace and deliverance, when on her
                        deathâbed was brought into contact with one who had in reality found the
                        Christ of God, and who was enabled to show to this poor trembling soul the
                        sufficiency of His sacrifice, and His willingness to pardon and to purify.
                        Through the influence of the Spirit of God which accompanied this exhibition
                        of the true Christ, she was enabled to rest her soul on Him, and immediately
                        entered into rest. Shortly afterwards her priest presented himself at her
                        bedside, when she accosted him with the words, âOh, you are too late, too
                        late, I have found a better Priest than you, and He has absolved me. I am
                        happy, happy, happy!â</p>
                    <p>The Christ of God is not a condemnatory Christ, but a pitying, pardoning
                        Saviour, calling to His bosom the weary and heavy laden in all ages.</p>
                    <p>Another of these false views of Christ is that which<pb n="15" xml:id="VAB7129-017"></pb> presents Him as <emph>a future deliverer, without
                            being a present Saviour</emph>.</p>
                    <p>It is to be feared that thousands are looking to Him to save them from the
                        consequences of sinâthat is, hell,âwho continue to commit sin; they utterly
                        misunderstand the aim and work of the Christ of God. They do not see that He
                        came not merely to bring men to heaven, but to bring them back into harmony
                        with His Father; they look upon the atonement as a sort of makeâshift plan
                        by which they are to enter heaven, leaving their characters unchanged on
                        earth. They forget that sin is a far greater evil in the Divine estimation
                        than hell; they do not see that sin is the primal evil. If there were no sin
                        there need be no hell. God only proposed to save people from the
                        consequences of sin by saving them from the sin itself; and this is the
                        great distinguishing work of Christâto <emph>save His people from their
                            sins!</emph></p>

                    <p>Now I deny that any of the representations of Christ to which I have referred
                        are the Bible representations of the Christ of God, or that they meet the
                        need of the soul of man. They are for the most part made to meet the ideas
                        of a modern worldly Christianity.</p>
                    <p>Men have made up their minds that they can possess and enjoy all they can get
                        of this world in common with their fellowâmen, and yet get to heaven at
                        last. They have made up their minds that it is all nonsense about following
                        the Christ,âbecoming a laughing stock to the world, which He made Himself
                        every day He lived,âand setting themselves to live a holy life, which He
                        said if they did not they were none of His;<pb n="16" xml:id="VAB7129-018"></pb>
                        all this they have abandoned as an impossibility, and yet, not content
                        without a religion, and finding it impossible to look into the future
                        without a hope of some sort, they have manufactured a Christ to meet their
                        views, and spun endless theories to match the state of their hearts. The
                        worst of all, however, is that a great many of the teachers of Christianity
                        have adopted these theories, and spend their whole lives in misrepresenting
                        the Christ of the gospel.</p>
                    <p>Now let me try to put before you what I conceive to be the true
                        representation of the Christ of God. We say that He meets the whole worldâs
                        needâthat He comes to it walking on the waves of its difficulties, sins, and
                        sorrows, and says, âI am the Bread of Life; take Me, appropriate Me, live by
                        Me, and you will live for ever. I will resuscitate and pardon, cleanse and
                        energise you; I am the Christ, the Saviour of the world.â This is the Divine
                        âWord,â or deliverer, which philosophers have longed for, and stretched out
                        their dying hands to embraceâwhich all the heathen world have, more or less,
                        groped after in some dim figure.</p>
                    <p>First: <emph>The Christ of God is Divine</emph>.</p>
                    <p>We admit the incarnation was a mystery, looked at from a human standpoint,
                        but no greater mystery than many other incarnations taking place all around
                        us, and because a mystery, none the less a necessity. Humanity must have a
                        deliverer <emph>able to save</emph>, and no less than an Almighty deliverer
                        was equal to the task. Here, all merely human deliverers, all philosophers
                        and teachers of the world, had failed, because they could only teach, they
                        could not <emph>renew</emph>. They could set up a standard, enunciate a
                        doctrine, but they could not remove manâs inability, or endue him with power
                            to<pb n="17" xml:id="VAB7129-019"></pb> reach it. Here even the law of God
                        failed, and that which was ordained to life wrought death. Here was the
                        sunken rock, the bitter maddening failure of all systems and
                        deliverers,âthey failed to <emph>rectify the heart</emph>; they could not
                        give a new life or impart another spirit.</p>
                    <p>We saw at the outset that man needed some being outside of himself, above
                        him, and yet able to understand and pity him in his utmost guilt, misery,
                        and helplessnessâable to inspire in him with <emph>a new life</emph>, to
                        impart light, love, strength, and endurance, and to do this always and
                        everywhere, in every hour of darkness, temptation, and danger. Humanity
                        needed an exhibition of God, not merely to be told about Him, but to
                            <emph>see</emph> Him; not merely to know that He was an Almighty
                        Creator, able to crush him, but that He is a pitiful Father, yearning and
                        waiting to save him. Godâs expedient for showing this to man was to come in
                        the flesh. Can the wisest modern philosopher or the most benevolent
                        philanthropist conceive a better? How otherwise could God have revealed
                        Himself to fallen man? Since the fall man has proved himself incapable of
                        seeing or knowing God; he has ever been afraid of the heavenly, running away
                        even from an angel; and when only hearing a voice and seeing the smoke which
                        hid the divinity, he exceedingly feared and quaked, and begged not to hear
                        that voice again. Truly, no man as he is by nature can see God and live.
                        Seeing then, that God desired that man should see Himâthat is, know Himâand
                        live, notwithstanding his fall, He promised a Saviour, who should reveal Him
                        in all the holiness and benevolence of His character, and in His plenitude
                        of power to save!</p>

                    <p>Here the Christ of God presents Himself, claiming to be this Divine Saviour.
                        An objector may ask for proof of His Divinity. This would be far too great a
                        subject to go into now, but we may glance at two or three considerations,
                        which are quite sufficient, unless, indeed, Christ were an imposter.</p>
                    <p>First, those who reject His Divinity say He is the nearest to the Divine of
                        anything we can conceive. They say He is the best of the good of our
                        raceâeven infidels cannot find fault with His character; they all bow down
                        before the spotless purity, the beneficence and moral beauty of Jesus
                        Christ. All schools grant this. Then, taking my stand here, I say that this
                        perfect being <emph>claimed to be Divine</emph>, and He claimed it so
                        unmistakably and persistently, that if you take it out of His teachings, you
                        reduce them to a jumble of inconsistencies. His Divinity is the central fact
                        around which all His doctrines and teaching revolve, so that if this be
                        extinguished, they become like a system of astronomy without the sun, dark,
                        conflicting, and inconsistent. Read the Gospels and illiminate for
                        yourselves all His assumptions of Divinity, and then see what you can make
                        of His teaching.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, these assumptions were understood and resented by the people to
                        whom He spoke, and they surely were the best judges as to what He meant. If
                        they had mistaken His meaning, He was bound, merely as a man of honour, to
                        explain Himself, but He never did; so when the Jews said, âWhom makes Thou
                        Thyself,â or, âThis man maketh himself equal with God,â He did not demur nor
                        retract, but repeated, âI came forth from the Father, and I go to the
                        Father.â This was the one intolerable point in His<pb n="19" xml:id="VAB7129-021"></pb> teaching, which the Jews, who owned no plurality
                        in gods, could not endure; that any other being should be one with their
                        Jehovah was to them insufferable, and for this they ultimately crucified
                        Him. âWhat further need have we,â said the high priest, âof witnesses?
                        Behold, now ye have heard His blasphemy.â</p>
                    <p>Then, if He were so near an approach to perfection as even infidels admit,
                        how was it that He allowed such an impression of His teachings to go abroad,
                        if He were not Divine? How could He say, âIf ye believe not that I am He, ye
                        shall die in your sins,â if He had not known Himself to be the Christ of
                        God?</p>
                    <p>Thirdly, His character supported His assumptions. For 1800 years millions of
                        the best of the human race have accepted these assumptions without being
                        shocked by them. If He be not Divine, how comes it to be that the greatest
                        of human intellects, the sincerest of human souls, and the most aroused and
                        anxious of human consciences, have ventured their all upon this Divine word,
                        and have seen nothing contradictory between His claims and the actual
                        character which He sustained in the world; whereas, imagine the very holiest
                        and best who ever trod our earth putting forth such assumptions, and how
                        would they sound! Suppose Moses, who had talked with God in the burning
                        bush, or Isaiah, whose tongue was touched with the live coal from off the
                        altar, or Daniel, the man greatly beloved, to whom the angel Gabriel was
                        sent again and again, or the apostle of the Gentiles, who was admitted into
                        the third heaven, or the beloved apostle John,âsuppose any of these men
                        saying, âI am from above, ye are from beneath,â âI am not of this world,â
                        âIf ye believe not I am He, ye shall die in your sins.â âI came<pb n="20" xml:id="VAB7129-022"></pb> forth from the Father, and am come into the
                        world.â Again, âI leave the world and go to the Fatherâ; and in His prayer
                        on the eve of His agony, âThe glory which I had with the Father before the
                        world was,â and again, in answer to Philipâs request, âShow us the
                        Father,âââHave I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known Me?
                        he that hath seen me hath seen the Father;â âbelievest thou not that I am in
                        the Father, and the Father in Me?â</p>
                    <p>And not only does He claim this oneness of essence with the Father, but also
                        that omniscience which enables Him not only to be with His people but to
                        dwell in them, as shown in His answer to the question of Judas, when he
                        asked how it was that He would manifest Himself to His own people and not to
                        the world. Jesus answered, âIf a man love Me, he will keep My words: and My
                        Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with
                        him.â</p>
                    <p>Think of any creatureâa David, a Paul, a John, daring to claim from himself
                        this omniscience. If this Christ were not Divine, then there is no
                        alternative; he was altogether an imposter and a deceiver.</p>
                    <p>From such a conclusion, however, even infidels and blasphemers shrink, and
                        therefore we must be allowed to hold to our faith in our Divine Redeemerâour
                        Immanuel, âGod with us.â I may ask here, if there is one of my hearers whose
                        consciousness does not tell him that he needs a Divine Saviour? Would any
                        less than an Almighty, omniscient, infinite deliverer meet the needs of your
                        souls? If so, you must feel much better and stronger, and more able to help
                        yourselves than I do. âGreat is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest
                        in the flesh, justified in<pb n="21" xml:id="VAB7129-023"></pb> the Spirit, seen
                        of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up
                        into glory.â</p>
                    <p>But take this mystery out of Christianity, and the whole system utterly
                        collapses. Without a Divine Christ Christianity sinks into a mere system of
                        philosophy, and becomes as powerless for the renovation and salvation of
                        mankind as any of the philosophies which have preceded it. But no, our
                        Joshua has come, our Deliverer is here; He is come, and is now literally
                        fulfilling His promise to abide, âI and my Father will come unto you, and
                        make our abode with you.â He comes now in the flesh of His true saints, just
                        as really as He came first in the body prepared for Him, and He comes for
                        the same purpose, to renew and to save; He is knocking at the doors of your
                        hearts even now, through my feeble words, and will come into your hearts if
                        you will let Him. As He came walking over the sea of Galilee to the men and
                        women of His own day, He comes now to you, walking over the storm raised by
                        your appetites, your inordinate desires, passions, and sinsâa storm only
                        just gathering, waxing worse and worse, and which, unless allayed, will grow
                        to eternal thundering, lightnings, and billows; but He is able to allay it,
                        He offers to pronounce âPeace, be still,â and end this tempest of your soul
                        for ever. Will you let Him?</p>
                    <p>Second: The Christ of God offered Himself as a <emph>sacrifice for the sin of
                            man.</emph></p>
                    <p>The Divine law had been broken; the interests of the universe demanded that
                        its righteousness should be maintained, therefore its penalty must be
                        endured by the transgressor, or, in lieu of this, such compensation must be
                        rendered as would satisfy the claims of<pb n="22" xml:id="VAB7129-024"></pb>
                        justice, and render it expedient for God to pardon the guilty. We will not
                        attempt to go into the various theories respecting the atonement; it is
                        enough for us to know that Christ made such a sacrifice as rendered it
                        possible for God to be just, and yet to pardon the sinner. His sacrifice is
                        never represented in the Bible as having purchased or begotten the love of
                        the Father, but only as having opened a channel through which that love
                        could flow out to His rebellious and prodigal children. The doctrine of the
                        New Testament on this point is not that âGod so hated the world that His own
                        Son was compelled to die in order to appease His vengeance,â as we fear has
                        been too often represented, but that âGod so <emph rend="sc">LOVED</emph>
                        the world, the He <emph>gave</emph> His only begotten Son.â</p>
                    <p>As Christ represented His union with the Father as perfect and entire on
                        every point and in every particular of His humiliation, so He represents it
                        as equally complete with respect to the sufficiency and vicarious character
                        of His death. â<emph rend="sc">THEREFORE</emph> doth My Father love Me,
                        because I lay down My life, that I might take it again. No man taketh it
                        from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it down, and I
                        have power to take it again.â</p>
                    <p>He so shows that in baring His won heart to the sword of justice, He was
                        equally with the Father interested in the maintenance of the dignity of the
                        law, and equally inspired with boundless and quenchless love for its
                        transgressors.</p>
                    <p>There has been a great deal of empty talk as to the needlessness of a
                        vicarious sacrifice, and many contend that the Fatherâs love flows out to
                        all His creatures<pb n="23" xml:id="VAB7129-025"></pb> independently of any such
                        intervention; but, setting aside the requirements of the Divine law
                        altogether, I venture to assert that there has never been a human conscience
                        awakened in any measure to the deserts of sin, which has not instinctively
                        felt the need of such a sacrifice. In thousands of instances, even with the
                        strongest representations of the infinity, value, and efficacy of the
                        atonement, it requires the utmost effort to get the trembling soul to rest
                        its hopes on the merit of even this Divine sacrifice, and all history proves
                        that in no other way have sinful consciences <emph>ever been able to find
                            rest</emph>.</p>
                    <p>Third: The Christ of God is an <emph>accepted sacrifice</emph>.</p>
                    <p>This has been attested by His resurrection from the dead. God has declared to
                        the three worlds, of angels, men, and devils, that justice is satisfied, and
                        that henceforth no guilty son or daughter of Adam need despair of His mercy
                        and salvationâthe accepted sacrifice for all men, and we know not for what
                        other beings. How farâreaching its benefits are we cannot tell,âperhaps to
                        distant planets and suns; any way, they reach to you and to me.</p>
                    <p>In view of this sacrifice God waits to pardon your guilt, cleanse your
                        pollution, transform your character, and hallow, and beautify, and utilize
                        your life. You have no longer any excuse for groaning under the dominion of
                        sin. He calls you forth from the tomb of your depravity; He calls you out of
                        the dungeon of your guilt, and offers you a full and free acquittal, with
                        all the resources necessary for a new life of righteousness, peace, and joy
                        in the Holy Ghost.</p>
                    <p>Fourth: The Christ of God is an <emph>embodiment of His Fatherâs
                            righteousness</emph>.</p>
                    <pb n="24" xml:id="VAB7129-026"></pb>
                    <p>He will only administer the benefits of His sacrifice in accordance with the
                        Divine standard of right. He will do no violence either to the government of
                        God or the nature of man. Although love was the supreme ingredient of His
                        character, yet we hear no words of an indiscriminate charity dropping from
                        His lips, no excuse of sin, no palliation of the guilt of enlightened
                        transgressors of His Fatherâs forbearance. He hated iniquity as supremely as
                        He loved righteousness. The great end and aim of His coming was the
                        regeneration and restoration of man to the mind and will of God; hence He
                        confirmed the first and greatest commandment, âThou shalt love the Lord thy
                        God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and
                        with all thy strength.â</p>
                    <p>Fifth: The Christ of God claims to be the <emph>Sovereign of all whom He
                            saves</emph>. He tells us, if men keep not His wordsâdo not obey
                        Himâthey are none of His; and He claims absolute inward and outward
                        obedience to His precepts every hour of every day of all the life of every
                        one who professes to be His subject.</p>
                    <p>My friends, have you accepted Christ? Do you know Him as your Divine Almighty
                        Deliverer from the strength and power of sin? Have you cast your weary soul
                        on Him as your sacrifice, claiming freedom from the condemnation of the
                        past? Have you the witness of His Spirit that this sacrifice has been
                        accepted by God on your behalf, and does the answering cry, âAbba, Father,â
                        go up from your soul? Are you living in the regeneration of His Spirit,
                        carefully seeking to fulfill all righteousness, commending your every act to
                        Him in faithful obediâ<pb n="25" xml:id="VAB7129-027"></pb> ence? Does He reign
                        over you as the sovereign of your heart and life, and do you hold everything
                        you possess,âyourself, your children, your property, your time, your
                        influence, your reputation, your life, your death,âsubservient to His will
                        and interests? If so, happy are you, and your example before men and your
                        influence in the world will be worthy of the professed followers of the
                        âChrist of God.â</p>

                    <p><emph rend="sc">I SUPPOSE</emph> that most of those present this afternoon
                        are aware that the subject is âA mock salvation in comparison with Christâs
                        salvationââdeliverance from sin. As I said last week with respect to a
                        Christian, so I may say this week with respect to salvation, that there will
                        be no difference of opinion as to the need of our race for a salvation of
                        some sort. This must be too patent to need argument,âthat our world is
                        disordered, disjointed, morally diseased, and that it needs some sort of
                        regenerating, rectifying process, if society is not to be disorganised by
                        its own corruptions, or sunk for ever in the hell of its iniquities. Every
                        man knows this to his own hurt. All men have a personal consciousness of
                        being wrong, whether they believe in a Divine revelation or not; nay,
                        whether they believe in God or not. I do not think I have spoken to more
                        than half a dozen people in my lifeâand I have spoken, I suppose, to some
                        thousands of different classesâwho have maintained that they were right.
                        Even infidels, when you face them with the question, âAre you right? are you
                        living according to the dictates of your judgment and conscience?â dare not
                        say they are. The universal cry of our poor humanity is, âOh, wretched man
                        that I am!â whether it be looking for any Divine<pb n="30" xml:id="VAB7129-030"></pb> deliverance or not. Men everywhere know that they
                        are not living according to their own conceptions of right, and therefore
                        they have a sense of selfâcondemnation; and this asserts itself in spite of
                        their arguments and excuses. It is of no avail to the soul tormented with a
                        sense of guilt to say, âThe woman tempted me,â or âI was under the pressure
                        of great fear, or shame, or dreadâ; this is no real palliation. Hence the
                        universal fear to face the future, the disinclination to think about God,
                        the predisposition to blind the eyes to the proofs of His existence, and to
                        harden the heart against His claims. Truly conscience makes cowards of us
                        all until cleansed from dead works, purified and restored to the throne of
                        the soul.</p>
                    <p>Further: not only do all men feel this sense of wrong in themselves, but they
                        expect wrong in others. Even parents anticipate and provide for it in their
                        children. Every parent knows that there is a tendency in his children to go
                        astray from the very first moment of accountability. He knows that there is
                        in his child a tendency to speak lies as soon as it can speak at all, that
                        there is a tendency to perverse tempers and wicked passions. Hence wise
                        parents universally recognise, whether they make any pretensions to
                        Christianity or not, the necessity of family government and careful training
                        in order to check, counteract, or eradicate, as the case may be, these
                        tendencies to evil; and thus they acknowledge the necessity for a certain
                        kind of salvation in their children, and they recognise also this fact, that
                        if they do not attempt to work out this salvation, the children will bring
                        them to wreck and ruin. A child left to itself brings its mother to shame;
                        we know that sadly too well.</p>
                    <pb n="31" xml:id="VAB7129-031"></pb>
                    <p>There is the same recognition of the need of a salvation amongst men of the
                        world. Every intelligent business man goes on the assumption that he has to
                        encounter wrong in the hearts and conduct of his neighbors; in fact, the
                        world takes it as a sign of intelligence that a business man goes on this
                        assumption, and would call him a fool if he did not. He knows that he is
                        beset on all hands by those who will overâreach, cheat, and ruin him for
                        anything that they care, if they can promote their own interests by so
                        doing. Hence the necessity for a kind of legal salvation, in the form of
                        agreements and bonds, between man and man.</p>
                    <p>I hear a good deal about this in connection with our negotiations for
                        buildings, which we are carrying on every day. When proprietors and agents
                        have made certain offers or promises, the General says, âHave you got it in
                        black and white?â and if the answer is âNo,â then he says, âWhat is the use
                        of it?â Alas! We know only too well that it is of no use; and I am sorry to
                        say that this is as true of many professing Christians as of worldly men.
                        Why is this? Because a manâs word is nothing in the great majority of
                        instances. Hence the necessity for lawyers, magistrates, and judges; and
                        even these have to be tied down by law, and watched and supervised, lest
                        even the judges should turn traitors to justice, and, for the sake of bribes
                        or party considerations, sell the interests of those whom they ought to
                        protect. Here again is the recognition of the necessity for a
                            <emph>salvation</emph> for these very people who are placed as guardians
                        of public justice and the administrators of the law. This salvation many of
                        them specially<pb n="32" xml:id="VAB7129-032"></pb> require when dealing with
                        the poor Salvation Army. By the way, it is a curious fact that such is the
                        impression produced by the Army, that again and again politicians on both
                        sides of the Atlantic have laughingly represented various combinations of
                        statesmen as âsalvation armies.â How often do politicians in different lands
                        represent their countries as being, in some particular verging on ruin, and
                        needing a âsalvationâ? What is this but a great public confession, made by
                        those best capable of judging, that whole nations are misled? for in these
                        days of popular government most people have to be cajoled into voting, to
                        their own injury. Moreover, we have it from the highest public authority
                        that nation after nation goes astray on questions vitally affecting their
                        highest good; and it is commonly asserted that they are deliberately led
                        astray by men who care only for their own interests, and so contrive to
                        delude their fellowâmen wholesale.</p>
                    <p>It is evident that but for these temporal salvations to which I have alluded,
                        the world would be unendurable for us to live in. You know this. You know
                        that it is not safe for a man to trust his brother; âfor there is none
                        upright among men, ... they hunt every man his brother with a net.â</p>
                    <p>Here, then, is the patent, palpable necessity for a salvation. Now, the
                        question is, What sort of salvation meets the necessities of the case? What
                        kind of a salvation does God our Maker, who knows what He meant us to be at
                        the first, and who knows perfectly what we have become through sin,âwhat
                        kind of a salvation does <emph>HE</emph> propose for humanity?</p>
                    <pb n="33" xml:id="VAB7129-033"></pb>
                    <p>I answer, He proposes a salvation that deals with and removes the
                            <emph>cause</emph> of all this wrong and woe.</p>
                    <p>Our Saviour, in Matthew xv. 19, goes to the root of the evil when He says:
                        âFor out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries,
                        fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies.â And the apostle also, in
                        Galatians v. 19: âNow the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these;
                        adultery, fornication, uncleanliness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft,
                        hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings,
                        murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you
                        before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things
                        shall not inherit the kingdom of God.â Whether you believe in the revelation
                        or not, you will agree with the fact that these are the works coming
                        everywhere from the evil heart of man; there is no getting away from that.
                        Then I say that God proposes to deal with and remove the
                        <emph>cause</emph>âthe wrong state of the heart. If all menâs hearts could
                        be set right toâday, we should need no more temporal, legal, or political
                        salvations; no more lawyers, police, magistrates, or judges; for a salvation
                        that renews the heart would render all these unnecessary.</p>
                    <p>Godâs plan of salvation in dealing with the internal malady embraces all its
                        external consequences.</p>
                    <p>It is evident, then, that any salvation which does <emph>not</emph> deal with
                        this leprosy of evil in the heart is a mockery.</p>
                    <p>As I showed last week that there are, alas, many false, delusive,
                        disappointing christs; so I have to show this week that there are many
                        makeâbelieve, mock salvations, which only deceive, disappoint, and<pb n="34" xml:id="VAB7129-034"></pb> damn those who trust in them. As I walk about the
                        world, and as I look at professing Christians, my soul crys: O God, make
                        haste to help us to raise up a holy people, in order to show the world what
                        salvation really means, for they do not know. They are utterly befogged and
                        bewildered, and I do not wonder.</p>
                    <p>We will now look at a few of these mock salvations, for they are legion.
                        First, I want to premise that anything, no matter how valuable in itself,
                            <emph>which is put in the place of something for which it is no
                            substitute is a mockery</emph>. For instance, here is a stone, very
                        valuable in its right placeâespecially if it be in one of the shops in
                        Oxford Street; but offered to a starving man in a desert it is a mockery;
                        because, valuable as it is, the man cannot eat it, and he will die
                        notwithstanding that stone, worth a thousand pounds, lies at his feet,
                        because there is no substitute for bread.</p>
                    <p>Now, there are endless substitutions for salvation. It has been the devilâs
                        plan from the beginning to make imitations of Godâs best things. Perhaps it
                        is a necessity that evil must try its power upon all Godâs creatures as it
                        did upon Adam; we do not know. Probably there was no other way or working
                        out the transcendant value and beauty of goodness that by allowing it to
                        come in contact with evil; if this be so, of course it applies to Godâs
                        remedies for sin; anyway, the devil has done his worst on these. Godâs plan
                        of salvation is at present in this crucible. The devil is trying to
                        circumvent it, and his favourite plan for doing this is by forging plenty of
                        mockeries.</p>
                    <p>We will look at these under four divisions,â<emph>Salvations of theory;
                            salvations of ceremony; salvations of mere belief</emph>, and <emph>the
                            salvation of unbelief</emph>.</p>
                    <pb n="35" xml:id="VAB7129-035"></pb>
                    <p>First, let us look at salvations of theory. You see it matters very little
                        what kind of a theory a man has; if it be substituted for salvation it
                        becomes a mockery,âa true theory no less than a false one.</p>
                    <p>The devil no doubt has a correct theory; I fancy that he is a much better
                        theologian than many Christians, but he remains the old serpent still.</p>
                    <p>It is doubtless better to have right opinions that wrong ones, but the best
                        opinions will not save man. I am afraid there is a great deal of preaching
                        that amounts to a mere putting of the different theories about salvation,
                        instead of persuading men to come to Christ and be saved.</p>
                    <p>The main idea of much of the preaching of this day seems to be that of
                        teaching peopleâinstructing them,âwhich too often results in hardening their
                        hearts, and finding them an easier way down to perdition than they would
                        have found without it. Unfortunately a man feels more comfortable when he
                        has been to a place of worship and heard a fine theory <emph>about</emph>
                        salvation, than he would if he had not been, although he may be no nearer
                        being saved. All preaching, Sunday School teaching, tract writing and
                        distribution, or any other instrumentally which has not for its end the
                        immediate salvation of the people, only leads them to trust in mere
                        teaching, which is a mockery. It is like giving a dissertation on the
                        relative value of a vegetarian and an animal diet to a man dying of hunger.
                        What good will your dissertation do unless you get the man to eat of the
                        food about which you are descanting. And, unless your teaching induces men
                        and women to eat of the Bread of life for themselves, it is a mockery! And
                        yet how few preachers or teachers, how few<pb n="36" xml:id="VAB7129-036"></pb>
                        religious workers have this as their main ideaâthe end at which they aim.
                        You can see the want of it in the way they fail to bring men to Christ there
                        and then. How my heart has ached over this aimless, pointless preaching, I
                        could not express. Perhaps, when I have had the rare opportunity of a
                        Sundayâs rest, I have gone to some near place of worship, hoping to be
                        refreshed or stimulated, and to see sinners saved, or at least convicted,
                        but alas! I could only weep as I listened to dissertations on some creed or
                        doctrine which had probably been believed and approved by everybody present
                        since they were children, while the poor empty <emph>souls</emph> were left
                        starving for want. I have felt like saying to the minister, âMy brother, if
                        you have nothing better than this to offer, let us have a prayer meeting and
                        get something direct from the great Father himself, without your
                        intervention.â Would to God there were more preachers in the fix of a
                        Baptist minister in a town where we are just now having a glorious work, who
                        has been so stirred up and awakened to his responsibilities, that, on a
                        recent occasion when he had read his text, he broke down, weeping, which had
                        more effect than all the sermons he had preached during the years he had
                        been in that town. His people wept too, and many of them got converted over
                        again. I wish that a few thousands of the ministers of this kingdom could be
                        brought to a similar state of mind before next Sunday; what a commotion
                        there would be in the land, and what a stir in hell, ah, and in the heavens
                        too!</p>
                    <p>But further, I want you to note that any theory which teaches people to rest
                        in a mere <emph>intellectual belief in the Scriptures</emph>, or any
                        doctrines therein, while<pb n="37" xml:id="VAB7129-037"></pb> their souls are
                        left in bondage to sin, is a mockery, and it is one of the most popular
                        mockeries of this day.</p>
                    <p>Oh, Christians say, âScatter the word,â and they have been scattering the
                        word for generations, spending thousands of pounds over it, and I could
                        enlighten them as to what becomes of the word in thousands of instances when
                        it <emph>is</emph> scattered. We always get wrong when we depart from Godâs
                        way, and this is not His way. It is not written that âit pleased God to save
                        by the distribution of Testaments, those who believe,â but it pleased God to
                        save by the foolishness of preachingâby the living testimony of living
                        menâby those who embody the word in their experience and lives, and then go
                        and speak it in the power of the Spirit to others. This is the sort of
                        preaching God has commanded. Study and love the written word as much as you
                        like, but remember that the letter killeth, and that you will never save men
                        by merely giving them the letter; and I point to the miserable results of
                        this plan as proof of the truth of what I say.</p>
                    <p>I fear the giving away of texts and tracts has proved a most successful
                        stratagem of Satanâs for enabling Christians to salve their consciences in
                        resisting the Spiritâs urgings to a bold, straightâforward testimony for
                        Christ. It is so much easier politely to hand one of these silent
                        messengers, than to make a determined onslaught on the sinnerâs conscience,
                        and to try to persuade him there and then to flee from the wrath to come.
                        Not only is it easier for the Christian, but it is also much more endurable
                        for the unsaved; consequently he is willing to make a compromise, and in
                        order to escape from straight, plain, personal dealing,<pb n="38" xml:id="VAB7129-038"></pb> he will pocket a tract, laughing in his sleeve at
                        the cowardice of the giver; because he knows perfectly well that Christians,
                        to be consistent with what they profess, ought to make a desperate effort
                        for the immediate salvation of every unsaved man and woman with whom they
                        come in contact. The world wants living epistles who will live, weep, act,
                        suffer, and, if need be, die before the people. The testimony of such
                        witnesses will prove a living word indeed, sharper than any twoâedged
                        sword.</p>
                    <p>I say that the knowledge of and belief in this whole Bible, from beginning to
                        end, if substituted for actual, personal salvation, will prove as great a
                        mockery as any other sentimental belief.</p>
                    <p>No mere intellectual beliefs can save men, because right opinions do not make
                        right hearts. Alas, we all know the little practical effect opinions have on
                        character. Look around you. Do you know any man who is not a thorough
                        intellectual believer in chastity being better for a man, or a woman, in the
                        end, than uncleanness? Is there any wicked, profligate young man, whom if
                        you could take him aside and talk fairly to him, would not tell you that he
                        believed that chastity was the best for a man, and yet you have only to look
                        at him to see that he is a sepulchre of uncleanness and debauchery. What
                        avails his intellectual belief in chastity while he is the slave of his
                        lusts? What better is the man who believes in chastity and sins, than a man
                        who does not believe in chastity and sins? As a French infidel, answering a
                        caviller against holiness, said the other day, âYou believe and sin, I do
                        not believe and sin: where is the difference? It seems to me I am the better
                        of the two.â Exactly, for<pb n="39" xml:id="VAB7129-039"></pb> however true or
                        grand a manâs beliefs, of what use are they if he does not act them out?
                        âCan faith save him?â Nay, verily, but <emph>such</emph> a faith
                            <emph>can</emph> damn him.</p>
                    <p>Further, any theory which <emph>leads men to suppose that they are
                            safe</emph> without being actually saved is the most dreadful of
                        all.</p>
                    <p>Such a theory adds an intellectual opiate to the deceit of the heart, and
                        prevents the truth from troubling the conscience. Now, the only use of
                        appealing to the understandings of the unregenerate, is, that through their
                        understandings you may get at their hearts, but if Satan has âblinded their
                        mindsâ by some intellectual opiate, there is no chance. The understanding is
                        darkened, the conscience seared, and the soul paralysed. These are the worst
                        people in the world to preach to; when I had to preach to them, how I
                        groaned many a time for a congregation of heathen. I have found such now in
                        the Salvation ArmyâI mean, a people whose understandings are not darkened by
                        these false theories and intellectual conceits. One <emph>can</emph> get the
                        light in through their heads into their hearts, and this is the reason of
                        our success with them; and is not this the reason why the publicans and the
                        harlots have always gone into the kingdom of God, while the natural children
                        of the kingdom have been left out?</p>
                    <p>A man is either saved or not; the <emph>fact</emph> is independent of his
                        theory, and it is of comparatively little consequence what his theory may be
                        if he be saved. Hence many savages and Catholics have rejoiced in a
                        consciousness of pardon, while many evangelicals have never known it. A man
                        is either under the dominion of sin, or else he is delivered from it. If he
                        is under<pb n="40" xml:id="VAB7129-040"></pb> the dominion of sin, what an awful
                        theory is that which makes him believe he is saved. Could the devil have
                        invented a more damning theory than that? And yet, alas! alas! he allures
                        millions to destruction through it, who otherwise would take alarm and being
                        to seek salvation. He says to all the qualms of conscience and the pangs of
                        remorse, âYou are all right, you believe this or the other, your faith is
                        orthodox, you are safe,â frequently quoting separated or mutilated texts to
                        back up his lying insinuations, such asââBy faith ye are saved;â âhe that
                        believeth shall be saved;â âyou are complete in Him,â etc. This latter
                        phrase has come to express, in numbers of instances, the most utter ruin to
                        which the human soul can be brought. âComplete in Christâ! complete without
                        any true repentance, without any offering of the heart, without the
                        slightest change inward or outward, âcomplete in Him,â while living without
                        Him, and having to conscious connection with Him whatever; complete without
                        losing one evil feature of the godless life, without receiving one grace of
                        any kind, without doing or suffering anything, except perhaps a whispered âI
                        believe;â complete all in a minute, since somebody pointed to a text with
                        which perhaps the poor victim had been familiar all his life. Complete in
                        Christ with a gnawing consciousness at the heart that it is as sinful, as
                        empty, as powerless, and as joyless as ever; complete as a poor corpse would
                        be complete, if painted and dressed in the clothes of a living man! May God
                        save you from any such mock salvation as this.</p>
                    <p>Further, any theory that leads men to trust in <emph>general confessions and
                            prayers</emph> for salvation, is a mockery.</p>
                    <pb n="41" xml:id="VAB7129-041"></pb>
                    <p>How many thousands of people every Sunday confess to being âmiserable
                        sinners,â and cry to God to have mercy upon them, without the slightest
                        appreciation of the meaning of the words they utter. They feel better and
                        safer because of these confessions and prayers, whereas their prayers remove
                        them further, rather than bring them nearer, to any real salvation. What is
                        the use of prayer that produces no effect, that brings no answer? Here is a
                        mother whose boy is condemned to die: the father goes to the Queen to beg
                        for his life. When he returns, the mother says, âWell, have you succeeded?â
                        He answers, âI have put up my petition before the Queen.â âWell, but what is
                        the answer?â âOh, you must not expect a direct answer: I have no answer, not
                        have I any reason to believe that I shall get one, but I have put up my
                        petition.â The mother would say, âThat is a delusion; I want to know whether
                        my boy is going to be released; I cannot sleep in my bed till I know what
                        the answer is!â Now, I say, people who go on petitioning God for years
                        together, never concerning themselves about the answer, or even expecting
                        one, show that they are utterly insincere, and consequently obnoxious to
                        God, and yet there are thousands of such people, who go to and fro to our
                        churches and chapels every Sunday like a door on its hinges. They say, âO
                        Lord, have mercy upon us, miserable sinners,â but they have no real desire
                        for His mercy, no recognition even of the necessity for the forgiveness of
                        sins, no concern about living to please Him, no idea of what repentance or
                        salvation really means! Is it not manifest that such hypocritical
                        confessions and prayers render those who engage in them more impervious to
                        the truth, and<pb n="42" xml:id="VAB7129-042"></pb> more oblivious to any true
                        idea of salvation, than they would be without them? God says such prayers
                        are an abomination to Him. There is only one kind of prayer from an
                        unconverted soul which is acceptable to God, and that is the prayer that is
                        wrung out of the heart by anguish for sin.</p>
                    <p>Further, another mock salvation is presented in the shape of <emph>ceremonies
                            and sacraments</emph>. These were only intended as outward signs of an
                        inward spiritual reality, whereas men are taught that by going through them
                        or partaking of them, they are to be saved. Amongst these may be classes
                        Baptism, the last Supper, and the ceremonials of ancient or modern
                        Churches.</p>
                    <p>Oh, the thousands of souls who are resting their hopes of salvation on the
                        fact that they have been baptized, not only such as believe in the palpable
                        delusion of baptismal regeneration, but amongst ordinary church and chapel
                        going people. As I look at our Army congregations in Rinks, Theatres, and
                        other similar places, and note the signs of sin, debauchery, and crime on
                        many of their faces, I say to myself, I suppose all these people have been
                        baptized; but I do not think there are many thieves, or harlots, or
                        drunkards, or openly immoral people who claim baptismal regeneration. Thank
                        God! It is only genteel sinners who can bring themselves to believe in such
                        a palpable sham, and yet, if baptism possesses any efficacy, it should be as
                        effective in the one class of sinners as in the other.</p>
                    <p>What an inveterate tendency there is in the human heart to trust in outward
                        forms, instead of seeking the inward grace! And where this is the case,
                            what<pb n="43" xml:id="VAB7129-043"></pb> a hinderance, rather than help,
                        have these forms proved to the growth, nay, to the very existence, of that
                        spiritual life which constitutes the real and only force of Christian
                        experience!</p>
                    <p>It is a calamity deeply to be deplored that men should thus put the form in
                        the place of the power, but they have always been doing so. It is only
                        another species of that idolatry which has prevailed from the foundation of
                        the world. Take, for instance, the brazen serpent. All are familiar with the
                        story of that miraculous intervention of Jehovah on behalf of the Israelites
                        dying from the poisonous bites of the fiery flying serpents, sent as a
                        punishment for their rebellious murmuring. God directed Moses to exhibit a
                        brazen serpent on a pole, and to proclaim to the bitten multitudes that all
                        who would look to it should be healed. Thousands looked, and as they looked
                        were cured. In memory of that wonderful deliverance, and doubtless also as
                        an emblem of the coming Saviour, that serpent was preserved; but when, in
                        the years that followed, the people who came to attach undue value to the
                        ceremony of viewing it,âburning incense before it, with idolatrous
                        worship,âHezekiah, jealous for the honour of Him whom this form was only
                        intended to shadow forth, called it âNehustan,â <choice>
                            <abbr>i.e.</abbr>
                            <expan>id est</expan>
                        </choice>, a piece of brass, which it really was, breaking it in pieces and
                        casting it away with the trees of the groves and the altars of the high
                        places which the people had desecrated by idolatry. Now, we have nothing to
                        say against forms; but they are only, as it were, the bodies in which
                        spiritual ideas and purposes are manifested, and without <emph rend="sc">LIFE</emph> they are useless, and worse than useless.</p>
                    <p>When forms are exalted, and idolized, and trusted<pb n="44" xml:id="VAB7129-044"></pb> in, no matter how beautiful in themselves, or how
                        Divine in their origin, they become âNehustan,â as a piece of brass, or a
                        piece of bread, or a bowl of water. As the apostle said of circumcision,
                        when the Jews had put it in the place of righteousness, âNeither is that
                        circumcision which is outward in the flesh. Circumcision is that of the
                        heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but
                        of God.â And although originally ordained by God, he says again:
                        âCircumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of
                        the commandments of God.â</p>
                    <p>We feel persuaded that if Paul were here now, and could see the deadly
                        consequences which have arisen from the idolatrous regard given to what are
                        called the Sacraments of the Supper and of Baptism, he would say precisely
                        the same with respect to them; for even if Jesus Christ intended them to be
                        permanent institutions (against which there are very strong arguments, as
                        put forth by many most devoted and intelligent Christians ever since the
                        days of the apostles, amongst whom are the âFriendsâ of our own time), such
                        is the awful abuse to which these ceremonies have been subjected, that we
                        feel sure Paul would say Baptism is nothing, and the ceremony of the Lordâs
                        Supper is nothing, apart from keeping the commandments of God, especially
                        that great and allâcomprehensive commandment, âThou shalt love the Lord thy
                        God with all thy heart, and mind, and soul, and strength, and thy neighbour
                        as thyself.â</p>
                    <p>Christians often say to me, when I put this view before them, âAh, but you
                        have no authority to remit the Supper, because the Lord said we were to
                            take<pb n="45" xml:id="VAB7129-045"></pb> it in remembrance of Him till He
                        come!â I answer that He left the taking of it at all perfectly discretional;
                        and as to its continuance, that entirely depends on which coming He alluded
                        to. âFriends,â and many others of the most spiritual and deeply taught
                        Christians of all times, have believed that He then referred, as in so many
                        other places which are generally misunderstood, to His coming at the end of
                        the Jewish dispensation. Any way, our Lord, who had long before said to the
                        woman of Samaria, âThe hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain
                        nor yet at Jerusalem (in any special sense) worship the Father.... But the
                        hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father
                        in spirit and in truth,â anywhere and everywhere, could not have intended to
                        teach that God could be more acceptably or profitably worshipped through any
                        particular form or ceremony than without such form or ceremony, and
                        especially if there were weighty reasons on the other side for rejecting
                        it!! Neither is it credible to a spiritually enlightened mind that He who
                        said, âIf a man love Me, he will keep My words, and My Father will love him,
                        and we (I and My Father) will come unto him, and make our <emph>abode</emph>
                        with him,â could have intended to teach that through the earthly medium of
                        bread and wine His people were to <emph>remember</emph> Him on whom their
                        thoughts were to be constantly concentrated, or to commune with Him in any
                        special sense above that in which they were to commune with Him always and
                        everywhere. The water which Jesus gives, and to which alone He attaches any
                        importance, is that which is âin us a well of water springing up into
                        everlasting lifeâ;<pb n="46" xml:id="VAB7129-046"></pb> and the wine which He
                        values and promises to drink with us in His Fatherâs kingdom, is that wine
                        of the kingdom which is righteousness, and <emph>peace, and joy</emph> in
                        the Holy Ghost.</p>
                    <p>Friends, do you partake of <emph>these</emph> sacraments? If not, rivers of
                        earthly water, vineyards of wine, will avail you nothing; they will be as
                        âNehustan.â</p>
                    <p>If we were to have any binding forms in the new and spiritual kingdom in
                        which all forms were to find fulfilment, it seems to me that there is a
                        great deal more ground for insisting on washing of one anotherâs feet than
                        for either of those already referred to; and in this we can see a great
                        practical lesson on the human side which our Lord actually laid down. How
                        comes it, I wonder, that many of those who regard the former with such
                        sanctimonious reverence, can utterly, and without scruple, set aside the
                        latter? I fear that human pride and priestly assumption must be held largely
                        responsible.</p>
                    <p>Further, nothing is more evident to all who have any acquaintance with the
                        history of Christianity, than that the undue value set upon these ceremonies
                        has been one of the greatest hindrances to the extension of Christianity.
                        Again and again have its valiant warriors paused in their triumphal
                        progress, and turned aside from the battle with the great forces of evil, to
                        quarrel amongst themselves concerning these mere externals.</p>
                    <p>When I was in Ireland, some of the oldest and most experienced Christians who
                        took part in that great revival some twentyâfive years ago told me that a
                        great proportion of the results of that wonderful work of God were lost, in
                        consequences of a controversy about<pb n="47" xml:id="VAB7129-047"></pb> water
                        baptism. Do you wonder that we of the Salvation Army shrink from the
                        possibility of such a sacrifice of the greater to the lessâespecially when
                        we are backed up by the great apostle of us Gentiles thanking God that he
                        baptized none of this early converts, and for the very same reason, namely,
                        because they were making the ceremony a cause of controversy!</p>
                    <p>Further, what can be the value of imitating the marchings and vestments and
                        songs of the ancient Jewish Church? We are not accepted in the beloved Jews,
                        and if these ceremonies had become, as God said they were, a stink in His
                        nostrils because of the backsliding unbelief and hardness of heart of His
                        ancient people, how much greater must the offence of them be when adopted by
                        impenitent, infidel, and rebellious Gentiles. Neither can it be any less
                        repugnant to the mind of God, that spiritually uncircumcised Philistines
                        should dare to put their hands to His ark, by anticipating the signs,
                        ordinances, and alleluias of the Church triumphant. What have such people to
                        do with the songs of martyrs and confessors, or with the alleluias of the
                        angel bands who stand before the Lord in His temple? âRebellion is as the
                        sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry.â And yet
                        what multitudes who are hardening their hearts and stiffening their necks
                        every day against the claims of God and of His truth, dare to bow down to
                        what they call the table of the Lord and unite in what they believe to be
                        the songs of saints and angels. The first qualification for participating in
                        any spiritual exercises or ceremonies, is the <emph>renewal of the
                            heart</emph> by the Holy Ghost. If you could have the very same
                        ceremonial which they have in heaven, with angels<pb n="48" xml:id="VAB7129-048"></pb> as your ministers, unless you had the spirit of
                        it within, it would profit you nothing. âThough I speak with the tongues of
                        men and of angels, and have not the love of God, I am nothing.â And our Lord
                        said, with respect to some of His hearers, âThen shall ye begin to say, We
                        have eaten and drunk in Thy presence, and Thou hast taught in our streets.
                        But He shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from Me,
                        all ye workers of iniquityâ; showing that even where Christ Himself was the
                        preacher, if the heart remained under the bondage of sin and in the gall of
                        bitterness, the hearers would only inherit greater condemnation, and sink
                        into a deeper hell.</p>
                    <p>I must not omit to say a word here on the salvation of unbelief,
                        notwithstanding that I purpose to enlarge on it at a future time. The most
                        astounding theory of all the false theories about salvation, and also the
                        latest novelty propagated, alas, from Christian pulpits and through the
                        Christian press, as well from avowedly infidel platforms, is that man is to
                        be ultimately saved from his errors and iniquities, and especially from all
                        trouble concerning them, by a simple negation. He is to dismiss from his
                        mind all the creeds, all idea of any precise revelation, and to get light
                        from any natural earthly source he can, especially from the modern lights,
                        who are responsible for this new theory. He is to throw his mind back as far
                        as is possible towards heathenism, nay, further back than those enlightened
                        heathen philosophers to whom I referred in my first lecture, for he must on
                        no account even sigh after anything supernatural or Divine. He is to believe
                        in himself and in humanity; especially the future of humanityâseeing that
                        there are so many<pb n="49" xml:id="VAB7129-049"></pb> ugly facts about its
                        present. Thus he will have no more difficulties, sighings, or cryings!</p>
                    <p>He is to put away everything unpleasant and unsightly as far as he can, even
                        if it professes to be the word of God, and possessing his soul (no, I beg
                        your pardon, his mind) in patience, to wait and hope till the law of
                        evolution has transformed our poor sinâstricken and groaning earth into a
                        heathen paradise!</p>
                    <p>What a striking reproduction is this modern revelation, only in a new
                        fashion, of the words of fools thousands of years ago, who used to say, âHow
                        doth God know? and is there knowledge in the Most High?â and who âconsider
                        not that they do evil.â</p>
                    <p>Truly we may say of all these theories, ceremonies, prayers, faiths, and
                        unbeliefs, which are palmed on man as substitutes for salvation from sin,
                        Vanity of vanities, cruel mockeries, making destruction doubly sure.</p>
                    <p>Poor humanity still cries out, âWho will show us any good?â Miserable
                        comforters are ye all, leaving us still on the dunghill, covered with
                        wounds, bruises, and putrefying sores. <emph rend="sc">WHAT SHALL WE DO TO
                            BE SAVED?</emph></p>
                </div>
                <div type="section">
                    <head>Deliverance from Sin.</head>
                    <p>Let us now consider the character of that salvation proposed by God for our
                        race. The salvation of God embraces deliverance, restoration, preservation,
                        and glorification.</p>
                    <p>Of course the mere idea of salvation supposes some enemy, bondage, disease,
                        or danger; there can be no salvation where there is nothing to be saved
                        from. All the saviours raised by God for Israel during their<pb n="50" xml:id="VAB7129-050"></pb> national existence were actual deliverers of
                        their people from their enemies, otherwise they could not have been saviors.
                        Moses, Joshua, Gideon, Nehemiah, and many others, were real deliverers of
                        their people; they delivered from the outward consequences of sin; but the
                        great distinguishing feature of our Joshua is that He delivers His people
                        from their spiritual enemies, and from the power of sin itself. Where there
                        is no deliverance there can be no salvation. What a mockery and a delusion
                        it is for a man to profess to be saved, while he is groaning under the power
                        of his spiritual enemies. If you are under the domination of sin, you are
                        yet an utter stranger to the salvation of God.</p>
                    <p>First: Salvation implies <emph>restoration</emph>.</p>
                    <p>Salvation to a man who is sick means restoration to health; to man who is
                        drowning, restoration to dry land; to am man dying, restoration to life; to
                        a man on the verge of bankruptcy it means liquidation of his debts, and
                        restoration to solvency.</p>
                    <p>The common sense of mankind has prevented any theoretical deliverances or
                        mock salvations for these temporal maladies and destructions, but our great
                        adversary, who lieth in wait to deceive, has succeeded, as we have already
                        seen, in deluding men and women, as to the reality of Salvation when applied
                        to the soul. But the salvation of God is no less real and practical for the
                        soul than any of these temporal salvations are for the body or the
                        circumstances.</p>
                    <p>What is manâs disease? Sin, badness, falseness, spiritual death. Salvation
                        means restoration to goodness, to truth, to spiritual life, and to God. It
                        means deliverance from inward evil, and renewal of the heart<pb n="51" xml:id="VAB7129-051"></pb> in righteousness and true holiness. It means the
                        right adjustment of the faculties of the soul, bringing it into harmony with
                        the laws of its own being, with the law of God, and with the rightful claims
                        of its fellow beings. In short, it means being <emph rend="sc">PUT
                            RIGHT</emph> in all its relations for time and for eternity.</p>
                    <p>Second: Salvation implies <emph>preservation</emph>.</p>
                    <p>In order to the wellâbeing and happiness of a being who has been saved from
                        any disaster or death, there must be a provision for his continuance in a
                        state of health or safety. It would be a small mercy to save a man from
                        drowning, if he were under the cruel necessity of throwing himself into the
                        water again toâmorrow; and equally small would be the mercy pardoning a
                        sinner, and restoring him to a sense of peace and purity, if no provision
                        had been made for his continuance in such a state of salvation. The
                        salvation of God contemplates all the weaknesses and necessities of fallen
                        human nature; hence the Christ of God becomes âthe author of eternal
                        salvation to all them that obey Him.â He not only restores, but He promises
                        to dwell <emph>in</emph> His people as the power of an endless life,
                        enabling them to purify their hearts by faith, to love God with all their
                        souls and strength, and to offer themselves as living sacrifices, holy and
                        acceptable in His sight. He promises to empower them to resist the devil, to
                        keep themselves unspotted from the world, and to fight manfully under the
                        banner of His cross till death.</p>
                    <p>Do you ask for living witnesses of such a salvation? Thank God, there are
                        thousands who can testify that they have passed from darkness to light, that
                        they have been delivered out of the hands of all their<pb n="52" xml:id="VAB7129-052"></pb> enemies, and are now enabled to serve God,
                        walking before Him in righteousness and holiness day by dayâthousands, not
                        of genteel, refined, religiously trained people, such as most of you here
                        toâday, but from amongst the most ignorant, neglected, besotted, and openly
                        wicked of earthâs populations. They stand forward, an exceeding great army
                        of witnesses to the reality of the salvation of God, and to the power of His
                        Christ to deliver, to restore, to purify, and to keep all those who really
                        receive and obey Him.</p>
                    <p>Third: The Salvation of God embraces also <emph>glorification</emph>.</p>
                    <p>How do we know? Well, first, reasoning from analogy, and seeing that the
                        great change wrought in true saints is in the <emph>soul</emph>, and that it
                        manifests itself in spiritual and heavenly instincts, dispositions, and
                        aspirations, which do not find their full development or satisfaction in
                        this life, we conclude that there is a future and more congenial sphere for
                        such development and satisfaction.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, we have the most satisfactory evidence which mortals can give, of
                        future glorification in the fact that many are glorified before our eyes in
                        death. Amidst the humiliation, pains, and agonies of physical dissolution,
                        we see the soul emerging from the wreck of its physical environment,
                        triumphing over him hath the power of death, and in regal majesty pluming
                        its wings for its final flight, and in view of such a victory, human reason,
                        no less than Divine revelation, declares: âDeath is swallowed up in
                        victory.â</p>
                    <p>Are there any here who want salvation? Come and try our Saviour Lord. He can
                        cure your disease, extract the poison out of your heart, and make you<pb n="53" xml:id="VAB7129-053"></pb>
                        <emph>new creatures</emph>! We testify that He has done this for some of us
                        on this platform; whereas we once were the children of wrath, because the
                        children of sin, even as others, now He has made us the children of God and
                        of light, enabling us to seek those things that are above.</p>
                    <p>Consistently with our profession, we consecrate ourselves, our whole being,
                        our children, influence, time, life, and, if need be, death, to the pressing
                        of this salvation on the attention and acceptance of our fellowâmen. We make
                        all things bow down before this unbending resolution, to seek and to save
                        the lost.</p>

                    <p><emph rend="sc">BENEVOLENCE</emph> has come somewhat into fashion of late. It
                        has become the correct things to do the slums, since the Prince of Wales did
                        them; and this general idea of caring in some way or degree for the poor and
                        wretched has extended itself even into the region of creeds, so that we have
                        now many schemes for the salvation of mankind without a real Saviour.</p>
                    <p>Do not misunderstand me. I have no objectionânay, I rejoice in any real good
                        being done for anybody, much more for the poor and sufferingâ I have no
                        objection that a large society of intelligent Christians should take up so
                        noble an object as that of caring for stray dogs, providing it does not
                        interfere with caring for stray babies! I desire not to find fault with what
                        is good, but to point out the evil which, to my mind, so largely diminishes
                        the satisfaction one would otherwise feel in much benevolent effort being
                        put forth around us. As I said at the beginning, the most precious stone
                        given instead of bread is useless to a starving man.</p>
                    <p>Surely nobody ever cared for poor suffering humanity so much as Jesus Christ.
                        He gladly put forth His mighty power for the healing and feeding of the
                        body, and He laid it down most distinctly that all who<pb n="58" xml:id="VAB7129-056"></pb> were true to Him must love the poor and give up
                        their all for them in the same practical way in which He did; but all this
                        real brotherhood did not prevent His keeping the great truths of
                            <emph>salvation ever to the front</emph>, and applying them as
                        relentlessly to the poor as to the rich, and <foreign xml:lang="lat" rend="i">vice versÃ¢</foreign>.</p>
                    <p>But now in the name of Christ we are asked to believe either that the truest
                        way to carry out His intentions is to ignore menâs souls and care only for
                        their bodies, or else to join with this sort of material salvation some
                        theory that will practically get rid of all serious soulâneed.</p>
                </div>
                <div type="section">
                    <head>The First Scheme</head>
                    <p>of salvation without a Christ provides for attention to all the needs of this
                        body, ignoring the soul.</p>
                    <p>This system has not only become more popular in many Christian circles than
                        any of Christâs teachings, but some of its advocates actually go so far as
                        to place it in favourable contrast with any spiritual work whatsoever, thus
                        plainly intimating that hose who really have the spirit of Christ show it
                        better by devotion to these soâcalled practical ends than by what are
                        assumed to be the less practical efforts which have regard to the world to
                        come. This religion of bodily compassion may almost be said to have many
                        sects devoted to it, each having their own favourite theory.</p>
                    <p>First, we have the <emph>educationalists</emph>.</p>
                    <p>These almost abandon the existing generation, but are confident of the
                        results of their labours upon the coming one, such results being
                        conveniently remote. But whether in connection with weekâday or Sunday
                        schools, this plan has had at least the trial of one generation, with
                        extremely bad results so far as we<pb n="59" xml:id="VAB7129-057"></pb> can
                        judge. What a mockery of mankind to suppose or to teach that mere
                        information can satisfy its wants, when the more information men get, the
                        more clearly we see the reign of evil in the world, and the hopelessness of
                        attaining to righteousness, so far human power is concerned. Yet, strange to
                        say, the efforts of an enormous proportion of the mission agencies at work
                        are directly devoted to education, and the ablest heathen in the world
                        toâday are those who have been carefully instructed in missionary
                        institutions, and have used their education to obtain higher positions and
                        greater influence in the world, with which they now the better withstand the
                        gospel of Christ.</p>
                    <p>Many of the more sensible Christians, perceiving how little ordinary
                        education can do for the toiling masses, devote their attention to
                        mechanical education, hoping to raise the position and prospects of the
                        working classes by teaching them how to put a better finish on their daily
                        tasks, although it is notorious that the cleverest of workmen are frequently
                        the greatest drunkards and the most miserable of men.</p>
                    <p>Second on this list, for the regeneration of society, we have the
                            <emph>houseâbuilders</emph>.</p>
                    <p>These are afflicted, and rightly so, with the overcrowded condition of the
                        workingâclass dwellings, and consider that all will be well when the people
                        are better housed, shutting their eyes to the condition of multitudes who
                        may be seen toâday living in the greatest sin and misery in wellâbuilt
                        modern dwellings. Certainly it is a shameful scandal on those Christian
                        landlords who keep their tenants in buildings unfit for dogs; but, after
                        all, not so much more shameful than the conduct of those who, although
                        aroused to the<pb n="60" xml:id="VAB7129-058"></pb> frightful condition of the
                        masses, deliberately attempt their improvement on the same principles as if
                        they were cattle, mainly by means of buildings which pay a liberal interest.
                        No one could possibly be more thankful than I should to see the compassion
                        which has of late found such loud expression in words, embodied in some
                        practical scheme for the provision of comfortable, wholesome houses for the
                        poor, at such rental as they could comfortably pay; but to provide this,
                        with land under our present iniquitous system, will require a benevolence
                        willing to âlend, hoping for nothing again.â</p>
                    <p>Thirdly: Next comes the <emph>total abstinence plan</emph> for the salvation
                        of the people.</p>
                    <p>Amongst those who devote themselves to this sphere of labour there are some
                        of whom I would speak with the greatest respect, namely, those who perceive
                        that in all these outward things there is no remedy without some radical
                        internal change. The majority, however, observing that drink has more than
                        anything else contributed to the degradation of the people, concentrate
                        their efforts upon their deliverance from this one evilâunquestionably a
                        great temporal goodâbut we have only to look across the Channel to see
                        abundant evidence that the people may be almost clear of drunkenness without
                        being, for that reason, and <emph>nearer to God</emph> or true happiness. To
                        soberise without <emph>saving</emph> can only be compared to the action of a
                        set of people who should with heroic effort drag drowning men ashore, and
                        then leave them lying all unconscious within reach of the waves.</p>
                    <p>Fourthly: Another scheme of temporal salvation may be represented as
                            <emph>rescuing work</emph>.</p>
                    <pb n="61" xml:id="VAB7129-059"></pb>
                    <p>There are benevolent efforts of many kinds put forth for the rescue of
                        various classes of fallen or endangered people from their several perils,
                        without a thought of placing them in spiritual safety. I am not speaking
                        with the least desire to depreciate any of these efforts; but what I would
                        point out is, that while Christ held up for condemnation the priest who
                        haughtily passed by the poor victim, He no less held up to condemnation the
                        Levite who deliberately looked at his necessities and yet passed on. I
                        desire to give every credit for true kindly feeling on behalf of the fallen
                        or suffering; but it seems to me unaccountable that intelligent beings
                        should look upon any form of human ruin without realizing that something
                        must be done <emph>within</emph>, as well as without, in order to produce
                        any lasting change for the better.</p>
                    <p>Fifthly: Another plan of temporal salvation is the <emph>providing for needy
                            children</emph>.</p>
                    <p>This is one of the most favourite hobbies of benevolent people, and properly
                        so, if it were only carried out in the right way. But how astounding, that
                        people professing to revere and follow <emph>Christ</emph> should be capable
                        of entertaining any schemes which undertake the guardianship of children,
                        and yet which ignores their spiritual necessities, which trains and teaches
                        them how to get on in the world <emph>without God</emph>. Alas! I know from
                        personal experience and actual contact with some of the children turned out
                        of orphan asylums of high reputation in Christian circles, that, so far as
                        any real living acquaintances with the things of God, or any practical
                        carrying out of the teachings of Jesus Christ, are concerned, they might as
                        well have been brought up amongst infidels; and I am by<pb n="62" xml:id="VAB7129-060"></pb> no means alone in this opinion. I have reason to
                        believe, that in many such instances, nothing would be more highly resented
                        than any attempt to make such children realize the willingness and
                        sufficiency of a personal living Saviour to renew their hearts and to enable
                        them to walk in obedience to His will, and to keep themselves âunspotted
                        from the world.â Dry conventional dogmas and ceremonies constitute the only
                        notion that thousands of such children have of the religion of Jesus Christ;
                        and no wonder, considering the specimens they have had exhibited to them in
                        the conduct of many of those whom their poor little lives and hearts have
                        been committed. I have many times said what I here deliberately repeat, that
                        if I were dying and leaving a family of helpless children, I would leave it
                        as my last request that they might be dividedâone here, and another
                        thereâamongst any poor, but really godly, families who would receive them,
                        rather than they should be got into the most highly trumpetted orphanage
                        with which I am acquainted; for I should infinitely prefer that their bodies
                        should lack necessary food and attention, rather than that their poor little
                        hearts and souls should be crushed and famished for want of love, both human
                        and Divine. Children brought up without love are like plants brought up
                        without the sun. I would suggest to some of you ladies who may be on
                        committees, or who might possibly get on to them, that you would be doing
                        God and humanity good service by visiting these institutions, not on
                        specified days, but at unthoughtâof hours or seasons; for instance, get up a
                        little earlier and go and insist on joining the children at their breakfast
                        table. On other occasions,<pb n="63" xml:id="VAB7129-061"></pb> demand admission
                        to the schoolroom, and observe the countenance and manner of those paid to
                        instruct these children; in short, observe the deportment of the paid
                        servants of the institution all the way through. A still better way,
                        byâtheâbye, of following your Saviour and serving your generation, would be
                        to take some such children yourselves and bring them up with all the love
                        and care with which you bring up your own, or would have done so had God
                        granted you the privilege. It will be a happy day for England when Christian
                        ladies transfer their sympathies from poodles and terriers to destitute and
                        starving children!</p>
                    <p>Sixth. Another scheme, perhaps the lowest of these material systems of
                        salvation, is the <emph>feeding system</emph>.</p>
                    <p>I mean that system in which large sums of money are spent, merely upon
                        providing some special feast for those who are well known to be, as a rule,
                        almost without food. Now, I think you will all believe me when I say that I
                        rejoice in every bite or sup provided for the needy, but I cannot help
                        seeing how monstrously all this exhibits the recklessness of the Christian
                        world as to the greater needs of the perishing. Some of the most intelligent
                        and highly placed people in the country may be seen looking complacently on
                        upon the ragged, hungry crowd, who are eagerly devouring the only good meal
                        perhaps which they have had for a twelvemonth, or which is likely to be
                        within their reach for as long again, looking on without apparently having
                        their sense of satisfaction in the slightest degree ruffled by the thought
                        (if such people ever do think) about the lives which these âpoor creaturesâ
                        live during the other 364 days of the year! Such observers do not seem to
                        look behind the staring<pb n="64" xml:id="VAB7129-062"></pb> eyes and hollow
                        cheeks and savage ferocity of the eaters. The starving hunger, the devilish
                        dispositions and abject despair of the â<emph>man inside</emph>â does not
                        seem to trouble them.</p>
                    <p>Now, what I want to impress upon you is, not that these bodily wants are
                        unworthy of the attention bestowed upon them,âfor I regard it as a crying
                        shame that such wants should not have a thousand times more attention, and
                        in a thousand times more comprehensive fashion than they at present
                        receive,âbut what I complain of is, the attempt to substitute any or all of
                        these for a thorough work in the heart; and when such âcharityâ is carried
                        out on the long pole system, and yet paraded in the name of Christ, I regard
                        it as rather an insult than a credit to His name. It seems to me that the
                        Popular Christianity which would put these things in the place of the gospel
                        is only another of the clever shams of the devil by which to ruin our race,
                        and to turn aside Godâs people to broken cisterns, only insuring a more
                        eternal weight of misery at the cost of a little present relief.</p>
                    <p>Oh, friends, you who have health, talent, and means, make up your own minds
                        on which side you will act. Remember that in the light of that judgment
                        which is coming on, it will appear worse than useless to have expended your
                        energies and powers on doing that kind of good which will <emph rend="sc">NOT LAST</emph>, which will, in fact, by itself, serve the enemiesâ
                        purpose rather than otherwise. Either do as Christ commands you, or cease to
                        call your work by His name. Do not let any one delude you with the idea that
                        you are <emph>following Christ</emph>, or doing that work which is
                        peculiarly His, in contradistinction to all merely human benevolence and
                        earthly salvation,<pb n="65" xml:id="VAB7129-063"></pb> unless you are seeking
                            <emph>first</emph> His kingdom, both within your own soul and every one
                        elseâs.</p>

                <div type="section">
                    <head>The Second Scheme.</head>
                    <p>The second of these schemes of salvation without a Saviour is even worse than
                        that which I have already described; for while that tended to turn the
                        thoughts of men from the world to come to some good or advantage of a
                        temporal kind, this would lay a degrading hand upon eternity itself, and,
                        under pretense of elevating humanity, would push it into a future life with
                        its deepest intuitions all scorched up, and its highest aspirations
                        disappointed and blighted.</p>
                    <p>Here, again, are to be found various sects, etc.</p>
                    <p>First comes <emph>universalism</emph>. This theory would make men into mere
                        puppets, who for the time being are allowed to be the prey of an evil power,
                        but after a certain amount of suffering are to be picked up by a better
                        power. Like some unhappy country whose patriotic force has been crushed out
                        of it until it has become the helpless prize, first of one monarch and then
                        of another, so the kingdom of the human soul is to pass from evil to good
                        and from Satan to God.</p>
                    <p>The blackest wretch on earth, who has made his home a hell, and spread moral
                        ruin as widely as he could reach, is, according to this theory, to be saved
                        even as the purest saint; for âall menâ are to be savedâby repentance and a
                        holy life, if they choose, if not, still they are to be savedâby their own
                        free will, if they have fixed their affections on things above; but if, on
                        the other hand, they have loved sin and vice, and committed all the
                        catalogue of crimes, still salvation is to come out of devilry, and a clean
                        thing out of<pb n="66" xml:id="VAB7129-064"></pb> an unclean! To try to make men
                        believe in such a system seems to me to be no less insulting to their
                        understandings than it is shocking to their consciences, and defiant of the
                        plainest teachings of Scripture common sense and analogy.</p>
                    <p>The extent of our present knowledge with respect to a better world is that it
                        is the abode of those âwho have overcomeâ evil. Its songs are of victory!
                        Its inhabitants renounced the mark of the beast on earth, washed their robes
                        and made them white in the blood of the Lamb, kept the commandments of God,
                        and through much tribulation were faithful unto death. To this assemblage of
                        crowned victors, the universalist would introduce the man who, while on
                        earth, overcame not evil but good, who was victorious, not over his own
                        passions, the temptations of the devil, and the forces of evil around him,
                        but over the dictates of his own conscience, the influences and agencies
                        which God put in operation in order to save him, and over all the forces of
                        righteousness with which he came in contact. Strange mercy! to send a man
                        like this to a heaven where every song would remind him of defeat and
                        degradation, and every crown and psalm make conspicuous his false and
                        ignominious position. Strange justice also which gives the prize to him who
                        never won it, nay, who despised the conditions of the contest, and refused
                        to enter the lists!</p>
                    <p>Second in this scheme comes what I shall designate as the <emph>all love
                            theory</emph>.</p>
                    <p>The propounders of this theory, without daring actually to contest the great
                        facts of revelation, would have us be silent about the most serious of them,
                        lest we should shock the people. They tell us gravely that<pb n="67" xml:id="VAB7129-065"></pb> men will be ârepelled from the gospel,â if its
                        truths about judgment and hell are not kept in the background; tell, say
                        they, about the Fatherâs love, but do not talk about âdamnationâ and âthe
                        wrath to come.â Strange mercy this, to let men perish rather than tell them
                        that sin breeds a hell from which none can deliver them. What should we
                        think of a father too merciful to tell us the truth? Should we not say he
                        was cruel? The child playing on your hearthârug might well complain if you
                        will not tell him that fire burns, because, forsooth, he might think you
                        cruel to have it there, and so you leave him to find it out by falling in!
                        âHush, do not frighten the people;â sing to them, talk sweetly to them;
                        there are no modern words for hell and suchâlike horrors. In ancient days
                        there were prophets, whose fiery warnings of judgment to come led whole
                        nations to repentance, but men think they know better now. The God who sent
                        those poor old fanatics to speak plain words of wrath and denunciation is
                        not their God. His words of burning reproof and fearful threatening is not
                            <emph>their</emph> burden. Their message is some âsweet textâ tied to a
                        bunch of flowers; their burden can be given by âSaturday evenings for the
                        people,â where âcomic readings,â âgymnastics,â âsecular music by the choirâ
                        are the converting measures deemed most suitable. Alas! alas! such maudlin
                        souls are not worthy to deal with the things of eternity! Who wants in the
                        hospital a man too âtenderâ to probe the wound, too âmercifulâ to amputate
                        the mortifying limb, too âlovingâ to say with firmness, Do this, bear this,
                        or die? Away with such a sentimental surgeon, you would cry; send him to
                        pick rose leaves, where his feeble hands will do<pb n="68" xml:id="VAB7129-066"></pb> no mischief. And yet these overâmerciful friends
                        I am talking about would spiritually elevate the masses by twaddling to them
                        in their sins and rebellion, about love, sweetness, and peace, when, if they
                        did not shut their ears, and were willing to catch the sound, they would
                        hear the thundering echoes from every sinnerâs conscience, âThere is no
                        peace to the wicked;â âWrath to come, wrath to come!â</p>
                    <p>Third. Next in this catalogue of modern salvations comes the <emph>theory of
                            doubt</emph>.</p>
                    <p>These doubters, while manifestly very shaky as to their own theory, argue
                        that all is âtoo uncertain for us to speak positively as to eternity.â As we
                        have before noted, their scheme for elevating men is to teach
                        knowânothingness. They seen to think that doubt in itself is something very
                        ennobling, that it, in things spiritual, for in things temporal they have
                        faith enough, and also exact it from others. They claim explicit trust in
                        their business relations, perfect confidence in their domestic lives, but
                        appear to think that to doubt the <emph>great God</emph> and His revelation
                        will somehow prove a great blessing and benefit to mankind; âas to eternal
                        things it is not seemly to speak positively.â</p>
                    <p>In yonder back street, ah, even in the worst dens of vice, are found men who
                        have in the depths of their sinful hearts some hidden memory, which is the
                        link to holy things. Perhaps they have stood when boys by the dying bed of
                        some humble believing father, who declared in his last hours that<emph>he
                            knew</emph> in whom he had believed; or perhaps, even in the later and
                        blacker days of their lives, they have seen a little one go from their own
                        dark homes with a heavenly smile upon its face, and the words, âJesus has
                        come to fetch me,â<pb n="69" xml:id="VAB7129-067"></pb> on its lips; and these
                        men believe without a doubt in the God who, somehow, made their fathers and
                        their children know Him, and some day they mean to turn to Him; but the
                        chains of an evil life are holding them down with the âmassesâ of desperate
                        and dangerous sinners around them. To these the modern scheme comes with its
                        new light, and lays its withering touch on these memories of good. âWe
                        cannot know,â it says; âwomen may have dreamt, and children believed, old
                        men may have had their sick fancies, but it is better to be without that
                        which is delusive; the only thing is that all is uncertain, the manly thing
                        is to doubt.â</p>
                    <p>Ah! rich man, you may sit in your palaceâlike home, where nothing unpleasant
                        is now allowed to enter, and it may seem little loss to you, so far, that
                        our belief in eternal things has been loosened; but to the poor man in his
                        bare life, and to the man who is bound by some sinful chain of vice, and
                        whose earthly career has not another gleam of hope, it becomes the final
                        stroke of misery and degradation to make him think that he cannot know with
                        any certainty any better things than those which now surround him. If there
                        is not anywhere in the universe a Saviourâs hand, whose clasp he may yet
                        feel, and on whose strength he may depend to draw him up out of his drunken
                        jailâbird existence to something purer and better, some day, when he shall
                        have made up his mind to be saved, then his one door of hope is closed, and
                        he realizes, with a bitterness which will drown itself in fresh outbursts of
                        sin and villainy, that there <emph>is no</emph> true light or guide anywhere
                        for anybody. Granted that the one guide is untrustworthy, the one
                        beaconâlight possibly false, he is out<pb n="70" xml:id="VAB7129-068"></pb> on
                        the sea of life without a spark of hope or cheer. Shipwreck and eternal ruin
                        may be the next event at any hour.</p>
                    <p>Fourth. â<emph>The Christian freeâthinkers</emph>â next claim our
                        attention.</p>
                    <p>These are bolder than the latter class, denying whatever seems to them to be
                        objectionable in the Scriptures. The inspiration of the Bible is to them on
                        a level with that of Shakespeare or Homer, and for anything they do not like
                        they have a free rendering, or a cool excision. They would take away what
                        they fancy to be stumblingâblocks in the path of men, without stopping to
                        consider whether God Himself placed them there as guidingâposts. Ah, what
                        contempt such men would feel for the word âfree,â if it were applied in
                        other ways. Who would tolerate the âfreeâ soldier, who set up his own
                        notions as to military matters, and at the critical hour of the fight was
                        found obeying and leading others to obey orders which had been altered by
                        the omission of all which he considered objectionable! Who would for long be
                        retained in her Majestyâs household who should presume to alter the rules of
                        court behaviour, and to expunge what he deemed irksome? And yet the
                        revelation which is to train servants for the eternal household of the King
                        of kings, and the laws laid down by the Lord of hosts, by which His battles
                        are to be fought, may be treated with a free hand, and tinkered and
                        pairedâobeyed or disobeyedâaccording to the notions of men who love their
                        own will better than anything else in heaven or on earth! Alas, I fear it
                        may be said of these doubters that âwhile they promise men liberty, they
                        themselves are servants to corruption,â and I would remind them<pb n="71" xml:id="VAB7129-069"></pb> âhow that the Lord, having saved the people out
                        of the land of Egypt, afterwards destroyed them that <emph>believed
                            not</emph>.â</p>
                    <p>We might go on to multiply these modern schemes for the improvement and
                        elevation of man, for they are legion, and some of them doubtless propounded
                        by those who have much real concern and compassion for the multitudes, but
                        which all the more, because there is so much of good in them, are the most
                        dangerous and ruinous to the highest interests of mankind.</p>
                    <p>Take away from the wayâfaring man the absolute certainty which he feels about
                        the truth of the gospel, and where do you leave him? Wretched and hopeless
                        in the very centre of his being. You may have fed his body, you may have
                        clothed and housed him, you may have educated his children, you may have
                        nursed him in sickness and comforted him in sorrow; but for all this he is
                        left on the moors to wander and die in desolation and darkness, in spite of
                        all your feeding and all your loving rushâlights.</p>
                    <p>This sort of compassion is the most cruel <foreign xml:lang="lat" rend="i">ignis fatuus</foreign> the devil ever invented. Depend upon it, you
                        cannot be more merciful than Jesus, who says toâday to you and to all men,
                        âHe that believeth shall be saved, and he that believeth not shall be
                        damned.â</p>

                    <p>We propose now to consider in juxtaposition with all these modern schemes for
                        the elevation of mankind, on which we have been remarking, <emph>that</emph>
                        one which is universally admitted to be the model scheme; the ideal of all
                        that is lovely, tender, ennobling, and comprehensive.</p>
                    <pb n="72" xml:id="VAB7129-070"></pb>
                    <p><emph>The scheme</emph> of Christ, with its aims and modes, as shown in the
                        story of His lifeâcompassion for the world. I contend that the compassion of
                        Jesus stands out distinguished as of another kind from all the philanthropic
                        plans which we have been considering.</p>
                    <p>First: By its <emph>clear perception of the worst feature of manâs
                            condition</emph>.</p>
                    <p>No doubt the Saviourâs heart ached in sympathy with the mass of human sorrow,
                        sickness, and poverty brought before Him. Where we have only a glimpse of
                        menâs trouble as we move hurriedly up and down among them, He has the whole
                        sad story unfolded to Him, and His keen love responded tenderly to every cry
                        for help. Nevertheless, He was never diverted from the <emph>great central
                            danger</emph>. To Him the sorrowful troubled crowd were not merely poor
                        and suffering, not merely oppressed by unjust laws, and crowded into badly
                        constructed dwellings,ânot merely hungry, hardâworked, and comfortless;
                        these were incidents which He sometimes alleviated and more often shared,
                        but the crowning peril, the absolutely certain woe which eclipsed, in His
                        sight, every other, was the <emph>loss of the soul</emph>. He flings aside
                        contemptuously the thought that living well in this world was a real
                        benefit. The fool of all the world, the man who in His opinion stood most
                        awful risk, is drawn by Him in a parable sketch which is little dwelt on in
                        these days. This fool in Christâs picture was the rich man with bursting
                        barns and âso much goodsâ that he knew not how to dispose of them. He was a
                        man who had been elevated by education enough, at any rate, to enable him to
                        do a good business; he enjoyed the benefits of a good dwelling, good food,
                        and, doubtless, the best society<pb n="73" xml:id="VAB7129-071"></pb> within his
                        reach; and yet he was a fool, and Christ holds him up as the last sample of
                        such, simply because he left his soul in jeopardy.</p>
                    <p>Again, Christ draws another picture, blacker and more awful yet, and again He
                        selects the rich man (the very man, remember, who had enjoyed the best of
                        this worlds benefits and who also was kind to the poor Lazarus), and yet
                        Christ draws aside the veil of the future world, and shows where earthly
                        elevation landed him.</p>
                    <p>âThe rich man died, and was buried; and in hell he lift up his eyes, being in
                        torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. And he cried
                        and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may
                        dip the tip of this finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented
                        in this flame. But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime
                        receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is
                        comforted, and thou art tormented. And beside all this, between us and you
                        there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from thence to
                        you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence.â</p>
                    <p>What! could it be Christ who talked about a man in fire, a man crying for a
                        drop of water, and denied even this small boon! Could it be Christ who
                        talked about torment, and showed this vision of despair; the tender, loving,
                        merciful Christ! Ah, He showed it, because <emph rend="sc">HE SAW IT;</emph>
                        because this was the real danger, from which He had come to deliver! Because
                        He knew that the sick beggar, covered with undressed wounds, and with scarce
                        an alleviating circumstance to assuage his sufferings, might have the
                            eternal<pb n="74" xml:id="VAB7129-072"></pb> compensation which should make
                        his earthly troubles seem like a dream, if only his soul was right, if only
                        he was ârich towards God.â Christ showed this, because it was the one thing
                        which no one else saw. The human needs of men were apparent enough to many
                        benevolent people in His day, including the rich giver who was going to
                        hell, but the crying soul needs, which had brought him out of heaven, the
                        hopeless woe to which even the rich and happy were driftingâthe undying
                        worm, the quenchless fire, were the visions of sorrow which He only saw, and
                        which His tenderest compassion betrayed itself in seeking to relieve. âFor
                        what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world and lose his
                        own soul?â may be taken as indicating the foundation principle of His entire
                        scheme of redemption.</p>
                    <p>Second: Christâs compassion is distinguished from all other compassions by
                        its <emph>plain, cutting, personal dealing</emph>.</p>
                    <p>âHe would eat with sinners,â talk familiarly and tenderly with the worst on
                        earth, and lay His hands upon the most loathsome, but He was incapable of
                        dealing lightly with their sin.</p>
                    <p>Imagine Christ giving an entertainment, and spending the evening in frivolous
                        talk, in order that He might humour sinners and attract them to Himself!
                        Imagine Him allowing His little band of disciples to sing current songs and
                        read âamusing selectionsâ for a couple of hours at a time to keep people out
                        of worse company! No, He was too tenderly compassionate for souls, who He
                        knew might end their time on earth at any moment, thus to fool away His
                        chance. He<pb n="75" xml:id="VAB7129-073"></pb> never lost an opportunity of
                        talking straight to them about their sins, the interests of their souls, and
                        the claims of His Fatherâs law. The young ruler comes to Him, and he is so
                        lovable, so moral, so food, might he not have been allowed to join the
                        little band of disciples, and to have gained light gradually? âYet lackest
                        thou one thingâ was pronounced all the more clearly because âHe loved him.â
                        âSell that thou hast, and follow Meâ rang out all the more distinctly
                        because He could offer treasure for the <emph>soul</emph>.</p>
                    <p>The compassion of Jesus was not of the maudlin kind which leaves men their
                        âlittle indulgences,â and shrinks from being âtoo hardâ on them, where
                        hardness is the indispensable condition of salvation. âIf thy right hand
                        offend thee, cut it off; if they right eye offend thee, pluck it out,â He
                        mercilessly prescribes; better, He decides, be maimed and suffering here,
                        than be cast into âeternal fire.â</p>
                    <p>As to the religious ideas of His day, He walked straight across them with a
                        cutting âWoe unto you!â Woe! woe! was the one cry with which He met the
                        teachers and professors of His time, provoking their bitterest hate and
                        animosity. âMaking clean the outside platter, while within are dead menâs
                        bones,â was His short description of them and their doings. He upset the
                        nice little fashions which had sprung up around the temple worship with a
                        whip of cords. âPublicans and harlots shall enter the kingdom before you,â
                        He told the grand professors who listened to Him. He inflicted the faithful
                        wounds of a friend, in order that He might awaken them to their danger and
                        lead them to seek the only remedy.</p>
                    <pb n="76" xml:id="VAB7129-074"></pb>
                    <p>Third: Christâs compassion was in direct contrast with all mere human
                        benevolence in its â<emph>other worldliness</emph>.â</p>
                    <p>No one will dispute that He possessed the power to elevate the masses in a
                        temporal sense, by bestowing on them all those benefits at which modern
                        philanthropy aims. He could have fed them by a miracle every day, as easily
                        as on the two occasions when He multiplied the bread; and who could have
                        lectured on science, or history, or invention, so clearly, so perfectly, as
                        He to whom all knowledge must be an open book? He could have brought into
                        His services those twelve legions of angels, and taken an earthly kingdom,
                        from which He could have dispensed wealth and prosperity to all around; but
                        He indicated <emph>His</emph> scheme for elevating and saving the people
                        when He said âI am the Wayââto another sphere, another realm, not of earthly
                        good, but of heavenly. When He was asked for the posts of honour in His
                        kingdom, He made it clear that He was leading to another and higher world
                        through a âbaptismâ and with a âcupâ of suffering and poverty in this.</p>
                    <p>Fourth: Christâs compassion stands out in its <emph>spiritual
                            fellowship</emph>.</p>
                    <p>The King of kings makes eternal friends of the fishermen. âHe did not visit
                        the poor,â âHe did not elevate their sad lot,â and walk on His own high
                        path, having His fellowship, His joys, His sorrows apart from them; but He
                        shared His life with them in a holy comradeship. He did not live in the
                        style and companionship of the worldly Pharisee, and occasionally visit
                        Peter, James, and John, and hold meetings for the working classes; no, He
                            lived<pb n="77" xml:id="VAB7129-075"></pb> with them and became education,
                        elevation, salvation, and all to them by His blessed fellowship. âYe are my
                        friends,â said He, and âall things that I have heard of My Father, I have
                        made known unto you.â His heart had no reserves from these men. Johnâs head
                        could lean on His breast, and Mary could sit at His feet, with the
                        consciousness that they were taken into His confidence, and were indeed as
                        brethren.</p>
                    <p>That they could not always understand Him was their fault, not His; but their
                        slowness and dulness never wearied His compassion, not caused Him to seek
                        friends elsewhere. He called His three fishermen to Him when He was about to
                        put forth any wonderful exercise of power. He wanted Peter, James, and John,
                        when He was raising the dead, and took them to share His joy on the mount of
                        transfiguration. He craved for their presence in His last agony, and desired
                        no better provision for His mother, when He hung upon the cross, that the
                        home that one of them could afford.</p>
                    <p>Fifth: The compassion of Jesus is yet further distinguished by its
                            <emph>Divine faith, and hope, and action</emph>.</p>
                    <p>He had faith in the possibilities of these people, which possibilities would
                        not have been very apparent to any other eye. He believed in the
                        transforming power of the Spirit which He could send them. His hope was not
                        chilled by stupidity, or foolishness, or nonâcomprehension on the part of
                        disciples or outsiders. Mighty compassion must that have been that could
                        live thirty years on such terms with such men, and never falter or turn
                        back. Many a fine scheme of modern benevolence dies and goes out when the
                        people who are to be benefited get to be known! âSuch wretches,â<pb n="78" xml:id="VAB7129-076"></pb> âso ungrateful,â âso presuming,â âso hopeless.â
                        But Christ hoped all things, believed all things, until the Peter who was
                        afraid of a servant girl stood triumphant before the three thousand
                        converts. Christ kept His little band together, although He knew there was a
                        traitor amongst them,âthe traitor who would betray Him, and sell Him for
                        money into the hands of His enemies. Christ forbore and worked with John
                        until the man who wanted fire from heaven to burn up sinners became an
                        apostle of love. Christ made the Samaritan harlot woman into His ambassador
                        on the spot; Christ made sound men of the lepers, and sane divines of the
                        mad. He called the devils out of those whom they tormented, and then let
                        loose the whole strange flock of exâharlots, maniacs, and lepers, to tell
                        His praises and to gather others to His presence. Christ went up to Calvary
                        undismayed by His perfect knowledge of sinful, perverse, opposing men, to
                        die for the whole ungrateful race. Christ hoped and believed in His own
                        blackest hour for the dying blackguard at His side, and saved him as he hung
                        there. Talk about âeternal hope!â Is not this the eternal hope which saves
                        to the uttermost now and here?</p>
                    <p>Sixth: The compassion of Jesus is further distinguished by His ever
                            <emph>going straight to the one end</emph>.</p>
                    <p>The whole work of Christ was aimed at the salvation of menâs
                            <emph>souls</emph>. And this is not the less true because He also
                        benefited their bodies by healing their diseases and sympathising with their
                        sorrows.</p>
                    <p>This latter side of His work is much dwelt upon in these days, and yet it was
                        a merely incidental part. If He had come to remove earthly suffering,
                        poverty, oppression, and distress, He would, as I have pointed<pb n="79" xml:id="VAB7129-077"></pb> out, certainly have gone about it in a different
                        way. He would have aimed at riches and position and ease, in order that He
                        might have shared them with His own chosen ones. He would have sought to
                        build up an earthly kingdom, where men should neither hunger nor thirst, nor
                        be sick, nor die; and it would have been a far easier task than the founding
                        of that new invisible kingdom which we have already tried to describe, where
                        only the spiritual and eternal should be of much importance. In comparison,
                        how much easier to have drawn crowds if He had always given them their
                        dinner, than to hold followers who should enter into the mysterious
                        doctrine, âI am the Bread of life;â âye must be born again!â</p>
                    <p>But He did feed the multitudes, and He did heal the sick! Yes, but He gave up
                        the former when He found that they followed Him for that only, and His acts
                        of healing were flashes of the Divine power within Him, rather than the
                        âwork given Him to do.â âI came to call sinners to repentance,â âI am come
                        to set the daughterâinâlaw against her motherâinâlaw, and a manâs foes shall
                        be they of his own household.â âI came to bring fire on earth.â âI came not
                        to send peace, but a sword.â These sayings, and multitudes of others, were
                        descriptive of a <emph>spiritual</emph> mission, and yet He was most tender,
                        as we readily trace, to every suffering, needy creature who came in contact
                        with Him. His pity was boundless for the lame, the blind, and the deaf, and
                        His loving heart must have grieved over much in the sea of human misery
                        brought before Him, of which we never hear. The truest love must ever seek
                        the highest good of its object, sometimes even with forgetfulness of
                        important lesser advantages.<pb n="80" xml:id="VAB7129-078"></pb> He gave the
                        great rule by which <emph>His</emph> compassion for menâs necessities was
                        guided, when He said, âSeek first the kingdom of God, and His righteousness;
                        and all other things shall be added unto you.â</p>
                    <p>Seventh: The compassion of Jesus stands out in contrast with all other in
                            <emph>its devotion unto death</emph>.</p>
                    <p>He was too merciful to men to spare them the bitter truths of hell, or
                        conceal from them the punishments due to transgression; but on Himself He
                        had no compassion.</p>
                    <p>If the penalty was indeed so awful, He would share it. He too would bear the
                        curse, the shame, the agony of dying for sin, so far as could for the
                        sinless One be possible.</p>
                    <p>How brightly this compassion shines out against that of many who profess so
                        much for the suffering and the lost. Watch the people who talk the most
                        loudly of their tenderness, and will not say one word of the âouter
                        darknessâ and the hell fire of which He said so much. Where are their
                        Calvarys? Are they remarkable for cross bearing? Are they noted for
                        selfâdenial, or is it in word only, and not in deed, that they are more
                        compassionate than Jesus? They do not like to repeat to the poor His
                        terrible words of warning. May it not be because they are unwilling to
                            <emph>act</emph> toward the poor as He did?</p>
                    <p>No rough living, no fishermen friends, no hungry, weary days, no homeless
                        nights, no persecution and contemptâabove all, no scourge, no crown of
                        thorns, no march up to Golgotha, no nailing to the cross, no agony, no dying
                        for the salvation of men! There can be no other dying love than that which
                        causes the<pb n="81" xml:id="VAB7129-079"></pb> real dying. Do settle that in
                        your minds, for without a dying, a real, complete, and eternal separation
                        between your old self and the new self, which means to live and die for
                        others, you cannot be a true disciple of Jesus Christ, or an eternal
                        benefactor to your race. You may not come to any such terrible end as your
                        Master did, for as a rule in outward things the servant is above his Lord,
                        but in some way or another you are doubtless called to follow Him in a path
                        full of suffering and selfâdenial, in a road of shame in which you will find
                        yourself completely cut off, alas, from the rest of mankind; but without
                        this daily dying, this true following of Him, do not expect to be able to do
                        any lasting good to those who are perishing around you.</p>
                    <p>Let no benevolent projects, no magnificent phrases deceive you. The good done
                        to mankind by the poor fisherman who spoke the truth, the whole truth, and
                        nothing but the truth, has surpassed all the achievements of modern
                        philanthropy as far as the noonâday sun surpasses the rushlight.</p>
                    <p>If you want to elevate the masses, go and ask <emph rend="sc">HIM</emph> how
                        to do it, and if the answer comes, âTake up thy cross and follow Me,â <emph rend="sc">OBEY.</emph></p>

                    <p>The subject for this afternoon is The Cowardly Service of Popular
                        Christianity in contrast with the Real Warfare which Christ demands of His
                        People.</p>
                    <p>I should like to say before I commence, that I hope, nay, I believe, that
                        many of my audience will give me credit for speaking the truth in love; that
                        although some things I may have to say may sound cutting, and will be
                        cutting, as all truth when it comes in contact with error must beâit would
                        cease to be truth if it were notâyet that I do not speak these things
                        censoriously. If I know anything of my own heart and experience, I can say I
                        do not speak these things harshly, but painfully and reluctantly. But they
                        have been burnt into my soul during twentyâone years of public work, by
                        absolute personal contact with the evils of which I speak. I have forborne
                        long, hoping that some one more able would take up this sword, until I
                        sometimes fear that I have been guilty of withholding my sword from
                        bloodâGod knows not for my own sake, for since I came to the crucifixion of
                        myself I have not cared much what men might say of me; but I have forborne
                        sometimes under a mistaken notion of dealing gently with, and of hiding, the
                        sins of professed Christians for fear of<pb n="86" xml:id="VAB7129-083"></pb>
                        hurting the kingdom. But some three or four years ago the Lord took me to
                        task, more especially on this matter, and showed me that I had no more right
                        to palliate a wrong state of things in His professing people than in open
                        sinnersâthat we ought to examine <emph>ourselves</emph>, judge
                            <emph>ourselves</emph>, and reprove <emph>ourselves</emph> and each
                        other, so that we might redeem His name from the awful effects of our
                        inconsistency, and of our coming so far short of the standard which Christ
                        has set up for us. Therefore what I saw this afternoon, and in my following
                        lectures, please to bear in mind I only say because I <emph rend="sc">MUST</emph>, and because I could not die in peace if I had not said it.
                        That I shall be criticised and condemned I fully expect, and that in exact
                        proportion to the force with which the truths shall be demonstrated in every
                        manâs conscience. But be assured that this effort has cost me many a tear
                        and prayer, and much thought and selfâabandonment. I think I can say to
                        those persons here who may be cut the most severely, and to those who are
                        not here to whom my words refer, I could gladly go down at their feet and
                        wash them with my tears, if I could thus bring about a better state of
                        things.</p>
                    <p>I want to remark first, that Jesus Christ came to establish the <emph>kingdom
                            of God upon earth</emph>; that He intended this kingdom to be a literal
                        kingdom, that is, as truly a kingdom as any of the kingdoms of this world;
                        that He intended it to be a holy kingdom, a kingdom of righteousness, and
                        consequently separate from, and above, all other kingdoms; that Christ
                        continually spoke of His followers as a community, existing in the midst of
                        another kingdom or community, having its own laws and principles and aims<pb n="87" xml:id="VAB7129-084"></pb> entirely distinct and separate from the
                        world. He not only made it separate, but He ordained that it should be kept
                        separate, and He did not fail to give the most emphatic cautions and
                        prohibitions against any amalgamation whatever between the forces of His
                        kingdom and the forces of the kingdom of Satan, in the midst of which His
                        kingdom was established.</p>
                    <p>Further, He put forth the claim, as the King and Sovereign of this kingdom,
                        to the highest affection, allegiance, and homage of the hearts of His
                        subjects, representing Himself as a King in a sense entirely beyond and
                        above all earthly sovereigns. He represented Himself as reigning, not by
                        virtue of outward power, but by virtue of the inward love, devotion, and
                        adoration of His subjects; and thus more perfectly and completely over their
                        outward lives than any earthly king could pretend to do.</p>
                    <p>Further, the avowed purpose of Jesus Christ was to propagate and extend this
                        kingdom over the whole earth.</p>
                    <p>In this respect only was He the originator of a new dispensation, for God had
                        already a kingdom in the earth, although it was of a national and sectarian
                        character. Jesus Christ came to break down the walls of partition between
                        Jew and Gentile, and to let out, so to speak, the mercy, goodness, and grace
                        of God to the whole race. Henceforth there was to be âneither Greek nor Jew,
                        ... barbarian, Scythian, bond not free; but Christ is all, and in all.â</p>
                    <p>But as in Adam all had died, so in Christ should all he made alive; as all
                        men had lost their souls in Adam, so all should have the opportunity,
                        subject to that free choice without which either salvation or<pb n="88" xml:id="VAB7129-085"></pb> damnation would be a mere figure of speech, and
                        without which a man would be no more capable of salvation than an
                        ox,âsubject only to such a choice, every son and daughter of Adam should
                        have the provision in Christ of eternal salvation.</p>
                    <p>Then, further, Jesus Christ ordained and arranged that this kingdom of His
                        should be propagated in the world by human instrumentality. Why, we do not
                        know. There might be many reasons, but the main one probably was that the
                        human being, himself transformed, restored to God and to His image, and
                        inspired with His love, would be the most <emph>effectual</emph> ambassador
                        that God could send.</p>
                    <p>Another reason might be that Christ chose to put this honour on His own
                        brethren after the Spiritâthose whom He has redeemed from amongst men, and
                        who have chosen Him as their Sovereign, with His cross and its consequences,
                        in preference to the pleasures, riches, or honours of this world.</p>
                    <p>Or, third, it might be that no other instrumentality would be so calculated
                        to bring glory to His Father, the weakness of the human agent exhibiting
                        most perfectly the excellency of the Divine power.</p>
                    <p>Note further, that the establishment of this kingdom over all the earth
                        means, of course, resistance and opposition from those nations already in
                        possession.</p>
                    <p>And here is a wonderful analogy between the establishment of the kingdom of
                        Christ and the subjugation of Canaan to the Israelites. God had promised
                        that land to Abraham long years before, and spoke of it as already belonging
                        to his descendants; nevertheless they had to go and conquer it in His
                        strength. So God has given the kingdom of this earth to His Son.<pb n="89" xml:id="VAB7129-086"></pb> In the end the kingdoms of this world are to
                        become the kingdoms of our God and of His Christ; but we have to go and
                        conquer them, just as the Israelites had to conquer Canaan, in the faith,
                        and by the strength, of our God. It has only been for want of faith that the
                        world has not been conquered long ago. Oh, what a delusion many Christians
                        labour under with respect to the extension of the kingdom of God! They have
                        a notion that the kingdom is to take the world by stealth; that men are to
                        be turned to God without any connection of means with the event; that it is
                        going to be done by a sort of internal miracle, and the Church has been
                        waiting for this miracle for 1800 years. Consequently the work is not
                            <emph>done</emph>, because this notion is in direct opposition to the
                        orders and ordination of the King. If ever the world is subdued, it will be
                        by His servants carrying out their Lordâs instructions, and setting
                        themselves to subdue it. It will be by bringing all the wisdom, skill, and
                        force of their humanity, allied with divinity, as the early disciples did,
                        and turning that force upon the rebel world. It will be done by <emph>hard,
                            desperate fighting</emph>, if the great fundamental principles laid down
                        in this Bible are to be relied on, and in no other way, because the nations
                        in possession will never let you subdue them and take them for God without
                        opposition. Christ systematically foretold and depicted this opposition, and
                        gave His disciples to understand that they would have to wage <emph rend="sc">WAR</emph> with all the power of those who were possessed of
                        evil, and who were profiting by evil, and that it would be no easy
                        conquest.</p>
                    <p>He told them they would have to go and subdue this evil by good, this
                        unrighteousness by righteousâ<pb n="90" xml:id="VAB7129-087"></pb> ness. The
                        spirit of the devil would have to be driven out of man by the power of the
                        Spirit of God dwelling in <emph>them</emph>. This He taught as plainly and
                        persistently as He taught anything. If we wanted an illustration of the
                        continuance of this spirit of opposition in the earth, we might find it in
                        the events that have lately transpired in Switzerland. A little force of
                        godly people, without any of the peculiarities about which there had been
                        such a hue and cry in England, without an instrument of music, without a
                        banner or flag, or procession, or openâair service, without even a uniform,
                        had only to commence to live Jesus Christ over again, and to carry out His
                        orders in thrusting His claims on their fellowâmen, when wicked rulers
                        combined with those who profit by the vilest kinds of vice to mob them,
                        drive them out, put them down, or kill them, as the case might be. Why?
                        Because the instinct of the evil one recognised the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
                        The devil always knows where the Spirit of Jesus Christ is, and he knows
                        something else; he knows where it is <emph>not</emph>, and where it is not
                        he lets well alone!</p>
                    <p>âOh!â people say, âthe world is different in these days from what it was in
                        the days of Jesus Christ and Paul.â Is it? Try it on the <emph>same
                            lines</emph>, and you will soon find out how far different it is. The
                        very essence of the spirit of evil is antagonistic to the spirit of good.
                        Good and evil are as diametrically opposed to each other as ever; therefore
                        they can never be brought into contact without conflict, without war, and
                        sometimes of the most deadly kind, ending in the death and martyrdom of the
                        saints. I was amused with the exemplification of this some weeks ago. As one
                        of our<pb n="91" xml:id="VAB7129-088"></pb> female officers was walking up
                        Clapton, a band of lads were hooting after her, âHallelujah!â âJesus
                        Christ!â âSalvation!â and other beautiful names; for in whatever voice they
                        be hissed out, they cannot make such words ugly. They were hissing these
                        names after her as she walked meekly and quietly along. At length she turned
                        suddenly to them and said, âWhat are you doing this for? I have never done
                        you any harm. I am walking peaceably along the road; why are you shouting
                        after me?â They were all so taken aback that they stood breathless for a
                        moment, then one of them, I suppose a little bolder than the rest, and at
                        least an honest lad, said, âIt is because you are good and we are bad.â Ah!
                        that was the truth for once. That was the expression, in his rough way, of
                        the eternal principle, that there must be conflict between good and evil;
                        and the greater good you bring in conflict with evil, the more the evil will
                        range and try for the mastery. Hence, the world treated Him who was the very
                        personification of the Fatherâs holiness, worse than it ever treated any
                        other human being, because He was the concentration of goodness, and
                        therefore the devil did his worst on Him; and just as we approximate to His
                        character will the devil do his worst on us.</p>
                    <p>Further, Christ taught His soldiers to expect the opposition of devils.</p>
                    <p>I suppose most of you believe in evil spirits who have access to the human
                        mind. I wish, if you do not, you could have some of the experience of the
                        Salvation Army; I think you would then. If there are evil spirits, if they
                        have access to this world, and if they are interested in circumventing the
                        plans of God, it<pb n="92" xml:id="VAB7129-089"></pb> only stands to sense that
                        they should influence their servants to fight in opposition to the servants
                        of God. This opposition was foretold by Christ, and His servants were warned
                        against it, and provided for it. He said to His apostles when He
                        commissioned them, âBehold, I send you forth as sheep among wolves, but lo,
                        I am with you always.â And again to Paul, I will be with thee, âdelivering
                        thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee.â
                        Why? Because He knew the opposition which their mission would provoke. He
                        said, âThink not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send
                        peace, but a sword.â Wherever the true Christ appears, there must the sword
                        come to the dividing asunder of everything evil, and there must also come
                        the sword of provocation. Even the nearest and dearest relatives rise up to
                        persecute those who truly follow the Christ. This must continue to be so
                        while good and evil continue in contact, and the fact that modern
                        Christianity has ceased, as a rule, to provoke opposition, is one of the
                        deadliest signs of its effeteness. As a rule, the world and modern
                        Christianity go comfortably on together. They are so actuated by one common
                        pathway, that you see very little collision between them. The world alone
                        has very little to complain of, and so it lets them alone. May God help, and
                        quickly mend or end it.</p>
                    <p>Further, I want you to note, that, notwithstanding all the danger involved in
                        this deadly warfare, which Jesus Christ represented it to be,âfor He did not
                        deceive them, but told them plainly that all men would hate them, that they
                        would probably have to follow<pb n="93" xml:id="VAB7129-090"></pb> Him to
                        martyrdom and death,ânevertheless, they accepted the mission. I grant that
                        they were a little time in coming to comprehend it; I grant that it took
                        some time to free them from their national and sectarian prejudices. Peter
                        had to receive his lesson through the visions of the sheet let down from
                        heaven, before he understood the true genus of his mission. But when he and
                        the other apostles did comprehend it,âand that was the difference between
                        them and modern apostles,âwhen they saw the work to which the Master called
                        them, they joyfully embraced it. They did not stop to confer with flesh and
                        blood, or to reason what it would cost them, to ask about salaries, or
                        houses, or friends; they embraced the mission and went, and carried it out
                        with their lives in their hands; and oh, how magnificently they succeeded!
                        What a large portion of the world they subdued in comparison with their
                        numbers and facilities, for, remember, there were no railways in those days
                        to speed them from town to town, and city to city; there were no telegraphs
                        to fly before them with their announcements; no printing presses to herald
                        their coming with posters and handbills and all manner of notices: they had
                        none of the facilities which we possess in these days for quickening their
                        speed, or how gladly would they have availed themselves of them! What
                        gigantic success they attained, because they carried out their mission on
                        the lines which Jesus Christ had laid down. Is it not true that just in
                        proportion as their successors have followed in their steps, they have been
                        successful in propagating the gospel? We all know that the stars in the
                        heavenly firmament, the men and women whose names stand out with extra
                        brilliancy on the<pb n="94" xml:id="VAB7129-091"></pb> page of history, as
                        having been successful in pushing this glorious warfare, have been the men
                        and women who took their lives in their hands, and followed their Master
                        without respect to consequences; who came out straight and <emph>clear from
                            the world</emph> and set themselves to do their work, irrespective of
                        what men might say or do to them. And we know what mighty conquests some of
                        them achieved, and therefore we may reason that if all Christâs professed
                        disciples had followed in the same track, a million times greater results
                        would have been attained.</p>
                    <p>Let me put a practical question here. How many are there here who have
                        comprehended the task? How many are there to whom the Spirit of God has said
                        in unmistakable language, âCome out from amongst the ungodly or the
                        halfâhearted, and be separate, and I will touch your lips with a live coal
                        from off My altar, and will make you fishers of menâ? Did you embrace the
                        mission? Have you gone forth following your Master, carrying His cross and
                        seeking the souls of men? If not, what will you say to Him in the great day
                        of account?</p>
                    <p>Further, in looking at the requirements of the King, and at the history of
                        the early apostles and disciples, I charge it on modern Christianity, that
                        its professors do not even <emph>comprehend the first principles of this
                            warfare</emph>, much less do they set themselves to carry it on to the
                        ends of the earth.</p>
                    <p>The service rendered to the King and to the kingdom in these days is, alas,
                        with very few exceptions, of a very milkâandâwatery type, of a very
                        shortâweight character, and the great effort of the majority of its
                        teachers, judging from their writings, and from what<pb n="95" xml:id="VAB7129-092"></pb> we see and know of their public services and of
                        their private lives, seems to be intended to make things comfortable all
                        around. âPeace, peace,â is the continual cry, when there is no peace. As one
                        of the bishops said a little while ago, âWe hear a great deal about Church
                        defence; we ought to be hearing about Church aggression.â Yes, alas! in the
                        great mass if instances when these modern Christians do fight, it is over
                        opinions and ceremonies with their own children, inside their own walls,
                        instead of with the enemy outside. They are far more valiant in defending
                        some ceremonial of the Church, than they are in defending the cross of
                        Christ in the presence of its adversaries. They are far more concerned in
                        propagating their âismâ than the kingdom of righteousness, peace, and joy in
                        the Holy Ghost. Alas, that it should be so; but such is the fact, and it is
                        patent to every enlightened observer.</p>
                    <p>Jesus Christ did not call us to fight each other, but He called us to present
                        one bold front to the enemy. He bade us go and take captive the hearts and
                        souls of men, and not merely to change their <emph>opinions</emph>. Get a
                        manâs heart right, and his opinions will soon follow. But you may be
                        tinkering at his intellect till the hour of his death, and he will not be a
                        whit nearer heaven, but perchance nearer hell, than if he had been let
                        alone.</p>
                    <p>Further, these modern Christians, as a rule, do not see any <emph rend="sc">NEED</emph>
                        <emph>for the fight</emph>.</p>
                    <p>They hide themselves under some vain, false notions of the sovereignty of
                        God. Oh, how often they have made my heart ache when I have been trying to
                        arouse them to do something for the kingdom. They<pb n="96" xml:id="VAB7129-093"></pb> say, âGod is a sovereign, and He will accomplish
                        His purposes out of all this sin and ruin;â and so they sit comfortably down
                        and let things drift; and they have drifted to some purpose, have they not?
                        In this soâcalled Christian country, in this nineteenth century, they have
                        drifted to about as near perdition as they well could, without absolutely
                        bringing hell on the earth. They have drifted socially as well as
                        spiritually. Look at the state of the nation. Look at the godlessness, the
                        injustice, the falseness, the blasphemy, the uncleanness and the debauchery
                        everywhere! Do you ever look at the condition of things close to your doors
                        and your churches? the worse than heathen beastliness into which thousands
                        of our neglected neighbors, rich and poor alike, have sunk? If only half the
                        professing Christians of London had followed in their Masterâs steps for one
                        twelve months, such things would have been impossible, utterly
                        impossible!</p>
                    <p>I repeat, Jesus Christ has ordained and provided that His people are to set
                        themselves to stem these torrents of moral and social pollution; they are to
                        go and beard the lion in his den; to face the slaves of sin, open their
                        eyes, and bring them down to His feet, just as much as were His early
                        followers; and never till we do it shall we realize a better state of
                        things. All the legislation, education, or provision of better dwellings, as
                        I shall hereafter try to demonstrate, wonât touch the moral cancer, the
                        spring of all this wickedness and misery; nothing will do it until the
                        Christians rise up to do their Masterâs bidding. But I say, they do not see
                        any need for it, and they try to quiet us who do. You have to prove, and
                        argue, and drive,<pb n="97" xml:id="VAB7129-094"></pb> and almost show them
                        damnation before you can get a bit of service of any sort of them. They have
                        no <emph>heart</emph> for the fight. They do not <emph>feel</emph> these
                        things. As God said of the fallen and false prophets of the Jews, âThey lay
                        not these things to their hearts.â They lay their own business to their
                        hearts. You see it depicted on the countenances of these Christian men if
                        the balance is on the wrong side; if bankruptcy stares them in the face, you
                        soon find that out. These Christian women lay the welfare of their own
                        families or their hearts; you soon find out when a child is sick, or in any
                        kind of disgrace or danger. But these same men and women can walk about the
                        walls and see the desolations of Zion without any of these marks of distress
                        or apprehension, without any such tears or groans.</p>
                    <p>They will manifest more anger against the people who urge them to fight, than
                        they will against the enemy. A great many of them hate the Salvation Army
                        for this more than for any other thing. They say âYou are always at us: let
                        us alone, we want peace.â They want to be quiet and comfortable, and to have
                        their religion in a snug, backâparlour fashion. Fight! they hate the name of
                        fighting. Going out to face a mob! oh dear no, that is out of all question.
                        How could you ever think of such a thing. Being mocked, and spit upon, and
                        kicked, and buffetted, and perchance killed for Christ! they would think you
                        were clean gone made. Some of these modern Christians have tried to put two
                        or three of our people into asylums for nothing else. The moment anybody
                        attempts really to obey Jesus Christ, they cry, âMad! mad! away with such a
                        fellow; he is not fit to live.â<pb n="98" xml:id="VAB7129-095"></pb> What a
                        veritable laughingâstock to hell such professed Christians make themselves.
                        The devil says, âAll right; let them alone. Let them go to their
                        sanctuaries, let them have their creeds and ceremonies, let them sing their
                        sweet hymns, and amuse themselves with their religious entertainments and
                        their Bible classes; do not disturb them whatever you do, they are amongst
                        my best and most successful allies.â Oh, may God show us these things, and
                        help us to set work to awaken every backslidden, lazy professor within reach
                        of us.</p>
                    <p>Many of these latter day Christians are most zealous in building the
                        sepulchres of the prophets, that is, of the saintsâthe spiritual warriors of
                        bygone times. They are often great at lectures on these ancient
                        worthiesâLuther, George Fox, Wesley, and others, and they will listen most
                        interestedly to a dissertation on their heroism, just as they would listen
                        to a lecture on Shakespeare or Milton; but as to <emph>imitating</emph>
                        their deeds of valour, it never enters their minds any more than if they had
                        been inhabitants of another sphere. They simply go, in the great mass of
                        instances, to have their intellects amused, their feelings tickled. It never
                        dawns on them that <emph>they</emph> are to go and imitate the example of
                        these heroes. They do not perceive that it ought equally to be the absorbing
                        interest of <emph>their own</emph> lives, and that they are equally called
                        to brave men and devils in propagating the kingdom of Christ in the earth.
                        They go home and live the coming week exactly as they lived the week that
                        preceded it. They admire the men who laid down their lives for the King a
                        hundred or three hundred years ago, and will perhaps put up a monument to
                        their memory, but as to<pb n="99" xml:id="VAB7129-096"></pb> doing so
                        themselves, or allowing themselves to come into the same circumstances of
                        persecution, they would soon almost go to hell. I speak the things I know
                        and have witnessed till my heart is sick.</p>
                    <p>Further, I charge it on popular Christianity that its professors are
                            <emph>ashamed of their colours</emph> in the presence of the enemy.</p>
                    <p>They shrink from any open, straightforward confession of Christ before men. I
                        maintain that it is not confessing Him to go to church or chapel once a week
                        amongst those who go the same way with you. They do not confess Him on the
                        exchange, in the bank, or in the streets of the city. Where do you see any
                        one, or only on in a million, who comes out with any thoroughâgoing,
                        straightforward confession of Christ before the world? Where? There are a
                        few Roman Catholic or high Church monastics, and whatever I may think of
                        their errors and their mummeries, I always feel a measure of reverence when
                        I pass them. I feel there is a man or woman who is willing to acknowledge
                        his God before men, and who is not ashamed to come out and condemn the
                        world, by being separate from it, and entering a protest against its
                        fashions and its follies.</p>
                    <p>How many professing Christians are there of this day who go through the city
                        of London in any attire, or with any kind of badge, that said to men and
                        women, âI am a saint and a soldier of Jesus Christâ? And yet the soldiers of
                        the queen are proud to do this in an enemyâs country! I repeat, who is there
                        that dare do it for Christ, except we fanatics of the Salvation Army?</p>
                    <p>I understand that a popular minister said the other<pb n="100" xml:id="VAB7129-097"></pb> day, speaking of the Salvation Army, that we were
                        âplaying at soldiers!â I will engage to say that if that minister will come
                        with us for a single day, we will give him such a dose of fighting as he
                        never had in his life before. We will send him home at night quite convinced
                        that it is no playing at soldiers on our part. If he does not get his head
                        broken, we will guarantee that his coat will be torn, or covered with mud or
                        ochre, or something worse!</p>
                    <p>Playing at soldiers indeed! Let him doff his kid gloves, his gentlemanâs
                        attire, and lay aside his <emph>cigar</emph>, and come with our lasses into
                        the publicâhouses with the <bibl rend="i"><title>War Cry</title></bibl> or a
                            <bibl rend="i"><title>Bible</title></bibl> under his arm, or anything else that tells
                        the inmates what he has come for, and he will find out whether we are
                        playing at soldiers or not! I would like to put that man alongside one of
                        our dear little female captains in a certain jail just now, and see whether
                        such an experience, even for twentyâfour hours, would not change his
                        opinion. Such cruel stabs from professed Christian ministers are worse than
                        the cruel mockings and scourgings of the enemy. âMay the Lord not lay this
                        sin to their charge.â But to return to this shameâfacedness in the Masterâs
                        cause: it is time we had done with it; it is time we proclaimed ourselves;
                        for we speak to numbers by our appearance to whom we can never speak by our
                        words, and unless we confess Christ in our appearance in such instances, we
                        cannot confess Him at all. Besides, why should we be ashamed of it? Why? The
                        other day when I was driving though a low thoroughfare of London, and the
                        little urchins were crying after me, one âJesus!â another, âHallelujah!â and
                        a third, âThere goes the Salvation Army!â I felt my soul<pb n="101" xml:id="VAB7129-098"></pb> glow with holy joy as I thought of the words,
                        âThe reproaches of them that reproached Thee fell on me.â</p>
                    <p>I do not care what kind of a garb or a badge you wear,âthat is not the point,
                        but there ought to be a badge which says to every man and woman, âI belong
                        to Jesus Christ, and I am not ashamed of my colours.â</p>
                    <p>Any profession if Jesus Christ which <emph>brings no cross</emph> is all
                        nonsense; it is not <emph>confession at all</emph>. There are plenty of
                        Christians very brave inside their churches in the presence of their
                        friends, or on parade. They sing:â <q>
                            <l>âAm I a soldier of the crossâ</l>
                        </q> or <q>
                            <l>âHold the fort, for I am coming.â</l>
                        </q></p>
                    <p>I was once in a large congregation where they were singing this with the
                        greatest gusto:â <q>
                            <l>âWave the answer back to heaven,</l>
                            <l rend="ti-1">âBy Thy grace we will.ââ</l>
                        </q> I was sitting beside a warrior of the cross, one who carried the marks
                        of many a desperate battle on his worn face. I whispered, âWhat should you
                        think this peopleâs conception of holding the fort is?â and he whispered
                        back, âA sevenâandâsixpenny pew!â Alas how true, in hundreds of instances.
                        Are there any ministers here? If so, I ask you, Is it not <emph>true</emph>
                        of three parts of your congregations? What do the people in your pews mean
                        by holding down the fort? What fort do they hold? They hold the fort
                        valiantly on the stock exchange, in the bank, at the office, or behind the
                        counter. Let anybody go and try to get the better of them there, and they
                        will hold that<pb n="102" xml:id="VAB7129-099"></pb> fort valiantly enough; but
                        what fort are they holding for Jesus Christ? Here are two men, one is a
                        professing Christian, the other an honourable man of the world. They are
                        both, we will suppose, in the same business. Take their lives from day to
                        day, and what is the difference between them? The one goes to church or
                        chapel once or twice on Sunday. On the week day he gets up in the morning
                        and has his breakfast, and perhaps he reads prayers out of a book, or
                        perhaps not; this done and away he rushes to the city, to the business,
                        where he works and thinks and plans with untiring energy till evening to
                        make money. This is what he does six days in the week, without giving one
                        hour per day to any kind of service to God or humanity, or even to the
                        affairs of his own or his childrenâs souls. The other man does just the
                        same, only he does no go to church on Sunday, or read prayers. If you look
                        into the lives of these two men at the end of the week, you canât find that
                        the professed Christian has done one iota for the kingdom of God more than
                        the other. You canât find that he has spoken to any one about his soul: he
                        would think it out of season to talk about religion in the shop, the
                        counting house, or on the exchange. He has never buttonâholed any of his
                        acquaintances or friends in his own house; he has never knelt down by the
                        side of any poor wandering brother or sister, never visited any sick one or
                        prayed with the dying; he has not done a thing for the Lord Jesus, and yet
                        he will go to chapel and sing, âHold the fortâ on Sunday, as though he had
                        been living the life of a saint all the week. I ask, Why should such a man
                        be called a Christian any more than his neighbour over the way?<pb n="103" xml:id="VAB7129-100"></pb> Oh, friends, it is time we wiped away this
                        reproach, and put it out of the power of infidels and atheists to wag their
                        heads and say, âWhat do ye more than the others?â It is time we drummed out
                        of the professed armies of our Lord all such renegades or hypocrites!</p>
                    <p>Further, the great mass of these modern Christians cannot enter into this
                        fight because they <emph rend="sc">REFUSE TO BEAR THE
                        CONSEQUENCES</emph>.</p>
                    <p>Fighting is hard work, whatever sort of fighting it is. You cannot fight
                        without wounds of body, heart, or soul. You cannot be a soldier without
                        enduring â<emph>hardness</emph>,â and genteel Christians donât like
                        hardnessâthey wonât have the consequences.</p>
                    <p>First, they wonât <emph>lose their reputation</emph>; they wonât be counted
                        fools and fanatics. I was thinking the other day, if we could have a list of
                        the names of every person, high and low, rich and poor, who has ever been to
                        the meetings of the Salvation Army, and who has received light and truth,
                        and been called and claimed by God for this war, but who has gone back into
                        the wilderness, <emph>what a list</emph> that would be! And more than half
                        of this drawing back has been because people have been ashamed to own where
                        they got their blessing, or where they might have had it. Friends, the
                        recording angel <emph>keeps such a list</emph>! A gentleman answered the
                        other day, when bewailing his miserable spiritual condition, and one of our
                        friends asked him to go to a holiness meeting, â<emph>Not in my own
                            town</emph>.â If he had been in London, and could have crept in with the
                        crowd into the great Congress Hall, where nobody would have recognised him,
                        he would have gone, but <emph>not in his own town</emph>. That reveals the
                        secret of thousands of people having<pb n="104" xml:id="VAB7129-101"></pb>
                        resisted the light, and lost the blessing they might have had. It was the
                        same spirit of false shame which prompted the question of the Pharisees,
                        âHave any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on Him?â</p>
                    <p>My brother, my sister, listen:âwhile you care what any man or woman on earth
                        thinks about you, or the instruments used of God to bless you, never expect
                        to keep your blessing, for you never will. That man will go blundering on in
                        his present lean and skeleton condition to the grave, and probably into
                        hell, unless he repents, and finds out his mistake, and does his first
                        works. Ashamed!âWonât be thought fanatical or weak, wonât be mixed up with
                        these common people. âNot in my own town, not in my own family,ââtoo proud
                        to confess that I am not just what I should be, and that I am going amongst
                        those poor people to be made better. Oh, dear no, not if heaven depended
                        upon it. Listen! âWhosoever therefore shall be ashamed of Me and of My
                        words, of him also shall the Son of Man be ashamed, when He cometh in the
                        glory of His Father with the holy angels.â</p>
                    <p>Then, further, these modern Christians refuse to <emph>give their
                            substance</emph> to carry on the war.</p>
                    <p>You see war is impossible without money. I wish it were not so, but I cannot
                        help it. This war is as impossible as any other, without money. Men and
                        women must eat to live, however little they may manage with. And travelling
                        expenses, rent of buildings, announcements, working expenses, prosecutions,
                        breakdown through sickness, etc., etc., must be met. This war, I say, must
                        have money, <emph rend="sc">AND THE MORE WAR THE MORE MONEY IS
                        WANTED</emph>. How many of these<pb n="105" xml:id="VAB7129-102"></pb> mongrel
                        Christians, when faced with the needs of the warâchest, exclaim, âMoney
                        again! always begging.â Now contrast the feelings of these same people when
                        there is any great popular national war on foot. Then, what do they say in
                        their newspapers, in their public meetings? They say to their statesmen:
                        âYou must ask for grants; you must not stick fast for money. We must win.
                        John Bull must not be beaten for the sake of a few millions!â Ah, ah! their
                            <emph>hearts</emph> are in <emph>this</emph> warfare! The women would
                        sell their ornaments, and the men would hand over their balances, rather
                        than Englandâs freedom or greatness be sacrificed. Now then, I say that if
                        the Christians of this London and this England of ours had the true war
                        spirit, the spirit which says, âI want the world for Christ Jesus: I want my
                        King to reign over the hearts of men: He shall win, be it at the cost of
                        money or blood, or all else,ââif this spirit possessed them, instead of
                        begrudging and reckoning how little they could give, and how much would save
                        appearances, they would try how far they could deny themselves, and how much
                        they could give. Oh! is this not true? Can you contradict it? Then, what am
                        I to think of a band of professed soldiers who are always grumbling about
                        having to give their money to extend the reign of their king, whom they
                        profess to love more than all else besides! I do not propose to dwell on the
                        beggarly subterfuges for getting money which these Christians resort to; it
                        would make my cheeks crimson with shame. I said to a lady a little while
                        ago, who was working an elaborate piece of embroidery for a bazaar, âWhy
                        donât you give the money, and use your time for something<pb n="106" xml:id="VAB7129-103"></pb> better?â She answered, âThis will sell for more
                        than it costs.â âThen reckon what it will sell for and give the money; donât
                        sit at home making other peopleâs finery, instead of visiting the sick and
                        seeking to save the lost!â It makes me burn with shame to think how money is
                        raised for soâcalled religious purposes by semiâworldly concerts,
                        entertainments, penny readings, and bazaars, at which there is frequently
                        positive <emph>gambling</emph> to raise money for Jesus Christ, whom they
                        say they love more than fathers, mothers, husbands, wives, houses, or lands,
                        or anything else on earth! And these are the people who accuse the Salvation
                        Army of want of reverence! I have sometimes talked to ladies when they have
                        been expensively dressed, and they have said, âReally, I do not care for
                        these things.â âThen,â I have said, âit is passing strange that you should
                        be willing to spend your money for them. People generally care for the
                        things they pay for.â If Christians really cared for the reign of Jesus
                        Christ over the hearts of men, if their hearts were set on His kingdom and
                        on doing all they possibly could to extend it, if it were the highest
                        ambition of their souls, the waking and sleeping idea of their minds, do you
                        think they would grudge to pay for it? Oh no; any child knows they would
                        not. Such professed concern is a mockery!</p>
                    <p>Further, these modern Christians refuse to give <emph>themselves or their
                            children</emph> to the propagation of the kingdom.</p>
                    <p>They studiously bring up their children from three or four years of age to
                        eighteen or twenty, grinding it into them every day of their lives, for six
                        and eight hours a day, how to get on and up in this world; but<pb n="107" xml:id="VAB7129-104"></pb> when Jesus Christ wants one of themâespecially if
                        he or she happens to be cleverâto do any unpopular, or, in the eyes of the
                        world, vulgar work for Himâany work that will bring a crossâthey consider it
                        absolutely throwing that child away. All the ordinary silly, sickly circles
                        of gossip, and croquet, and drawingâroom occupations, are considered most
                        respectable and satisfactory in the case of young girls, alongside of any
                        one of them giving herself up to seek and to save the lost. I heard a young
                        lady say of a large circle of Christian friends: âWhile I was in frivolity
                        and sin they all let me alone; I never had a letter, that I remember, from
                        any one of them about my soul; but as soon as they found out that I had
                        given myself to work amongst the poor and the lost, then they all woke up to
                        a deep concern about my future, and I was flooded with letters from these
                            <emph>Christian friends</emph>!â Oh! what do you think Jesus Christ
                        would say to such people? Would He not say, as He said of their
                        representatives, the Pharisees, âWell hath Esaias prophesied of you
                        hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, but
                        their heart is far from Me.â Why should that daughter be thought thrown way
                        who comes out and chooses a voluntary poverty and humility, and becomes a
                        salvation officer to win poor lost men and women, for whom you say Jesus
                        Christ shed His blood? If they were worth His blood, surely they are worth
                        your daughterâs respectability! Then why, because she chooses to sacrifice
                        it, should she be put at a disadvantage compared with her elder or younger
                        sisters, who spend their time in the frivolities of the world? Answer all ye
                        parents, professed followers of the despised Nazarene!</p>

                    <p>Oh, the stories I could unfold, the dozens of letters that could be produced,
                        pleading with young men and women whose hearts God has touched with pity for
                        the perishing multitudes; bringing all the considerations of family ties,
                        worldly position, future prospects, wealthy alliances, and I know not what
                        else, in order to induce them to turn aside from the path of selfâsacrifice
                        and wholeâhearted abandonment to the interests of the kingdom. I sometimes
                        wonder that Christian parents and friends dare utter such words or pen such
                        letters. I wonder that the ink does not turn red as they write, and that
                        their accusing consciences do not force them to sign their letters
                        âJudas.â</p>
                    <p>What a different spirit parents and friends manifest with respect to their
                        children and wards when the warâfever seizes the nation! Mothers give their
                        sonsâit may be with tears and heartachesânevertheless ungrudgingly, to face
                        the horrors of foreign warfare, in the shape of loneliness, toil, long
                        marchings, exposure, privation, fever, dysentery, and a desolate death; and
                        in other instances to wounds, loss of limbs, enfeebled constitutions, or
                        violent death. Nay, women themselves have gone to such a war with the
                        bravery of men, making lint, nursing the wounded, and inspiring the weak or
                        wavering, and even working the guns; and as one rank has fallen, others have
                        rushed to fill up the bleeding gaps. But is it so in this warfare? It used
                        to be. No grander enthusiasm, no more heroic selfâsacrifice, no more
                        determined abandonment, has ever fired human souls than has been exhibited
                        in the cause of Jesus Christ; but alas! it is a long while ago. The
                        Christians of this age, as a rule, want all their time, strength, and
                        ability, and<pb n="109" xml:id="VAB7129-106"></pb> that of their children also,
                        to enable them to climb up the ladder of this worldâs social position; to
                        get <emph>up</emph>, <emph rend="sc">UP</emph>, from whence Godâif Christâs
                        teaching means anythingâwill say, âThou fool!â and hurl them down to
                        perdition when they have done.</p>
                    <p>Friends, is it not true? If so, we ought to go down on our faces and weep,
                        and have a confession serviceâfirst, for those who feel that this truth
                        applies to themselves; and second, for those who, although their own
                        consciences acquit them, know that it applies to thousands round about us.
                        Like the prophets of old did, let us humble ourselves for the sins of our
                        people. Let us take their iniquities on our hearts as far as we may, weep
                        over them, confess for them, and pray for them, and then set ourselves to
                        try to arouse them up to a sense of their responsibility and danger.</p>
                    <p>Further, I charge it on the professors of popular Christianity that they have
                        no <emph>valour in the fight</emph> for truth and for God.</p>
                    <p>They hold not fast the faith once delivered to the saints, but surrender
                        first one point then another of Godâs revelation to any sceptical heathen
                        who may see fit to attack it. They bid God speed alike to all professed
                        prophets and creeds, simply because it is a matter of indifference with them
                        wither truth or error shall prevail; in fact, they are most tolerant of
                        false teachers because they propound the easiest doctrine, often patronising
                        the most monstrous contradictions and shameless caricatures of the gospel.
                        There can be no doubt that millions of souls are being sacrificed to the
                        godless, senseless antinomian gospels of the present day, gospels which have
                        been hacked<pb n="110" xml:id="VAB7129-107"></pb> and hewed worse than any poor
                        vivisected animal. The very standards and landmarks of goodness, truth,
                        honesty, chastity, and godliness are broken down, and the people are taught
                        that they have nothing to do, to sacrifice, or to suffer, in order to be
                        saved and to get into heaven; in fact, that they can get there as easily by
                        the broad road as by the narrow way; and all who preach the truth as Christ
                        preached it are stigmatized as legalâas workmongers, as antichrists and
                        papists.</p>
                    <p>Further, these modern Christians lack all <emph>enthusiasm</emph> in the
                        warfare.</p>
                    <p>Look at their poor, grasping, halfâhearted, uncertain profession of personal
                        religion. They condemn anybody who dares get up and tell out any definite
                        change that God has wrought in them, or of any glowing experience of the
                        love, sufficiency, and power of Christ to save. They characterise all such
                        testimony as selfâexaultation and vainglory, whereas they ought to know that
                        one of the main purposes of Christ in establishing a kingdom on the earth
                        was that His servants might be His witnessesânot witnesses merely of His
                        existence, but of His <emph>power to save from sin</emph> and its
                        consequences. They should also study the writings of Paul, whom they claim
                        as their great apostle, and note his bold, comprehensive, and persistent
                        expression of his own personal experience, which occupies so large a share
                        of his epistles.</p>
                    <p>Look at the cold, stiff, stilted public service of these modern Christians;
                        note how they pray, sitting looking about, without reverence or decency,
                        while their ministers pray for them by proxy; listen to their songs, mostly
                        sung by a few dressedâup dolls perched in an organâloft or singingâpew,
                        doing their praises for<pb n="111" xml:id="VAB7129-108"></pb> them, perhaps with
                        a profane or drunken leader at so much a year. Listen to the preaching,âas a
                        rule, cold dissertations and abstractions or platitudes, âmoving not a hair
                        of the polished divineâ who utters them, nor of the people who listen. An
                        amen or hallelujah would sound almost as much out of place as it would be on
                        the gallows! Who would ever imagine that such a minister and such
                        worshippers were professedly serving Him of whom it was said, âHe shall
                        baptize you with the Holy Ghost with <emph>fire</emph>â? Alas, alas! such
                        worshippers have nothing to be enthusiastic about. They have no personal
                        participation in the Spirit or purposes of their professed Lord, no
                        realization of His presence, and no glowing anticipation of His predicted
                        triumphs. But watch the change when the time for dismissal comes; see the
                        rush of acquaintances at the church or chapel doors to shake hands with one
                        another; listen to the rush of tongues;âthere is plenty of enthusiasm now!
                        Frankâs prizes at school or honours at college, Harryâs promotion in the
                        killing army, Gertrudeâs recent engagement, or Lizzieâs new baby,âthese are
                        topics in which the heart is interested, and so the tongue is inspired, and
                        the soul comes forth from its lethargy! Alas for the little children who
                        watch the altered countenances and listen to the interested tone and manner
                        of mother and father during the progress of these congratulations! No wonder
                        if they conclude that <emph>this</emph> is the reality, and what they have
                        been witnessing in the church or chapel is a sham. No wonder such a
                        Christianity cannot hold its own against the forces of the enemy; no cause
                        is so hopeless as one without enthusiasm. People who do not care much are
                        sure to go to the wall.</p>
                    <pb n="112" xml:id="VAB7129-109"></pb>
                    <p>Further, I charge these modern Christians with a lack of missionary
                        enterprise.</p>
                    <p>No wonder, if they reason from the value and effect of their religion on
                        their own characters and lives, that they do not see the importance of
                        sending it to the heathen; and from all accounts it does no more for the
                        heathen abroad that for the Christians at home. Alas, alas! on all these
                        points popular Christianity must be confessed, when weighed in the balances
                        of the sanctuary, to be found lamentably wanting.</p>
                    <p>Friends, what about yours?</p>
                </div>
                <div type="section">
                    <head>The Real Warfare.</head>
                    <p>We will now glance at two or three of the main characteristics of that
                        warfare to which Christ has called His soldiers.</p>
                    <p>First: Christâs soldiers must be imbued with <emph>the spirit</emph> of the
                        war.</p>
                    <p>Love to the King and concern for His interests must be the master passion of
                        the soul. All outward effort, even that which springs from a sense of duty,
                        will fail without this. The hardship and suffering involved in real
                        spiritual warfare are too great for any motive but that of love. It is said
                        that one of the soldiers of Napoleon, when being operated upon for the
                        extraction of a bullet, exclaimed, âCut a little deeper and you will find my
                        generalâs name,â meaning that it was engraven on his heart. So must the
                        image and glory of Christ be engraven on the heart of every successful
                        soldier of Christ. It must be the allâsubduing passion of his life to bring
                        the reign of Jesus Christ over the hearts and souls of men.<pb n="113" xml:id="VAB7129-110"></pb> A little child who has this spirit will subjugate
                        others to his King, while the most talented and learned and active, without
                        it, will accomplish comparatively little. If the hearts of the Christians of
                        this generation were inspired with this spirit, and set on winning the world
                        for God, we should soon see nations shaken to their centre, and millions of
                        souls translated into the kingdom.</p>
                    <p>Secondly: The soldiers of Christ must be <emph>abandoned to the
                        war.</emph></p>
                    <p>They must be thoroughly committed to Godâs side: there can be no neutrals in
                        this warfare. When the soldier enlists and takes the queenâs shilling, he
                        ceases to be his own property, but becomes the property of his country, must
                        go where he is sent, stand at any post to which he is assigned, even if it
                        be at the cannonâs mouth. He gives up the ways and comforts of civilians,
                        and goes forth with his life in his hand, in obedience to the will of his
                        sovereign.</p>
                    <p>If I understand it, that is just what Jesus Christ demands of every one of
                        His soldiers, and nothing less.</p>
                    <p>Some one may ask, âBut we cannot all be ministers, or missionaries, or
                        officers in the Salvation Army; must we not attend to the avocations of this
                        life, and work for the bread that perisheth for ourselves and our families?â
                        Certainly, but the great <emph>end</emph> in all we do must be the promotion
                        of the kingdom. A man may work in order that he may eat, but he must eat to
                        live, not to himself or for the promotion of his own purposes, but for his
                        King, and for the advancement of His interests; and if his heart is really
                        set on this, he will have no desire to work at his secular calling longer
                        than is absolutely necessary to promote this<pb n="114" xml:id="VAB7129-111"></pb> object. When the necessary amount of work is done, he will gladly lay
                        aside his implements of husbandry or handicraft for the sword of the Spirit,
                        and for the conflict with ignorance, vice, and misery. Instead of spending
                        his evenings in ease and selfâindulgence, he will betake of himself to the
                        streets or other places of resort for the people, and will spend what would
                        have been his leisure hours in pressing on them the claims of God and of His
                        truth. There will be no running away, no forsaking of the cross, no
                        shrinking from the hard places of the field; but a determined pushing of the
                        battle to the gate, even amid weariness, opposition, and sometimes in the
                        face of dire defeat. I ask, Was it any less a devotion than this which
                        actuated the martyrs and confessors of old? Have I depicted an abandonment
                        greater than that which they understood to be their duty and privilege? If
                        they might have drawn back, why did they persevere, many of them, through
                        long years of conflict and persecution, culminating in stripes,
                        imprisonment, and death? It is evident that <emph>they</emph> understood
                        fidelity to Christ to involve the most perfect selfâabandonment, both in
                        life and in death.</p>
                    <p>Then, third: Christâs soldiers must <emph>understand the tactics of
                            war</emph>.</p>
                    <p>In order to do this, they must make it a subject of earnest and prayerful
                        study how to make the most of their time, talents, money, or any other
                        resources which God may have placed at their command for the advancement of
                        the kingdom. They must think and scheme how best to attack the enemy. Only
                        think of the time, trouble, skill, and money that are expended by great
                        killing armies in planning for stratagem and<pb n="115" xml:id="VAB7129-112"></pb> manÅuvre in order to surprise and overcome their enemies. Some of you
                        will remember reading, in the records of the last German and French war,
                        that the German officers were better acquainted with the geography of France
                        that the French themselves; they knew every road, byâway, and field, likely
                        to be available for their purposes. Think of the time and trouble that must
                        have been expended in becoming thus familiar with a foreign country, and
                        compare this with the haphazard, ruleâofâthumb kind of way in which
                        spiritual warfare is for the most part conducted. Think of the undigested
                        schemes and abortive plans, throwing away both labour and money, embarked in
                        by professed Christian soldiers, who have never, perhaps, spent a dayâs
                        anxious thought and prayer over them in their lives. Think also of the
                        shameful indifferenceâwhich cannot be characterised as warfare at allâof the
                        ordinary services and arrangements of the churches. It often makes my heart
                        ache as I pass some stately, closedâup church or chapel, with its antiquated
                        board with a shameâfaced, insignificant announcement that the âReverend
                        Soâandâso will preach,â or a âGospel address will be deliveredâ at such a
                        time on such a day; in which it is evident nothing is contemplated beyond
                        securing the eye and attention of those who already have a liking for going
                        to churches or chapels. And as I sometimes read the lists of meetings
                        connected with ordinary churches, I say to myself, âAs it was in the
                        beginning, is now, and ever shall be,â is evidently the creed of the
                        originators of this programme, not with respect, perhaps, to the doctrines
                        they preach, but with respect to the oldâfashioned, effete methods by which
                        they conâ<pb n="116" xml:id="VAB7129-113"></pb> tinue to publish them. Oh, is it
                        not time that the professed children of light should learn, as the great
                        Captain of our salvation exhorted them, wisdom by contrast with the children
                        of darkness?</p>
                    <p>As I heard some friends talking the other day about the rescue of Gordon, and
                        listened to their calculations as to the probably cost being some millions
                        of money, and perhaps thousands of lives, I could not help thinking, yes,
                        and I suppose all England (the Christians included) will think this quite a
                        legitimate expenditure of both money and life to rescue this one man and the
                        little band who is with him; and yet, if we were to ask for a few millions
                        of money, and propose to sacrifice a few hundreds of lives in the rescue of
                        millions of the human race from a bondage of misery and destruction ten
                        thousand times more appalling than that which threatens General Gordon, they
                        would call us mad enthusiasts and senseless fanatics. Alas, alas! we may
                        well ask, Where is the zeal of the Christians of this generation for the
                        Lord of hosts? How much do they care about His reign over the hearts of
                        their fellowâmen? What is their appreciation of the present and eternal
                        benefits embraced in His salvation; or what is their estimate of the âcrown
                        of lifeâ which He promises to give to every one of His conquering
                        soldiers?</p>
                    <p>Fourth: The soldiers of Christ must <emph>believe in victory</emph>.</p>
                    <p>Faith in victory is an indispensable condition to successful warfare of any
                        kind. It is universally recognised by generals of killing armies, that if
                        the enthusiasm of expected conquest be destroyed, and their troops imbued
                        with fear and doubt as to the ultimate result, defeat is all but certain.
                        This is<pb n="117" xml:id="VAB7129-114"></pb> equally true with respect to
                        spiritual warfare, hence the repeated and comprehensive assurance and
                        promises of victory from the great Captain of our salvation.</p>
                    <p>The true soldier of Christ, who has the spirit of the war and who is
                        abandoned to its interests, has an earnest in his soul of coming victory. He
                        knows it is only a question of time, <emph>and time is nothing to
                            love</emph>! As he is lying in the trenches, or taking long marches, or
                        suffering for the want of common necessaries, or enduring the sharpest
                        bayonets or heaviest fire of the enemy, or lying wounded, overcome by
                        fatigue, pressed by discouragement, realizing the greatness of the conflict
                        in contrast with his own weaknessâin the very darkest hours and severest
                        straits, he has the herald of coming victory sounding in his ears. The
                        faithful soldier <emph>knows</emph> that he shall win, and that his King
                        will ultimately reign, not only over a few, but over all the kingdoms of
                        this earth, and that He must reign till He has put all enemies under His
                        feet. This faith inspires him to endure hardship and to suffer loss, to hold
                        on. He never thinks of turning his back to the foe, or shirking the cross,
                        or turning the stones into bread, or of trying to shorten the march. He
                        never thinks of withdrawing from the thick of the fight, but goes on through
                        perils by land, by sea, by his own countrymen, but the heathen, by false
                        brethren at home and abroad. He looks onward through the dark clouds to the
                        proud moment when the King will say, âWell done, good and faithful servant!â
                        He listens, and above the din of the earthly conflict he hears the words,
                        âBe thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life!â</p>

                <div type="section">
                    <head>The Sham Judgment.</head>
                    <p><hi>MANY</hi> people dislike the very sound of the word judgment. They have
                        abandoned, as far as they can, any belief in a judgment to come, and they
                        ignore as uncharitable and severe any expression of judgment as to the
                        doings and characters of individuals in the present; but somehow the
                        instincts of humanity are too strong for them, and these very people find
                        themselves, in spite of their theories, pronouncing judgment both on
                        themselves and others every day of their lives.</p>
                    <p>God has reared a judgment seat in every manâs conscience, which in some
                        slight measure answers to, and prefigures the sentence which He declares He
                        will pronounce in every manâs action, whether it be good or bad.</p>
                    <p>Then if there be a great Judge of all, and a standard of right and wrong
                        which He has set up, it must be of supreme importance that we should
                        correctly understand what this standard is, and that we should judge of the
                        conduct of ourselves and of those around us according to it. Surely nothing
                        could be more deceptive and soulâruining than to accept as correct any<pb n="122" xml:id="VAB7129-117"></pb> short of the one unalterable and eternal
                        standard of righteousness and truth which He has laid down; and yet, alas!
                        popular Christianity distinguishes itself by nothing more than by a
                        systematic misrepresentation of right and wrong, calling evil good and good
                        evil. Just as in the days of Christ the spirit and essence of the law of God
                        was set aside and made of no effect by traditional interpretations of the
                        letter, so in our time interpretations and expositions, in direct antagonism
                        to the plainest words of Christ, are palmed upon the world by many of the
                        official representatives of Christianity, who back up their false tenets by
                        quotations from âthe word,â separated from their explanatory connections,
                        and made to sanction views and practices the very opposite to the mind and
                        intention of their Divine Author.</p>
                    <p>In pointing out as plainly as I am able a few of these misrepresentations, I
                        know only too well I shall lay myself open to criticism, and that I may even
                        run the risk of wounding some hearts that I would fain cheer. But the vital
                        importance of the subject will not permit me to pass it over lightly.</p>
                    <p>First: âJudge not that ye be not judgedâ is one of the favorite texts of
                        popular Christianity, which is interpreted to mean that we are on no account
                        to form an opinion of the rightness or wrongness of anybodyâs conduct. Under
                        the specious guise of charity, faith and unbelief, obedience to God and
                        disobedience, sin and holiness, are to be confounded in one indiscriminate
                        hodgeâpodge, and their actors and abettors treated exactly alike, making no
                        separation between the precious and the vile.</p>
                    <p>This spurious charity is pushed to such an extent<pb n="123" xml:id="VAB7129-118"></pb> that even the man who has pledged himself to
                        preach certain doctrines, and who is actually employed as the agent of a
                        Church for so doing, is not to be condemned if his âriper judgmentâ should
                        lead him to renounce those doctrines; while at the same time he holds fast
                        the salary and position with which he was entrusted in view of his original
                        engagement.</p>
                    <p>On the same principle we are asked to allow that people who never go to a
                        place of worship or bow their knees in prayer may be as good and faithful
                        servants of God as any others. We are told that perhaps they are carrying
                        out âthe Divine will in a spirit of true devotion to duty,â that working is
                        praying, and that a manâs belief bounds his responsibility, and so
                        forth.</p>
                    <p>âWe are all aiming at the same thingâ is a favourite way of expressing this
                        popular Christianity, which just suits the ideas of drunkards, adulterers,
                        and liars, as well as of shallow professors.</p>
                    <p>To declare positively that people are sinners, condemned already, and on
                        their way to hell, is accounted as âuncharitable judging,â âreally
                        dreadful,â and no one, we are told, can possibly be justified in coming to
                        such a conclusion.</p>
                    <p>All this we could understand perfectly, coming from the camps of infidelity
                        or from the haunts of vice; but to find it passed off in connection with the
                        name and teachings of Jesus Christ is monstrous indeed. What a sham to
                        worship Him who declares Himself to be <emph rend="sc">THE</emph> Way, the
                        Truth, and the Life, if there be no certain way, no definable difference
                        between the true and the false, no practical separation between the Christ
                        life and the life without Christ! Surely it is<pb n="124" xml:id="VAB7129-119"></pb> high time for all who care about the reign of
                        Christ on the earth to make up their minds to one thing or the other. If
                        Christ be our Master, let us learn His lessons, and abide by His rule, and
                        obey His commands. If, on the other hand, some are unwilling to see any
                        difference between the narrow and the broad road, between those who are in
                        the kingdom of God or out of it, who are with Christ or against Him, let
                        them be honest enough to declare openly that they have no Christ and will
                        have no prophet by âSociety.â</p>
                    <p>Another text which might be taken as setting forth a very favourite theory of
                        modern Christianity is that in which Paul personified the struggles of a
                        convicted but unsaved soul: âFor the good that I would I do not: but the
                        evil which I would not, that I do.â We are all to look upon ourselves as
                        âpoor, incapable, fallible creatures,â and this assumed humility is to
                        absolve us from all condemnation, on account either of doing evil or
                        neglecting to do good. Instead of condemning ourselves and others, when
                        convicted of some flagrant wrong or manifest inconsistency, we are to look
                        upon it as only what might have been expected. How often have I heard people
                        say, with regard to some man holding an official position in the Church,
                        âWell, he does not do this, that, or the other (whatever may be the duty in
                        question) as he might; but, you know, he canât do everything.â Such an
                        apology as this would be beautiful in the extreme, applied to those who are
                        known to be earnestly and faithfully striving to do their share for the
                        extension of the kingdom of God; but when applied, as I have generally heard
                        it, to what every one knows to be a systematic and inexcusable<pb n="125" xml:id="VAB7129-120"></pb> neglect of everyday duty, it is no more nor less
                        than a wholesale cloaking of sin. But, friends, whatever you do, never allow
                        your minds for a moment to trifle with questions of duty, for nothing can be
                        more fatal to either body or soul than to give way to the theory that one
                        really cannot be expected to do what one ought.</p>
                    <p>How differently people treat this question of doing their duty in commercial
                        matters. Imagine that business man who cannot attend to <emph>all</emph> his
                        customers, or who thinks it unnecessary to keep his place of business open
                        all the week and <emph>every</emph> week. What would you think of a servant
                        who should consider it unreasonable to get up at the proper time
                            <emph>every</emph> morning, or carry out your wishes in matters in which
                        her views differed from yours? How long could society hang together if this
                        looseness of thought as to what we ought and ought not to do were permitted
                        to enter into the sphere of every day life? But alas, alas! how much more
                        ruinous is this looseness when it relates to our great spiritual duties
                        towards God and our fellowâcreatures. Either you ought or you ought not
                        always to pray and not to faintâto learn and to do the will of God, to care
                        for perishing souls, to warn, counsel, and help those around you; and what
                        applies to you applies to all who take upon them the name of Christ in any
                        way whatever. We should never, on any account, allow ourselves to excuse any
                        neglect of God and duty, because such neglect is all but universal, but we
                        should look at things as they are, and in the light of the judgment throne;
                        and when we see conduct worthy of condemnation, condemn it, and be
                        determined to separate ourselves in heart and life from evil<pb n="126" xml:id="VAB7129-121"></pb> practices, however much respected they may be,
                        and to take our stand on the side of duty and of God at all costs.</p>
                    <p>I tell you honestly that I have turned away numberless times of late years,
                        and with almost despairing disgust, from audiences of what would be called
                        intelligent Christians, that is to say, persons who talk and act upon an
                        intelligent view of any imaginable subject, except that of Christian duty.
                        How often do I hear the remark, âWe know things are not as they should be,â
                        from people who have not the slightest intention of striving in any way to
                        make things better, and who would not, on any account, incur the odium of
                        expressing any condemnation of that neglect of religious duty which they
                        profess so much to deplore. Away with this unmanly, unwomanly cowardice. We
                        have the light; let us come to it in order to see whether our deeds, and the
                        deeds of those around us who profess to be âworking for God,â are wrought in
                        Him. We can, by Godâs grace, do our duty, if we will. As we tried to show in
                        a former lecture, Christ came on purpose to empower us to do it; but let
                        those who will not have such a doctrine and such a Christ, but who prefer to
                        accept the miserable theories of impotency, which would not be tolerated for
                        a moment in the kitchen, the shop, or the exchange,âlet them at least save
                        Christ from the indignity of having such helpless, incapable creatures
                        called by His name, and professing to be His followers. He says with respect
                        to all such, âWhy call ye <emph>Me</emph>, Lord, Lord, and do not the things
                        that I say?â</p>
                    <p>â<emph>But the Lord looks at the heart</emph>,â is another of the pet
                        doctrines of popular Christianity.</p>
                    <pb n="127" xml:id="VAB7129-122"></pb>
                    <p>True, terribly true in the right sense,âfor God is not to be mocked with lip
                        service or the formality of worship in which the heart has no share,âbut
                        false, ruinously false, when it means, as it generally does, that all sorts
                        of wrong may be passed over and excused, if people only say they mean to do
                        right.</p>
                    <p>I rejoice beyond all expression in the precious thought of the Lordâs long
                        suffering and tender mercy towards those who sit in darkness; and if we were
                        living in the centre of Africa, where people have been trained only to fear
                        and worship some hideous imaginary power of evil,âif we had absolutely no
                        spirit of truth, and no word of light to hear of to read, no knowledge of
                        God or a Saviour,âit might be admissible to consider everybody right who
                        meant right; but even those in this country who are most sceptical as to
                        Divine revelation cannot pretend to be in any such position as this, much
                        less people who profess to call themselves Christians. Is there anybody here
                        taking refuge in this hollow subterfuge? Friend, let me ask you, did you
                        really worship and serve God last Sunday? Had you any convictions as to what
                        He wished you to do, not only on that day but throughout the following week?
                        If so, have you acted on them, have you honestly tried to carry them out? If
                        not, do not, I beseech you, try to pacify your conscience with any silly
                        nonsense about the Lord looking at the heart. He has plainly told us over
                        and over again in the New Testament, and in the very last book of it, that
                        He will judge every man according to <emph>his works</emph>, and, moreover,
                        He has laid down the same rule of judgment for us. âBy their fruits ye shall
                        know them.â âLittle children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth<pb n="128" xml:id="VAB7129-123"></pb> righteousness is righteous.â I fear there
                        are thousands of professed Christians excusing themselves from the
                        performance of the most manifest duty by this excuse; for instance, when a
                        prayer meeting is announced, there are a certain number of people who make
                        an effort to be present, but a much larger number of soâcalled Christians
                        who deliberately choose to keep away. It is quite allowable to apply the
                        doctrine of the Lordâs looking at the heart to the poor mother who would
                        fain be there, were she not detained by the inexorable claims of half a
                        dozen little children; but to cloak over with the same excuse, the constant
                        indifference, nay, positive irreligion, in the great majority, is only to
                        refuse to come to the light because it would condemn you. People who mean
                        well, where there is no physical impossibility in the way, <emph>do
                            well</emph>; but those who fail to do well, will fare ill when the great
                        reckoning day comes.</p>
                    <p>Further, I charge it upon popular Christianity, even when it does pay some
                        tribute to the truth with regard to character, by recognising here and there
                        what it calls an âexcellent man,â or a ânoble woman,â that when you come to
                        examine into the meaning of these phrases, they are, in many instances,
                        utterly misleading. Most generally the persons thus eulogised are
                        distinguished, rather than for lack of those peculiar characteristics set
                        forth by Christ and His apostles as of supreme importance, than by the
                        possession of them. Just try to call up a person so distinguished within
                        your own knowledge, and ask yourself how they have earned their title. To
                        begin with, do they excel in prayer, or are they in most cases persons who
                        were never known to pray in<pb n="129" xml:id="VAB7129-124"></pb> public, or, at
                        any rate, without being specially called upon to do so? Or, are they
                        renowned for praying by the bedsides of the sick, or even with their own
                        families in the privacy of their own homes? Do these persons excel in faith,
                        shown by their works in the way of bold, straightforward testimony for God,
                        or in daring, unpopular enterprises for the salvation of men? or are they
                        generally silent both in public and private, giving no personal testimony as
                        to their knowledge of Christ, and carefully abstaining from any outward
                        demonstration on His behalf, which would bring them into discredit with
                        their neighbors? Probably they do excel in what is called charity; but is
                        not this generally due to the fact that they are much richer than others,
                        and only out of their enormous abundance do they contribute occasionally
                        large sums for Christian or philanthropic objects. What a name may be
                        acquired in modern Christendom by the judicious use of a few hundred pounds
                        per year, without so much as speaking a kind word to a brother or sister in
                        need, or denying yourself a momentâs ease or a single luxury! It is not
                        notorious that in ninetyânine cases out of a hundred it is simply the
                        possession of a certain amount of wealth which gives a man or woman his or
                        her grade in religious as well as in civil society, and that people chosen
                        for and entrusted with leading positions in churches, are simply those who
                        have the best houses of their own? Byâandâby their splendid coffins will be
                        pompously deposited in the family vault, and you will be told that they
                        âmaintained an unblemished character for many years;â that is to say, they
                        neither got drunk, blasphemed, committed robbery,<pb n="130" xml:id="VAB7129-125"></pb> nor picked anybodyâs pocket. They lived in
                        society in such a style as made them welcome in the circles of
                        semiâworldliness everywhere. Their linen and their dresses were unblemished,
                        for they never turned aside, like their Divine Master, into any of the
                        soiling habitations of the poor and the wretched, nor mingled amongst such
                        mobs as continually jostled Him all the way through life. Their names were
                        always mentioned with honour, for they took care never to let them be used
                        in connection with any enterprise, even on behalf of Jesus Christ, which was
                        not considered âquite the thing.â</p>
                    <p>Do not misunderstand me. I am very far from wishing to pour contempt upon
                        such persons, for without them what would become of the churches and of
                        benevolent enterprises generally? I do not question that many of these
                        individuals have at one time or other been converted, and might have become
                        true saints, had they been faithfully dealt with; but alas! they have, to a
                        great extent, been made the victims of that sham judgment which now selects
                        them as its standardâbearers. Of many of them, I doubt not, it might be
                        written, were Jesus Christ again among us, and were they brought in contact
                        with Him, that He looked upon them and loved them, notwithstanding all their
                        worldliness and pride of position. But what I want to point out is, that
                        such persons are not distinguished by popular Christianity for the
                        peculiarly Christâlike traits in their characters, but for the possession
                        and use of a long purse. This exaltation of mere morality with money stamps
                        modern Christianity as an <emph>unjust judge</emph>, and it will be fatal to
                        your views of what Christ demands of you, if you<pb n="131" xml:id="VAB7129-126"></pb> accept its model men and women as the
                        representatives of Christian excellence.</p>
                    <p>Fifth: As I have before remarked, there has come over society of late quite a
                        fever of professed benevolence towards the poor; and yet, in connection with
                        this very pleasing awakening to the existence of millions of miserable
                        people, we have another striking illustration of the sham judgment of modern
                        Christendom. âThose wretched, filthy peopleâ are simply the poorer classes,
                        who are compelled by their poverty to herd together by families in small
                        rooms, surrounding perhaps a courtâyard full of oysterâshells and other
                        refuse, at which societyâand Christian society, tooâturns up its nose, and
                        declares that the people breathe an âatmosphere of moral pollution.â
                        Perfectly true; there is an atmosphere of moral pollution present in these
                        dark alleys and horrible dens, to which people are driven by thousands, that
                        others may have plenty of room in which to carry out their ideas of
                        civilisation; but to eyes that look at things in the light of God, I say
                        there is an atmosphere of moral pollution, not a wit less dangerous, and far
                        more blameworthy, in very different circles.</p>
                    <p>Is it not notorious that multitudes of people amongst what are called the
                        higher classes deliberately denude themselves of ordinary clothing, and then
                        go in a halfâdressed condition, with every addition of ornament that can be
                        conceived, to insure that they shall be noticed and admired, to large places
                        of public amusement? Is there not a growing disposition in Christian circles
                        to look upon it as perfectly harmless for Christian families, including
                        often those of ministers, to spend hours together, dressed in the way I
                            have<pb n="132" xml:id="VAB7129-127"></pb> described, at parties, balls, and
                        other entertainments, frequently given within the precinct of some
                        consecrated building, or in order to raise money for church purposes? Now, I
                        ask, how it come to pass that the poor are spoken of as herding together
                        without regard for decency, under the circumstances of necessity which I
                        have described; while the herding together of the rich and wellâtoâdo in
                        this voluntary indecency should be regraded with complacency and described
                        are refined and genteel? That such is the judgment of modern Christendom can
                        only be attributed to one factâthe power of the purse; and that the Churches
                        should in the main devote their attention to the wellâtoâdo classes, while
                        they regard the masses of the people as a kind of outside element, to be
                        operated upon by separate agencies, as a few missionaries and Bibleâwomen,
                        is, I contend, a crying scandal to the Saviourâs name. The judgment of Jesus
                        Christ led Him to spend most of His time herding with fishermen, with
                        publicans and sinners. Their language might often be very violent and bad,
                        and their home life simply scandalous; but the Son of God preferred to make
                        His bed in a fishingâboat, and to sit talking with that infamous woman of
                        Samaria, rather than to hobnob with the religious swelldom of Jerusalem, the
                        outside of whose cup and platter would have passed muster with modern
                        Christianity, whilst their lives were full of hypocrisy and
                        unrighteousness.</p>
                    <p>Sixth: âThe brutal tastes of the lower ordersâ is another pet phrase of
                        modern Christendom.</p>
                    <p>It represents the idea that for a poor man, who has to keep himself and his
                        family on a few shillings per week by hard labour, which takes away all
                            inclination<pb n="133" xml:id="VAB7129-128"></pb> towards study or more
                        exalted pursuits, it is a brutal taste to like to have a quart of fourpenny
                        beer as often as his scanty means will allow. It is a brutal taste to take
                        pleasure in seeing two men fight each other, with their fists inflicting in
                        the course of half an hour many hard knocks and bruises; and it is a still
                        ore brutal taste which leads men to train animals to fight each other, and
                        to take pleasure in seeing them do so. Now I perfectly concur in the
                        denunciation of all these evils, from which God is enabling the Salvation
                        Army to rescue multitudes of these poor, soâcalled âbrutal fellows;â but let
                        us turn the light of truth upon the Christian society which shrugs its
                        shoulders in horror at the mere description of these men who get drunk and
                        beat their wives; the Christian society whose refined taste leads it to have
                        as little intercourse as possible with these lower orders.</p>
                    <p>What sort of taste is it, which, in the presence of the existing state of
                        things among the poor, spends not fourpence but four shillings, and double
                        and treble that sum on a single bottle of wine for the jovial entertainment
                        of a few friends, and from twenty to forty pounds for a dinner to be
                        swallowed by a dozen or two of people? I maintain that no splendid
                        furniture, no wellâtrained and liveried servants, no costly pictures or
                        display of finery or jewels, can redeem such a scene, viewed in the light of
                        the teachings of Christ, from being worthy of being called âbrutal,â and all
                        the more brutal because it is delighted in by persons whose intelligence and
                        knowledge of the awful state of things in the world around them must make
                        them fully aware of the good that might be done with the money which they
                        thus lavish upon their lusts.</p>
                    <pb n="134" xml:id="VAB7129-129"></pb>
                    <p>Let me take you to another scene. Here is His Grace, the Duke of Rackrent,
                        and the Right Honourable Woman Seducer, FitzâShameless; and the gallant
                        Colonel Swearer, with half the aristocracy of a county, male and female,
                        mounted on horses worth hundreds of pounds each, and which have been bred
                        and trained at a cost of hundreds more, and what for? âThis splendid fieldâ
                        are waiting whilst a poor little timid animal is let loose from confinement
                        and permitted to fly in terror from its strange surroundings. Observe the
                        delight of all the gentlemen and noble ladies when a while pack of strong
                        dogs is let loose in pursuit, and then behold the noble chase! The regiment
                        of wellâmounted cavalry and the pack of hounds all charge at full gallop
                        after the poor frightened little creature. It will be a great disappointment
                        if by any means it should escape, or be killed within as short a time as an
                        hour. The sport will be excellent in proportion to the time during which the
                        poor thingâs agony is prolonged, and the number of miles it is able to run
                        in terror of its life. Brutality! I tell you, that in my judgment, at any
                        rate, you can find nothing in the vilest back slums, more utterly, more
                        deliberately, more savagely cruel that all that; and yet this is a
                        comparatively small thing. One of the greatest employments of every
                        Christian government and community is to train thousands of men, not to
                        fight with their fists only, in the way of inflicting a few passing sores,
                        but with weapons capable, it may be, of killing human beings at the rate of
                        so many per minute. It is quite a âscientific tasteâ to study how to destroy
                        a large vessel with several hundreds of men on board instantaneously. Talk
                        of brutality! Is there<pb n="135" xml:id="VAB7129-130"></pb> anything half as
                        brutal as this within the whole range of rowdyism? But against all this,
                        modern Christianity, which professed to believe the teaching of Him who
                        taught us not to resist evil, but to love our enemies, and to treat with the
                        utmost benevolence hostile nations, has nothing to say. All the devilish
                        animosity, hardâhearted cruelty, and harrowing consequences of modern
                        warfare, are not only sanctioned but held up as an indispensable necessity
                        of civilised life, and in times of war, patronized and prayed for in our
                        churches and chapels, with as much impudent assurance as though Jesus Christ
                        had taught, âBut I say unto you, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth,
                        and, return evil for evil, hate your enemies and pursue them with all the
                        diabolical appliances of destruction which the devil can enable you to
                        invent.â Alas, alas! is it not too patent for intelligent contradiction that
                        the most detestable and brutal think in the judgment of popular Christianity
                        is not brutality, cruelty, or injustice, but <emph>poverty and
                            vulgarity</emph>? With plenty of money you may pile up your life with
                        iniquities, and yet be blamed, if blamed at all, only in the mildest terms,
                        whereas one flagrant act of sin in a poor and illiterate person is enough to
                        stamp him, with the majority of Christians, as a creature from whom they
                        would rather keep at a distance. I had an amusing corroboration of this the
                        other day from one of my younger daughters who had been visiting a poor
                        criminal in one of our large prisons. She said to one of the officers in
                        attendance, âI suppose you do not often have rich people in here?â he
                        replied, âNo, miss, we very seldom get anybody but poor folks,â and on her
                        replying, âNo, I am afraid it is because<pb n="136" xml:id="VAB7129-131"></pb>
                        you do not look out so sharply for them,â he remarked to a fellow officer,
                        âSheâs all there.â</p>
                    <p>Seventh: Further, âthe criminal classesâ is another of the cant phrases of
                        modern Christianity, which thus brands every poor lad who steals, because he
                        is hungry, but stands, hat in hand, before the rich man whose trade is well
                        known to be a system of wholesale cheatery.</p>
                    <p>It is never convenient for ministers or responsible churchwardens or deacons
                        to ask how Mr. Moneyâmaker gets the golden sovereigns or crisp notes which
                        look so well in the collection. He may be the most âaccursed sweaterâ who
                        ever waxed fat on that murderous cheap needlework system, which is slowly
                        destroying the bodies and ruining the souls of thousands of poor women, both
                        in this and other âcivilisedâ countries. He may keep scores of employÃ©es
                        standing wearily sixteen hours per day behind the counter, across which they
                        dare not speak the truth, and on salaries so small that all hope of marriage
                        and home is denied to them. Or he may trade in some damning thing which robs
                        men of all that is good in this world and all hope for the next, such as
                        opium or intoxicating drinks; but if you were simple enough to suppose that
                        modern Christianity would object to him on account of any of these
                        things,âin fact, that you were alluding to such as he, in the phrase
                        âcriminal classes,ââhow respectable Christians would open their eyes, and,
                        in fact, suspect that you had recently made your escape from some lunatic
                        asylum, and ought to be hastened back there as soon as possible. If any one
                        should dare to case any reflections upon any of these Christian
                        moneyâmakers, the<pb n="137" xml:id="VAB7129-132"></pb> representatives of their
                        churches would say, âHush, hush, my dear sir, Mr. Soâandâso is the great man
                        at our place, you know; they would be glad enough of him at the church
                        opposite, but he likes our minister, and we mean to propose him as a deacon
                        at the next church meeting.â So the wholesale and successful thief is
                        glossed over and called by all manner of respectable names by the
                        representatives of a bastard Christianity. It is ready enough to cry, Stop,
                        thief, when some poor fellow who has been out of work for perhaps months,
                        gets desperate at the sight of children crying for bread, and makes a
                        bungling attempt at getting what is not his own in order to satisfy them; or
                        when it hears that such men, left helplessly to their own devices, take to
                        living together, and bringing up a generation of thieves, it cries out
                        vigorously against the criminals. Sure, it may suggest a mission to them,
                        and even set about it in a helpless patronising sort of way, wondering if
                        really it is of any use to try to help âsuch men,â as though they were of
                        different flesh and blood to themselves. Verily such Christianity
                            <emph>is</emph> of different blood from Him who preferred talking to a
                        thief in His own last moments, to holding conversation with any priest of
                        whiteâwashed temple worshipper standing around. The man who hung by His side
                        was a great ruffian, no doubt, but then he had been trained in that way; and
                        if we want the judgment of Jesus Christ on such a point, He would certainly
                        give it against the pet of modern Christianity, and in favour of this poor
                        rough. The man whom Jesus Christ consigned to a hopeless perdition was he
                        who made long prayers, and at the same time devoured widowsâ houses; or
                        whose barns were filled with<pb n="138" xml:id="VAB7129-133"></pb> plenty while
                        Lazarus lay covered with sores at his gates.</p>
                    <p>On no point does the sham judgment of popular Christianity appear more
                        startlingly in contrast with that of Jesus Christ, than on the everyâday
                        question of honesty. It knows that its rich tradesmen are so dishonest in
                        their modes of carrying on their business, that if some poor fellow comes
                        out of prison, determined to do right and earn his bread honestly, we know
                        scarcely any with whom we dare entrust him, and with whom he would not be
                        tempted to break his resolution, by being asked to tell business lies, or
                        perform business tricks, which to his âunchristianisedâ intelligence is only
                        another mode of thieving; but Christianity goes on, with virtuous breath
                        declaring that the poor and foundâout thieves are criminals, while the rich
                        and secret scoundrels are the valued supporters of her institutions.</p>
                    <p>Further: âDesecrating the Sabbathâ is another virtuousâsounding phrase, which
                        is accepted as the expression of a very reverential religion. So it should
                        be, bet here the sham judgment comes in again! What <emph>is</emph>
                        desecrating the Sabbath? Well, it is not dressing up on fabulously costly
                        clothes (sometimes unpaid for), as near in fabric, style, and fashion as can
                        be to those worn in the very vilest services of sin. It is not to lie in bed
                        consuming the early hours of the day, and then to flaunt in this array to
                        one short service, as an exhibition of self and respectability, spending the
                        remainder of the âsacred dayâ in an easy chair with the last new book. This
                        is Sabbath <emph>keeping</emph>, even though to carry it out comfortably,
                        servants may have to work over an elaborate<pb n="139" xml:id="VAB7129-134"></pb> dinner, or the turning out of a luxuriant equipage. Then what is
                        âdesecratingâ? Well, go and spend next Sunday evening in Mr. Easyâs mansion,
                        and he will show you. You will not have an unpleasant time, that is, if your
                        notions agree with his. He will give you a splendid meal, and then you will
                        be allowed to lounge on one of his soft couches, while your host tells you
                        spicy stories about the popular ministers of his denomination, or his
                        daughter will play to you some âsacredâ music on the piano or the harp. Fire
                        and lampâlight will gleam softly, and thick curtains shut out the night,
                        about which some one will occasionally remark that it is âawful
                        weather.â</p>
                    <p>Presently a harsh, discordant sound is heard, like shouting and singing with
                        some brass instrumental music all mixed up; and if you looked out you would
                        see a little handful of men and women, wet and mudâstained, nearly exhausted
                        in the struggle with rain and storm, and the half rough, half goodânatured
                        crowd, who have been allured out of yonder alley, and are now going,
                        swearing, pushing, rolling along, on a fashion of their own, to a little
                        room, or a low musicâhall, where these tambourine players and the rest do
                        congregate. Your host will jump up with an annoyed air, and exclaim with
                        great emphasis, âDesecrating the Sabbath, that is what I call it!â and he
                        will go on to expound his views until you understand that it is a Sabbath
                        breaking for those poor folks to have made a noise in the street, even
                        though they were only doing what David and Jesus Christ insisted was to be
                        doneâpraising God with a loud voice, and confessing Him before all men. For,
                        âBlessed be the name of the Lord!â or âGlory! halâ<pb n="140" xml:id="VAB7129-135"></pb> lelujah!â certainly had rung clearly out above
                        the din with almost tragic earnestness. You will learn that your hostâs son
                        and daughter have kept the Sabbath by singing in the church choir, although
                        you see them later on, the one reading a novel, the other strolling out of
                        the house with a cigar and a hint about returning with the latchâkey. Now I
                        charge it upon popular Christianity that its professors know all the
                        miserable desecration which lies under the while modern keeping of the day,
                        and yet have not courage to condemn, but keep their blame for some effort to
                        serve the Lord which they deem vulgar and distasteful. Modern Christendom
                        gives its judgment in favour of the hollow, conventional sacredness of the
                        performance of the dressedâup choir, whose very manner and countenance often
                        betray the irreligion and frivolity of their hearts, and which neither wins
                        the souls of sinners nor stirs the souls of saints; but reserves its
                        strongest censure for the unscientific, roughâandâready brass band, which
                        empties the publicâhouses and gets sinners saved by scores and hundreds.</p>
                    <p>Further: âThe Sanctuary,â according to modern Christian theories, is a âholy
                        place,â and yet a place where no one must speak of being now and actually
                        holy! In fact, it is a place where scarcely anybody except the minister may
                        say a word to, or for God; where such a scene as that recorded in 1 Cor.
                        xiv. 23â31 would be counted the highest fanaticism, and next door to
                        blasphemy. I have heard of a congregation being actually thrown into dismay
                        by the cry to God for mercy of some poor sinner who had been previously
                        convicted, and gone to that chapel in the hope of finding the way of
                        salvation; but he had<pb n="141" xml:id="VAB7129-136"></pb> a near escape of
                        being ejected by the beadle. Better everybody refrain their feet from going
                        to these modern sanctuaries, that have a crowd of rough, needy sinners
                        really wanting light and needing to be brought to repentance and salvation.
                        âKeep silence before me,â says modern Christian society, and not a word is
                        breathed to hurt its feelings. It is a literal fact that in these modern
                        sanctuaries any manifestation of the <emph rend="sc">LIVING GOD</emph> is
                        the last thing expected or desired. Imagine the scare and horror of
                        excitement and the intense surprise if He came, as He did once in an upper
                        room, with His baptism of fire, in the middle of one of these quiet and
                        soothing services next Sunday morning! There would be a quicker and more
                        precipitous exit of many of the professed worshippers than there was from
                        the temple when He drove them out with a scourge of small cords! The great
                        work nearest to <emph>His heart</emph>âthe gathering in of the poor, the
                        maimed, the halt, and the blind, or the victims of sin, debauchery, and
                        crime, the thieves and the harlotsâis the very last thing desired and
                        expected in these modern sanctuaries. That He should speak in what is called
                        His own âhouseâ is the last thing arranged for. Alas, alas! do not these
                        facts prove that these are the temples of Mammon, of respectability, or
                        miserable, hollow, Pharisaic profession, where all manner of ungodliness is
                        glossed over by what answers to the tithing of mint, anise, and cummin? and
                        yet Christianity baptises these temples with her name, and holds up to
                        ridicule and contempt the openâair ring, where poor, simple, but devout and
                        consecrated people, plead with God to speak, and try to make the world hear
                        His message.</p>
                    <pb n="142" xml:id="VAB7129-137"></pb>
                    <p>Further: âHe is much to be condemned!â</p>
                    <p>What for?</p>
                    <p>Never, as we have shown, because he is taking it too easy; never because he
                        is enjoying a thousand a year, and letting men go on in sin undisturbed;
                        never because he makes no straightforward, bold confession of Christ, or
                        takes not up the cross to follow Him; never because he does not deny himself
                        even the luxuries indulged by others in his âposition,â in order that he may
                        push on the interests of the kingdom of God in the world!! âBut
                            <emph>he</emph> is much to be condemnedâ who gets into trouble,âinto a
                        row, as it is politely termed,âfor Christâs sake. Modern Christians ask with
                        bated breath, âWhy ever should he have gone and stirred up the moral
                        cesspools all around him, filling the atmosphere with âmoral pollutionâ? How
                        could he be so quixotic and fanatical as to expect to make things better
                        where the bishops and clergy, and all the most influential food people of
                        the day, had long decided that it was a better left alone? We really cannot
                        pity him,â say these modern Christians, âif he is set upon and traduced and
                        persecuted by all the libertines and whoremongers of the age; we fear that
                        he is seeking notoriety, and posing to be a martyr!!â And thus this bastard
                        Christianity adds its bann to the curses of Godâs enemies on the man who has
                            <emph>not</emph> done well for himself, but who has dared to stand up
                        for the poor and helpless, for brokenâhearted mothers and fathers, and for
                        the innocent and infant victims of the devils of lust and villainy,
                        incarnate in the persons of rich debauchees. Modern Christianity has got rid
                        to a great extent of damnation, but it can damn right vigorously in its
                            own<pb n="143" xml:id="VAB7129-138"></pb> fashion all those who âgo to
                        extremes.â It can pour its halfâsneering contempt upon ignorant, blundering
                        fishermen or mechanics, but who, nevertheless, love God and souls, and
                        believe in heaven and hell, and who really exercise selfâdenial and take
                        trouble in order to serve God and save men. If such men go to prison to win
                        some point for God and liberty of conscience, these Christians say in their
                        drawingârooms, in their magazines and newspapers, âAh, they are trying to
                        become notorious! they are zealous of being thought martyrs!â And thus they
                        join hands, as of old, with those who stood around the cross and wagged
                        their heads, and said, âHe saved others, Himself He cannot saveâ; and they
                        can pronounce this judgment with such a pious, exâcathedrÃ¢ air that many
                        simple men accept it as really the judgment of Christâs body on earth,
                        instead of the hollow, sham verdict of modern Pharisees.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, let me repeat that if my words seem to condemn the great
                        majority of the representatives of Christianity around us, it is with
                        sincere grief that I admit it. Would to God there were few localities, few
                        churches, and few ministers to which my remarks could be applied! But if
                        there be not few but many, I cannot help it. I appeal to you whether I have
                        spoken more than the truth; and I speak it in love of it. I would gladly
                        forbear to speak out thus,âI have forborne for long, and have frequently
                        felt condemned in so doing, and it is only because I see the utter
                        hopelessness of any improvement, of any recurrence to the simplicity and
                        purity of the gospel, without an<pb n="144" xml:id="VAB7129-139"></pb> utter
                        abandonment of the false and hollow judgment of modern Christianity with
                        respect to the matters we have been reviewing, that I venture to speak thus.
                        I would fain hope that some of you may be induced to forsake every refuge of
                        lies which has been reared around you, and to abandon all the false
                        standards of faith and practice to which I have alluded, and open your
                        hearts and ears to listen to the voice that never changes, but which in all
                        ages alike tells men of a just judgment to come. We must all appear before
                        the judgmentâseat of Christ; and it will be no excuse for us there that we
                        were surrounded by false witnesses, sham lights, and an openly received
                        system of hypocrisy. God has shown us His beloved Moses, Daniels, Nehemiahs,
                        Jeremiahs, Pauls, Johns, and numberless other worthies, standing out
                        gloriously alone in the midst of a Pagan society, full of refined and
                        splendid iniquity, and standing out ever more Divine, when all around were
                        âweighed in the balances and found wanting.â You have but the old choice to
                        make; may God enable you to make it, and to stand out for God and
                        righteousness against all around you.</p>

                <div type="section">
                    <head>The Judgment of the Great White Throne.</head>
                    <p>As we remarked in the first part of this lecture, the innate convictions of
                        humanity are too strong for the successful annihilation of a dread of coming
                        judgment. It seems to have been the universal opinion of the wisest and best
                        of the human race that there <emph>ought</emph> to be a judgment. The
                        continual miscarriage of justice in this world, and the unequal distribution
                            of<pb n="145" xml:id="VAB7129-140"></pb> its goods and enjoyments; its false
                        standard of right and wrong; its unjust and sham judgments, to which we have
                        already alluded, have seemed to drive it in upon the reason of all
                        thoughtful beings that there must come a settling day.</p>
                    <p>The unavenged wrongs of multitudes of the poor and the oppressed; of millions
                        of slaves; of poor, helpless children; of tens of thousands of poor,
                        brokenâhearted girls,âmere children,âwho have been wrecked of virtue and
                        happiness through the vice of those double or treble their age, and who were
                        fully awake to the consequences of their conduct;âwrongs such as these, and
                        multitudes of others, all unjudged and unrequited in this world, seem to
                        demand some future retribution. The unpunished sins of multitudes who have
                        flourished in their lives and gone in triumph to their graves, who floated
                        to their positions of eminence, fame, and luxury through the tears and blood
                        of widows, orphans and others, downâtrodden by their greed and power, cry
                        from the ground, as did the blood of Abel, for avenging justice.</p>
                    <p>Methinks if we could face this guilty crowd and compel them to speak, they
                        would be obliged to say, âYes, during our lives we violated all law and
                        justice, won the applause of men and the pleasures and honours in which we
                        revelled by means of the sorrows and suffering of our fellows; but no strong
                        arm stayed our progress, no tongue denounced our villainies, no power
                        punished our crimes; we lived and fattened, and died with the approbation,
                        nay, applause, of men ringing in our ears; and after death we were praised
                        and flattered on tablets of marble, in newspapers and biographies, as though
                        we had been the excellent of<pb n="146" xml:id="VAB7129-141"></pb> the earth. We
                        know that we are of the devil; we expect and are waiting for the
                        judgment.â</p>
                    <p>Further, the commonâsense of humanity perceives that human lives are all
                        unfinished at the grave, and require some appendix, some explanation. If you
                        found a book with the story all unfinished,âthe villains and seducers all
                        unpunished, and the poor, downâtrodden slaves unavenged, the wronged and
                        helpless people undelivered,âyou would feel that there must be another
                        volume somewhere. So, when life breaks up, with almost all men there are so
                        many things and doings and feelings all unfinished, that you might write on
                        every graveâstone, âTo be continued in the next world.â It is as if the tree
                        were blighted at its bloom; as if the life were sapped at its source; as if
                        the flood were turned back as its tide.</p>
                    <p>But, as we have already noted, there is a judgment already begun here and
                        now. The same Divinity is at work in this world who will reign and operate
                        in the next, and He is working on precisely the same principles. The moral
                        government of this world is going on under the shadow, so to speak, of the
                        great white throne. The shadow of that tribunal is reflected on all the
                        tribunals and transactions of this earth.</p>
                    <p>Formerly, when the judges visited the provincial towns, there used to be a
                        sort of public entry. The legal civic dignitaries went forth to meet them
                        and march in procession with them into town, preceded by heralds with
                        trumpets, announcing the coming of judgment for the wrongâdoers of those
                        towns. So God has His heralds abroad in the world, proclaiming that He is
                        coming. These heralds are already gone forth; they are here toâday.</p>
                    <pb n="147" xml:id="VAB7129-142"></pb>
                    <p>There is a herald in every manâs heart, giving foretastes of what the
                        judgment will be, pointing out and convicting him of sin.</p>
                    <p>Every transgressor of the Divine law stands condemned before his own judgment
                        seat. Conscience pronounces sentence on him according to his works,
                        independently of all creeds and theories. A false gospel, under the auspices
                        of popular Christianity, essays to set at nought this judgment, and to tell
                        men that they are not to judge themselves according to their works, but
                        according to their beliefs. But Godâs herald in them remorselessly holds up
                        their sin, and points to coming retribution. Conscience asserts itself, and
                        the man who has sinned knows, feels that he must be judged.</p>
                    <p>Further, not only does conscience convict of sin, but to a certain extent
                            <emph>punishes</emph> sin, even here. What horrors men suffer from their
                        guilty consciences, in spite of all their infidel reasonings and hopes. How
                        many suicides will be found, like Judas, to have been driven to distraction
                        by the remorse and anguish of realized guilt. Is not the fact that such
                        suffering is the consequence of sin unquestionable evidence that so long as
                        the soul continues to live and remain guilty, it must continue to suffer? If
                        transgressors can find no comfort or deliverance from this tormenting sense
                        of guilt in this world, on what principle can it be argued that they will
                        find it in the next? If conscience is too strong for them here, what ground
                        is there for supporting that they will rise superior to it in the
                        future?</p>
                    <p>Secondly: God has a herald in society. We have wandered a long distance from
                        God in these days, I<pb n="148" xml:id="VAB7129-143"></pb> admit, and as
                        distance from the sun brings corresponding darkness and obliterates the
                        distinctions between natural objects, so distance from God brings spiritual
                        darkness and induces blindness to moral distinctions. Nevertheless, far as
                        society has for away from God, and rotten as it largely is, still it has the
                        herald trumpet blowing loudly enough to proclaim evil to <emph>be
                            evil</emph>, and, being evil, to be amenable to judgment. And although
                        many preachers of a false theology, under the patronage of popular
                        Christianity, combine to persuade men and themselves that they will escape
                        punishment, the very libertines, thieves, gamblers, and moral bankrupts of
                        all descriptions, pronounce their judgment to be false, saying, âHypocrites
                        all of you, we know we are of the devil; his works we do, and we expect to
                        go to hell.â</p>
                    <p>I have no doubt that the great secret of the success of the Salvation Army
                        with multitudes of the openly wicked and profane is that we go straight to
                        their consciences, attacking their sins, making no excuse or palliation, but
                        telling them as straight as Jesus Christ Himself told the sinners of His
                        day, that, except they repent, forsake their sins, and turn to God,
                        everlasting fire must be their portion. This gospel answers to the voice of
                        conscience within; they know it is true, because it matches their most
                        secret and powerful intuitions, whereas the popular gospel of this day, its
                        judgment included, is the laughingâstock of hell; it dare neither damn the
                        sinner nor sanctify the saint.</p>
                    <p>But we must now consider for a few minutes what the character of this
                        judgment is to be, which is proclaimed alike by conscience, reason, and
                        religion. And the <emph rend="sc">BIBLE</emph>, after all, is the great
                        authority. It<pb n="149" xml:id="VAB7129-144"></pb> meets us just where
                        conscience and reason fails us, and responds to and corroborates the
                        profoundest and most indestructible intuitions of humanity.</p>
                    <p>Here the Bible comes forward and proclaims the fact of a coming judgment in
                        the most emphatic and unmistakable language, and describes the principles on
                        which are to follow from it, with the utmost minuteness. I have avoided
                        quoting texts more than I could help in former lectures, mainly because the
                        number corroborative of each of my points would have been so overwhelming;
                        but I must necessarily quote three or four passages here, and shall take
                        them from the words of Jesus, Paul, Peter, Jude, and John, that in the mouth
                        of three or four witnesses this truth may be established.</p>
                    <p>âThe hour is coming, in which all that are in the graves shall hear the voice
                        of the Son of Man, and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the
                        resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of
                        damnationâ (John v. 28, 29).</p>
                    <p>âThe Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with His mighty angels, in
                        flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not
                        the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: who shall be punished with everlasting
                        destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of His powerâ
                        (2 Thess. i. 7â9).</p>
                    <p>âFor we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one
                        may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done,
                        whether it be good or badâ (2 Cor. v. 10).</p>
                    <p>âBut the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the<pb n="150" xml:id="VAB7129-145"></pb> night; in the which the heavens shall pass with a
                        great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also
                        and the works that are therein shall be burnt upâ (2 Peter iii. 10).</p>
                    <p>âAnd the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own
                        habitation, He hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the
                        judgment of the great dayâ (Jude 6).</p>
                    <p>âAnd I saw a great white throne, and Him that sat on it, from whose face the
                        earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them. And I
                        saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened:
                        and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were
                        judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to
                        their worksâ (Rev. xx. 11, 12).</p>
                    <p>I accept that authority. That answers to the voice of my conscience. That
                        satisfies the claims of my intellect. Here I perceive that God will avenge
                        the wrongs, not only of His own elect, but of the fatherless, the widow, and
                        the oppressed of all ages, and the cry of my soul for justice is met, my
                        sense of outraged righteousness is appeased, my conscience pronounces, âTrue
                        and righteous art Thou, O King of saints!â</p>
                    <p>But people say, and a great many Christian people say in this day, âA good
                        deal of the language in these and similar texts is figurative language.â
                        They do not like the doctrine; it is too definite, too particular, too
                        inclusive for them; and so they try to explain it away. But supposing that
                        some of the language were figurative,âwhat then? What do you gain by making
                        it out to be figurative? What are figures for? Surely no one will argue that
                        the judgment, as preâfigured in<pb n="151" xml:id="VAB7129-146"></pb> the words
                        of Jesus Christ and His apostles, will be less thorough, less scrutinising,
                        less terrible than the figures used to set it forth! Therefore it does not
                        matter whether these be figurative expressions or no, seeing that they are
                        calculated to convey the most awful and tremendous ideas of the judgment
                        which any figures could convey, which the wisdom of God could select.</p>
                    <p>Some of the objections which people bring against the literal fulfilment of
                        these passages seem to me to be very weak.</p>
                    <p>They say, âWhere could be the scene of such a judgment seat?â I answer, He
                        who created the universe can surely make a platform big enough on which to
                        judge the inhabitants of this little world. For aught we know, there may be
                        one already erected. There may be a world of judgment going on, where the
                        representatives of the Divine government are already at work, getting ready
                        for the final sentence. We do not know.</p>
                    <p>Again, they say, âLook at the time it would require.â But I say, He who has
                        had patience to watch the long procession of manâs iniquities through the
                        ages of time will perhaps have patience to judge men on account of them! And
                        as one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, be sure, sinner, He will
                        take the time to investigate your case; you will not be missed out.</p>
                    <p>Note that this judgment is to be <emph>universal</emph>.</p>
                    <p>These passages and numberless others declare that the dead, small and great,
                        shall stand before God, and that <emph>every</emph> knee shall bow before
                        Him, and <emph>every</emph> tongue confess to Him. If God in some way will
                        deal individually with every son and every daughter of Adam,<pb n="152" xml:id="VAB7129-147"></pb> what does it signify where or by what method He
                        does it, so that the end be secured? You and I will find our way from the
                        spot, wherever it may be, to heaven or to hell, according to the sentence.
                        Our destiny in the great eternity which follows will be settled by the
                            <emph>sentence</emph>, not the method by which it is arrived at. The
                        great matter to us is that âwe must <emph>all</emph> appear before the
                        judgment seat of Christ, that <emph>every one</emph> may receive the things
                        done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or
                        bad.â This is not the Old Testament. I have purposely confined my quotations
                        to the New; this is the revelation of the <emph>gospel of Jesus
                            Christ</emph>, by which Paul declares God will âjudge the secrets of
                        men.â</p>
                    <p>Not only will every man and woman be dealt with, but every character will be
                            <emph>demonstrated, made manifest</emph>.</p>
                    <p>There will be no whited sepulchre business there, no makeâbelieve sentimental
                        salvation, no false gospel, with its creeds and phrases, no ceremonial
                        salvation, but we shall all stand revealed as we are, black or white, good
                        or bad, washed or unwashed, pure or impure.</p>
                    <p>What nonsense it is for people to talk of going down to death with their
                        hearts full of iniquity,ââas a cage of unclean birdsâ as some of them are so
                        fond of quoting. If so, what effect will death have upon their moral nature?
                        What cleansing stream will be opened by the Angel of Death? If you are not
                        saved from sin before you come down to the Jordan of death, there is no
                        virtue in its waters to wash you. There is only one cleansing medium for
                            <emph rend="sc">SOULS</emph>, and that is the blood of the Lamb; and you
                        must get washed in <emph>life</emph>, if<pb n="153" xml:id="VAB7129-148"></pb>
                        you want to pass muster at death and at the judgment seat.</p>
                    <p>People say, âDo you think the sins of the saints are going to be dragged out
                        at the judgment seat?â No! not the sins of the saints, for they are cast
                        behind his back; but the saints themselves are going to be dragged out. One
                        great end of the judgment will be to decide <emph>who are the saints</emph>,
                        and to show to the universe that Jesus was equal to the work He had
                        undertaken, namely, to destroy in the hearts of His saints the works of the
                        devil, and that He was strong enough to hold them up against all the
                        temptations and allurements of sin, blameless unto that day; and now they
                        are to be revealed and held up, not as dark, hollow, evilâhearted,
                        hypocritical people, but as the saints of God, washed and saved and made
                        clean and white, which you know means holy, in the blood of the Lamb. He
                        will point all the devils in the universe to His saints; they will be His
                        boast and glory, and manifest victory over the devil. The question of
                        questions then will be, Are you a saint?</p>
                    <p>Further, every character is not only to be settled and demonstrated, but it
                        is to be <emph>judged according to its deserts</emph>ââaccording to that he
                            <emph>hath done</emph>.â</p>
                    <p>He that knew his Masterâs will and did it not, is to be beaten with many
                        stripes; while he who knew it not and did things worthy of stripes, is to be
                        beaten with few. âAnd thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt
                        be brought down to hell.â</p>
                    <p>We shall be judged according to our privileges, according to the light we
                        have received, and the obedience we have rendered to it, not only outwardly,
                        but inwardly; according to our rebellion or submisâ<pb n="154" xml:id="VAB7129-149"></pb> sion to God; according to our loyalty and
                        obedience to Him, in our hearts as well as in our lives.</p>
                    <p>I am afraid many, even of those who are saved, will suffer great loss in that
                        day. There will be a great deal of wood, hay, and stubble, instead of gold,
                        silver, and precious stones. Oh, let us wake up in time to redeem the few
                        remaining days of our lives. The past is irredeemable; it is gone, and its
                        losses must remain for ever. The harvest which we <emph>might</emph> have
                        gathered is lost, and God Himself cannot make up to us for <emph>that</emph>
                        loss. We may have many toâmorrows, but we shall never have over again a
                        yesterday. Oh! friends, you who love Him will have to stand before His
                        judgment seat to receive the things <emph>done</emph> in the body. What are
                        you doing? Are you visiting His sick or in prison? Are you ministering unto
                        Him when hungry or naked, in the persons of His poor? When He is cast out
                        and traduced in the persons of His persecuted ones, are showing your love to
                        Him by standing up for His character and doing what you can to defend Him?
                        Are you seeking after His lost sheep <emph>diligently</emph> until you find
                        them, which means, you know, going after them <emph>where they are</emph>,
                        however the thorns may prick your feet or the sun light on your head? Are
                        you <emph rend="sc">DOING</emph> these things? because, if not, donât expect
                        Him to say, âInasmuch as ye did it unto one of the least of these My
                        brethren, ye have done it unto Me.â</p>
                    <p>Can anybody imagine that Jesus Christ will pronounce a sort of figurative or
                        sentimental judgmentâthat He will say, âInasmuch as ye did this or thatâ to
                        those who never did anything of the kind? Such a proceeding would be very
                        unlike anything He ever<pb n="155" xml:id="VAB7129-150"></pb> did or said when
                        on earth, would it not? He was so true that He was called â<emph>the
                            Truth</emph>;â so intensely real and practical that no shadow of
                        unreality or sham could endure His gaze for a moment. Is it possible to
                        conceive that He will be any other when He comes to judgment? And yet how
                        many of His professed followers are presuming on a Judge all meekness,
                        mercy, and love, quite forgetting that in that day the reign of mercy will
                        be ended and the Lamb that was slain will appear as the Lion of the tribe of
                        Judah, the Judge of all the earth, who will still <emph>do right</emph>.</p>
                    <p>What are you doing, friend? As the stories come to me from Hackney Wick,
                        Seven Dials, St. Gilesâ, the Borough, and other parts where our people are
                        visiting and working continually,âstories of destitution, sickness, sorrow,
                        and suffering, no less than of sin and crime and shame,âI feel, what can I
                        do, what can I say that will arouse Godâs professed people to some concern
                        and care for these poor lost multitudes? Our people tell me they find people
                        who say âDonât talk to us about a God: we donât believe in such a Being.
                        Donât tell us about Christians: we want neither you nor your tracts, nor
                        your Biblesâaway with you. We donât believe in such Christians, who leave us
                        to die in want and misery like this.â Men and women nearly naked, children

                        all over this London, perhaps not two hundred yards from the very spot where
                        we are assembled this afternoon; and yet who cares for them, or visits them,

                        back on the ears of the soul with more awful forebodings that the echoes of
                        the Archangelâs trumpet itself! Sentimentalism will have no resurrection; it
                        will rot with the grave clothes! What doth it profit, my brethren, to say to
                        the hungry and naked, either physically or spiritually, Be ye warmed and
                        filled, if, notwithstanding, ye give them not either the temporal or the
                        spiritual bread? He will say, âInasmuch as ye did <emph>it not</emph>,

                    <p>Further, the verdict of that day will carry universal conviction.</p>
                    <p>Every being will feel that longâwaitedâfor justice has come at last. The song
                        which will burst forth from the lips of the saints, as they take their
                        places in<pb n="157" xml:id="VAB7129-152"></pb> the celestial city, will be,
                        âTrue and righteous art Thou, O King of saints;â and methinks the same
                        words, though not uttered by the lips, will be graven on the hearts of the
                        hosts of the lost as they sink to meet their doom, and the realization of
                        the justice of their sentence will make their hell. May no soul in this
                        assembly, nor any who may read these words, ever realize what this means.

                    <p><hi>IT</hi> is assumed all through this Book that every human being has a
                        deity. In fact, we are so made that we must have a God<choice>

                        notwithstanding, and that god is, âto whom he yields himself a servant to
                        obey.â Now God claims to be the Deity of the soul of every human being; but
                        Satan has supplanted God, and he has done it in many ways. He has assumed
                        many different forms in order to suit different classes and conditions of
                        men. For one class of person he finds one idol, for another class another.
                        But the principle laid down is, that whatever the outward form may be, that
                        which usurps in a manâs affections, life, and action, <emph>the place of
                            God</emph>, becomes his deity. He need not outwardly label it
                            <emph>idol</emph>, or bow his knees and worship it. The supremacy which
                        he gives to it in his affections and life is the point.</p>
                    <p>What an awful thought that in this soâcalled Christian England, tens of
                        thousands of people are as truly worshipping idols as are any of the

                    <p>I want this morning to confine myself more particularly to the gods of the
                        household. Professing Christians speak about giving up the vanities of the
                        world, and coming out from the world, when, alas! we need not go outside the
                        four walls of their own dwellings to find their god. I am afraid there are
                        quite as many people who go wrong with these inside idols as with the

                        having things, and the worldâs way of doing things. When we look abroad on
                        the great majority of men and women around us, we see that they are utterly
                        godless, selfish, and untrue, and yet the majority always fixes the fashion.
                        It is not the few true, real, Godâfearing, earnest men and women who want to
                        serve God and help humanity who fix the fashion; it is always the majority.
                        Consequently, you see fashion is always diametrically opposed to Godâs way
                        of having things, and Godâs way of doing things. Therefore, the votaries of
                        fashion cannot possibly be the servants of God! There is no getting away
                        from that conclusion.</p>
                    <p>Let us now inquire what is Godâs great <emph>end</emph> or purpose in His way
                        of doing things, and in the way that He has prescribed in which we are to
                        have and to do things. What is shown by the constitution of our bodies, by
                        the laws and ordinances of the heaven, and by the laws of nature, to be
                        Godâs end in everything? Utility! If you look at your eye, or study<pb n="163" xml:id="VAB7129-156"></pb> your ear or hands, or any other part of
                        your body, you cannot find a single fibre or nerve which is not of some use
                        in your animal economyânothing superfluous, nothing for waste or for the
                        mere sake of being there. A useful result is the end contemplated. Look at
                        the heavensâit is the same; there is not a single waste star. Look at the
                        animal creationâit is the same. Look at the vegetable creationâit is the
                        same. The very rocks exist not for themselves. The earth ministers to the
                        wants of man and beast. There is nothing created for mere show, no useless
                        part of creation. The aim of God in all His modes and works is the highest
                        food to all His creatures. Now let us inquire what is the <emph>end</emph>
                        of fashion. When we substitute the means for the end, we lose the great
                        result God has in store for us. This is true in everything, natural, mental,
                        and spiritual. Now, Godâs order is to have everything attuned to the highest
                        result, especially in the case of His highest creatureâman. He wants us to
                        use ever power and capacity He has given us for the highest endsâto serve
                        God and humanity! But fashion has turned Godâs order topsyâturvy, and set up
                        as its end, supposed Beauty! <emph>not</emph> that beauty which is an
                        accomplishment of utility; but fashion sets up beauty as the
                            <emph>end</emph>, and not the accompaniment. Fashion says, âThat is
                        elegant. That looks grand, so it shall be so.â So the great question comes
                        to be in dress, in equipage, in our modes of doing business, in our
                        furnishing arrangements, and in our institutions, What is the order of
                        fashion? Fashion sets the law, and everybody does what everybody else does;
                        and all who will not bow down to this idol<pb n="164" xml:id="VAB7129-157"></pb>
                        are called puritans, fanatics, straightâlaced, or by any other terms of
                        contempt most convenient. So hot is this furnace of contempt and scorn that
                        it is one of the highest tests of moral courage in man or woman to set
                        fashion at naught. It is one of the grandest things to teach your children
                        from their babyhood to say, âNo, I wonât do that because everybody else does
                        it. You must give me a better reason than the fashion for what I do.â</p>
                    <p>Fashion prescribes the form of dress for almost the whole world. Doctors may
                        talk, and advise, and warn against high heels, tight waists, and
                        insufficient clothing, and all the monstrous and ridiculous appendages to
                        dress which fashion from time to time prescribes. But it is fashion! that is
                        enough. Never mind if tightâlacing does squeeze my lungs and prevent me from
                        getting the necessary amount of air, thus inducing premature disease or
                        death; it is the fashion, and I must do it. Never mind if the highâheeled
                        shoes produce deformity of the spine and all manner of other injuries; it is
                        the fashion, and I must have them. I must dress myself in the most
                        ridiculous costumes which Parisian milliners can contrive, it is the
                        fashion; if the dress is too light, or does not half cover my body, never
                        mind; I shall wear it because it is the fashion.</p>
                    <p>So, in the furnishing of peopleâs houses, in a great many instances, it is
                        the same. I have been in many houses where it seems to me that almost all
                        utility and necessary comfort for health and work is lost sight of. It is
                        almost all show, so that you are afraid to use a table for fear you will
                        injure it. Oh, the money and time that are squandered, and the perpetual
                            strife<pb n="165" xml:id="VAB7129-158"></pb> that goes on to keep up this
                        show because everybody else does it.</p>
                    <p>In their very companionships fashion has decided what should be the ground
                        and the rule of selection, and so fashionable people have only the
                        companions that society has settled they <emph>are to have</emph>. They do
                        not look, as you would suppose rational beings would, for congenial society
                        in the way of congeniality of thought, and feeling, and intelligence, that
                        which gives vivacity and interest to communion with another. Oh, no! If a
                        person ever so attractive and clever, and competent to interest, or
                        instruct, or please them, happens to be a grade lower on the social scale,
                        fashion says, âThat person is not in your circle, he is out of your sphere;
                        you cannot associate with such a person.â So they deprive their intellects
                        and hearts of the greatest delight, because fashion has prescribed what kind
                        of people they should associate with, and if those people be ever so hollow
                        and empty, never mind; they must obey the behests of
                        <emph>fashion</emph>.</p>
                    <p>Fashion has also settled that it is not the thing for people in certain
                        positions and stations to go to such and such <emph>places</emph>, but that
                        it is right for them to go to others, and so they go wherever fashion
                        dictates. Fashion has even prescribed the way people shall move and the way
                        in which they shall speak, and has got them pretty much squozen down into
                        uniformity, so that all naturalness is lost and they are nearly all alike.
                        It is the same kind of movement they make and the same kind of platitudes
                        they utter, everywhere and in all circumstances. I hope there are not many
                        of this class here this morning; but if there are any, let me ask, How do
                        you like the pictureâthe repreâ<pb n="166" xml:id="VAB7129-159"></pb> sentation
                        of the claims of this Deity?âthat rational beings, intelligent creatures,
                        some of them capable of great and glorious things, should be thus fettered
                        and bound and squozen into one shape and reduced to nonentities and
                        puppets?</p>
                    <p>Do you envy the fate of the devotees of fashion? Will <emph>you</emph>
                        worship this god any longer? Thank God, He emancipated me twentyâfive years
                        ago, and I have been free ever since. If you are not yet emancipated, get
                        emancipated this morning.</p>
                    <p>Do not consider fashion when you are settling how you ought to order your
                        household, but plan for the highest good of your children and those around
                        you, and for your greatest usefulness in the world. Never mind fashion.</p>
                    <p>In this day when chaplains of prisons and reformatories tell us that <choice>
                            <corr>gaudy</corr>
                            <sic>guady</sic>
                        </choice>, flashy dressing leads as many young girls to destruction as
                        drink, it behoves every true woman to settle before God in her closet what
                        kind of dress she ought to wear, and to resolve to wear it in spite of
                        fashion. If all professedly Christian ladies would do this, what a salvation
                        this one reform alone would work in the world! You young people here resolve
                        that you will be original natural human beings, as God would have you;
                        resolve that you wonât be squozen into this mould, or into that, to please
                        anybodyâthat you will be an independent man or woman, educated and refined
                        by intercourse with God; but <emph>be yourself</emph>, and do not aim to be
                        anybody else. Set fashion at nought. If people would do this, what different
                        households they would have! What different children! What different friends!
                        What different results they would produce in the<pb n="167" xml:id="VAB7129-160"></pb> world, and how differently they would feel when
                        they were dying! Oh, what wasted lives! What beautiful forms, and beautiful
                        minds, and beautiful intellects are prostrated and ruined at the shrine of
                        the god of fashion! May God deliver us from this idol!</p>
                    <p>Another of the most prominent of household gods is that of easeâcomfort. In
                        may instances the highest interests of the children and servants, the good
                        of the bodies and souls of men, the serving and glory of God, are all made
                        subservient to this god of comfort.</p>
                    <p>Think for a moment what God requires of every human being. First, He requires
                        all men to be His people; and secondly, He requires of all His people that
                        they should be absolutely <emph rend="sc">HIS SERVANTS</emph>.</p>
                    <p>Now then, compare the duties of a servant with the idea of ease and comfort
                        being the prevailing notion of a manâs life, and you will see its absurdity.
                        What would you think of a servant, whose prevailing idea was to make her or
                        himself <emph>comfortable</emph>? Suppose such a one saying, âYes, I want
                        the situation, I should like the wages, but I want my comfort most. I do not
                        want to get up any earlier in the morning than the mistress or the master. I
                        am not going to do any hard or troublesome work. I donât see why I should. I
                        should like an easy chair to sit in, and certain hours of the day to myself.
                        I am not going to do this or the other that is disagreeable to me. I am
                        going to be <emph rend="sc">COMFORTABLE</emph>.â What would you think of
                        such a servant?</p>
                    <p>You smile; well, if we are true and real, we have given up the ownership of
                        ourselves. We have<pb n="168" xml:id="VAB7129-161"></pb> become literally the
                        slaves of the living God, to do His bidding, to work for His interests, to
                        look after His lost ones, to extend His kingdom, and to live for His glory!
                            <emph>This</emph> is what we <emph rend="sc">PROFESS</emph>. This is not
                        The Salvation Army theology only. This is in all Church creeds, more or
                        less. It was sworn over your baptismal font that you should renounce the
                        devil and all his works, that you should give up âthe worldâ and be a true
                        and real servant of the Most High God. And yet I am afraid many in this
                        congregation have taken good care never to serve God at the expense of their
                        own <emph>comfort</emph>! If you suggest any plan of usefulness, the first
                        thing that meets you in one form or another is, âOh, that would be hard
                        work; that would be a sacrifice; or, I should have to give up so many
                        evenings a week;<choice>
                            <corr>â</corr>
                            <sic></sic>
                        </choice> or sometimes, alas, âthat would interfere with my dinner
                        hour.â</p>
                    <p>These easeâloving Christians do not look at the object that has to be
                        accomplished for God; but how it will effect their own ease and comfort. âI
                        visit the poor! Oh, I could not; think of the smells I should have to
                        encounter; look at the disagreeable sights I should have to see! My delicate
                        nerves would not bear it. Oh, no, I could not. If the Lord has any nice
                        comfortable work, I have no objection; but my comfort must first be
                        considered. Your mission services are all very good, but we cannot have our
                        household duties upset. We must have our domestic regularityâour comfort.â I
                        have wept many a times as I have parted with such people, when these words
                        forced themselves upon me: âSaul returned into his own house, but David gat
                        him into the hold.â</p>
                    <p>David must go and fight and face the perils of the<pb n="169" xml:id="VAB7129-162"></pb> wilderness, and endure all sorts of
                        selfâsacrifice, and conflict, and sorrow, but Saul goes back to his own
                        house. He has done with it. He thinks his responsibility is at an end. When
                        the meeting is over, these people who have heard all about the claims of God
                        and the lost, and perhaps said a few sleepy words of sympathy, or given a
                        fiveâpound note, away they go to their own houses; but the real Davids must
                        get up into the holds, or else Godâs armies will be wasted, and hell will be
                        more largely people that it would be otherwise. Somebody must hold the fort,
                        somebody must fight, somebody must suffer. Nothing can be done for humanity
                        but through suffering, and if one wonât, there falls a double weight upon
                        another. Oh, the multitudes of souls who have made shipwreck through this
                        god of ease! It ruins the soul that worships, as well as hinders all the
                        good that might be done for others. It has a stupefying, paralysing, damning
                        influence upon every soul that once gives way to it.</p>
                    <p>Once get under the domination of <emph rend="sc">THAT GOD</emph>, and you are
                        done for. If you are under his domination, for Christâs sake get up this
                        morning and ask Him to snap the fetters that bind you. Jesus from the Cross
                        cries to you. Suffering humanity is sinking at this hour by thousands into a
                        hell on earth, and a nethermost hell hereafter. Up, Christians, arise and be
                        doing! Put off your sleepiness, your idleness, and set to work; bend
                            <emph>your</emph> back to the burden, stoop to pick up the lost. They
                        are crying all around you for help.</p>
                    <p>If I understand this book, you will be called to an awful account if your

                        capacities for blessing your fellowâmen are all buried and destroyed by this
                        love of ease.</p>
                    <p>Thank God, He emancipated me from that years ago. I have had the same
                        temptations that others have had, and perhaps sometimes even extra
                        temptations, through excessive weariness, frequently hardly knowing how to
                        get from my bed; but I have had such a horror of getting under the dominion
                        of this god of ease that I have set my whole nature against it.</p>
                    <p>What would you think of a mother whose child was dangerously sick saying,
                        âReally, I am so burdened with the rest of my family, I have so much to
                        think about, that I cannot give myself up to this child. I am very sorry, of
                        course, I feel it very deeply, but I cannot deny myself of the comforts of
                        life. I must lie on the sofa so long, and I must do this, that, or the
                        other, or go here and there?â What would you think of such a woman? And yet
                        there are thousands of professing Christians who lie on the sofa, I am
                        afraid, half their time. They donât know what to do with themselves, trying
                        to get amused and occupied, and yet they profess to be God Almightyâs <emph rend="sc">SERVANTS</emph>!</p>
                    <p>My friends, put this practical test to yourselves. It is of no use going to
                        services and hearing beautiful sermons which you donât apply to yourselves.
                        Are not these things realities? If so, I say, for Christâs sake, for your
                        soulâs sake, and humanityâs sake, act accordingly.</p>
                    <p>Another household godâalas! I wish it could be kept out of the household (for
                        it is more especially the god of the world outside, yet it comes into the
                        family and gets into the hearts of the very little ones)â</p>

                    <head>The God of Gain.</head>
                    <p>Now Godâs order is for every man to look after his fellow manââlook not every
                        man on his own things, but also on the things of others,â but the worldâs
                        orderâits received maxim isââevery man for himself.â Godâs order is, âAs ye
                        would men should do to you, do ye even so to them.â That means, you know,
                        when you are making a bargain, donât run a man down below the lawful price
                        of his goods, any more than you would like him to run you down. Donât beat
                        down that poor woman in her work because you know she has no one to appeal
                        to. That is the spirit of selfishness, which is of the devil.</p>
                    <p>This god of gain, how I see its sway sometimes in houses where I stay. What a
                        contrast I often see between the interest excited by the news of the day,
                        and any information respecting the kingdom of God. You know how morning
                        prayers are got over very oftenâhow superficial it all is, how little heart
                        there is in it. It seems quite a relief to the worshippers when it is over;
                        then begins the real interest of the day. The gentleman seizes the
                        newspaper, looks up and down the columns to see how the funds stand. If you
                        keep looking at him you will tell in a minute if there is anything in the
                        paper that touches him. If he is a merchant, the state of the market as to
                        the things he buys or sells touches him to the quick; if he sees something
                        affecting his interests he will perhaps tell it to the wife, and then you
                        will see the older children looking towards him with the greatest
                        anxietyâthe god of gain has his hand even on their young hearts. They may
                        have some outward show of<pb n="172" xml:id="VAB7129-165"></pb> being religious,
                        but gain is the real god. If there is anything that entails immediate action
                        in connection with the business, you see how everything else is at once put
                        on one side. Then the lady says, âbusiness must be attended to.â
                            <emph>Must</emph> is a <foreign xml:lang="lat">sine qua non</foreign> in
                        the matter. Would to God they would put a <emph>must</emph> in somewhere
                        else. The children all know the importance of that must. They know, perhaps,
                        that they have money, that they are to be rich some day, but nevertheless
                        they want more. Their father cannot afford to lose if he has ever so much.
                        Gain, gainâthey must make gain! That man may see in another column of the
                        paper something which affects the work of God, but he only says a few sleepy
                        words about it, âvery sorry, very sorry indeed.â Then down goes the paper,
                        and he gets ready to go to his office. The column touching his gains touched
                        him to the quick, the other only touched his sentimentality; the one touched
                            <emph>his</emph> interests, the other touched only those of Jesus
                        Christ.</p>
                    <p>Once I was at a conference, and I shall never forget it. I saw a company of
                        ministers deliberating on certain questions, and the questions were all on
                        paper, so that everybody knew what was coming on. I noticed that when
                        anything came up affecting the character, or position, or income of those
                        individuals, every man was in his place, every man had his papers and
                        pencil, quick as lightning, to catch every word that was said. But when it
                        was a question that only referred to the work of God, to the interests of
                        the Church, to the salvation of souls, a number of them were out of their
                        places altogether. Others had got the newspapers, others were writing
                            letters.<pb n="173" xml:id="VAB7129-166"></pb> There was only a handful who
                        were paying proper attention to the question. I thought, O my God, it is as
                        it was in the days of old, âthere is not one of them that will keep Thy
                        doors for nought; they are all gone after their covetousness.â Donât call
                        that censorious. You know how true it is. I <emph rend="sc">WISH IT WERE
                            NOT</emph>. I feel as if I could give the blood out of my very heart
                        that it might not be so, <emph>but it is so</emph>. I have no doubt the
                        Apostle was forced much against his will to say and feelââFor all seek their
                        own, not the things which are Jesus Christâs.â Alas! it had begun to be true
                        then; how much more true is it now? I trust and believe that God is raising
                        up a people who will seek His, in their very heartsâ core, and who will be
                        willing to sacrifice their own gain!</p>
                    <p>âThe love of money is the root of all evil.â Human experience justifies the
                        Divine word. Show me a man who loves money for its own sake, for the sake of
                        hoarding it and leaving it to his children, and I will show you a man whom
                        the <emph rend="sc">THE DEVIL IS SURE OF</emph>. There is no doubt about it,
                        unless God in His omnipotent mercy awakens him and gives him grace to turn
                        that devil of avarice out of his soulââCovetousness, which is idolatryââidol
                        worship! gold worship! wealth worship!!</p>
                    <p>Are you worshipping this god? My friend, make haste for your life. You can no
                        more be the Lordâs servant and worship wealth, than the Jews were who
                        crucified the Lord Jesus.</p>
                    <p>Friends, go to your closets; see whether you are in any measure under the
                        domination of this idol of gain! see why you value your money; see what you
                        purpose to do with it; reckon, if you had a husband, a wife, or<pb n="174" xml:id="VAB7129-167"></pb> child in slavery, and you could buy them out, how
                        much of the money you would keep. Reckon what you ought to keep while
                        thousands of your brethren are the slaves of sin and the devil, when your
                        money would help to deliver them. Reckon this matter as you would reckon
                        with your steward.</p>
                    <p>You give your steward possession of certain property to manage for you; you
                        know that he must eat and drink, and have a place to rest in; if he is a
                        good servant, you say, âHere, John, I want you to accomplish that work for
                        me in so many months, and I place at your disposal these resources. Get in
                        these debts, see these creditors, receive such and such moneys, do such and
                        such things. You may take out all that is necessary to keep you in comfort
                        and in health (and if he has a family), as much as your family requires, not
                        for extravagance, but for your necessary comfort, while you are doing my
                        business.â Would you reckon that such a steward had a right to spend your
                        money in extravagant living, or hoard it up for his own personal ends? Are
                        you a steward of God? And do you expect to give an account to Him who shall
                        judge both quick and dead? If so, what will you say when He demands an
                        account of your stewardship?</p>
                    <p>The household god next in importance, and which is perhaps the most popular

                    <head>God of Education.</head>
                    <p>Everything must bow to the scholastic education of the children. Their very
                        health is sacrificed in hundreds of instances; the whole of the domestic
                            arrangeâ<pb n="175" xml:id="VAB7129-168"></pb> ments, the convenience of
                        father and mother and visitors must bow down to this god. The children must
                        be educated, whatever else becomes of them. I touched very briefly on this
                        subject in my address at Exeter Hall on âFamily Religion,â and some friends
                        seemed to infer that I was against education, whereas I have seldom talked
                        with any one on the subject more profoundly impressed with its importance! I
                        adopted, many years ago, the sentiment of the philosopher Locke, who said
                        that âin nine cases out of ten all the men we meet are what they are for
                        good or for evil, for usefulness or otherwise, by their education.â I say I
                        fully believe that, and have acted upon it in training my own family; so you
                        see my quarrel is not with education, but with a certain <emph>kind</emph>
                        of education.</p>
                    <p>I believe that a child ought to be educated every halfâhour of its lifeânever
                        ought to be left to itself in the sense of not having a recognised influence
                        exerted over its mind. The question is then, What <emph>kind</emph> of
                        education is the right kind to bestow upon children? How ought you to
                        educate them? The same idea which helped us on the question of fashion my
                        help us again here. What should be the great purpose of education? Surely
                        right education must be that which is calculated to help the child to attain
                        the <emph>highest type of its kind</emph>, and to fit it for its highest
                        destiny. You train your horse on that principle. You develop and strengthen
                        it that it may be a perfect creature, having capacity developed for the
                        highest service of which its nature is capable. I say that all right
                        training ought to contemplate this end, and especially with respect to man,
                        Godâs highest creature. Next comes the question, What <emph>is</emph> the
                        highest type of<pb n="176" xml:id="VAB7129-169"></pb> a man? and the highest
                        destiny of a man? What ought we to aim at? For if the aim is wrong, all our
                        training will be wrong. I say that the highest type of a man is that in
                        which the <emph>soul</emph> rules over the body, in which a purified,
                        ennobled soul rules through an enlightened intelligence, and makes every
                        faculty of the being subservient to the highest purpose, the service of
                        humanity and the service of God! If I understand it, that is the highest
                        type of man and his highest destiny. And it seems to me that all education
                        that falls short of this is a curse rather than a blessing.</p>
                    <p>The aim of all rightly directed education is to make such men and women, and
                        to fit them for such work, and if it fails of this, I say it is oneâsided,
                        unphilosophical, and irreligious, and <emph rend="sc">THAT IS MY QUARREL
                            WITH MODERN EDUCATION</emph>. I charge it with being all this, and that
                        is the reason I did not educate my children after its theories; I did not
                        believe in them, and the results so far prove that I was right.</p>
                    <p>Then first let me look at what ought to be the purpose of education. Most of
                        you, nearly all, I presume, agree as to what I have stated. But the purpose
                        of modern education is anything but this. It is for the most part planned
                        and executed with a view to the aggrandisement or wellâbeing of the
                        individual, looked at in a worldly point of view. Parents look at their boy
                        and say, âNow, what can we do with him?â They have all sorts of aspirations
                        and ambitions for the boy, and they say, âWell, we must educate him, develop
                        his intellectââwhat for? That he may use it for the service of humanity and
                        the glory of God? Oh no, that never enters their minds. They say,<pb n="177" xml:id="VAB7129-170"></pb> âWe will have him educated in order that he may
                        shine in the world, or get up in the world. We will have a son who will be
                        able to go to the bar, the senate house, or do anything else that their
                        ambition fixes on. The <emph rend="sc">AGGRANDISEMENT OF THE
                            INDIVIDUAL</emph> is the end, not the universal good, and out of this
                        wrong aim arises the undue estimate of mere scholastic education. What would
                        you say of the training of an animal, if it were possible for the trainer to
                        select one or two faculties, and develop and strengthen them to the
                        exclusion, neglect, or extinction of other faculties? Would you say that was
                        right training?</p>
                    <p>The main idea of modern education is that of the imparting of knowledge.
                        Knowledge is the idol which both the household and the nation toâday are
                        worshipping more largely perhaps than any other, as if progress in knowledge
                        constituted the true progress of man. Oh, if it were so, what a different
                        world we should have toâday; but we know it is quite the contrary. We know
                        that the more knowledge you give to an individual, without giving him a
                        corresponding disposition to use it for good, the more you increase his
                        capacity for mischief. Very often the most learned men live for the worst
                        purposes! But, alas! the very flower of the youth of our nation are
                        sacrificed to this modern deity. The notion is that our youth must be
                        educated in this mischievous sense; they must be crammed with knowledge;
                        whether it be a curse or a blessing to them is not the question, <emph>but
                            they must have it</emph>. They must learn the dead languages, and read
                        bad literature, in order to make them like the rest of the world around
                        them, no matter what becomes of their morals; they must be crammed with<pb n="178" xml:id="VAB7129-171"></pb> science,âmuch of it falsely so called;
                        much of it in embryo, crude and shallowâthe shallow theories of minds trying
                        to grasp profound thoughts, and getting lost in the fogs of their own folly,
                        landing the poor pupils on the strand of infidelity and atheism. The
                        intellect, the one faculty of the man, must be strained, and stretched, and
                        crammed to the utter neglect, and often destruction, of the moral faculties.
                        And when you have done, what have you produced? An enlightened animal, an
                        intellectual monster, who walks abroad, treading under his feet all the
                        tender instincts and most sacred feelings and aspirations of humanity. That
                        is all you have produced; there are thousands such to be seen toâday. Alas!
                        my heart bleeds over the stories I hear all over the land, which I could
                        give you as illustrations of this fact. All this mischief comes of upsetting
                        Godâs orderâcultivating the intellect at the expense of the
                            <emph>heart</emph>; being at more pains to make our youth
                            <emph>clever</emph> than to make them <emph rend="sc">GOOD</emph>!</p>
                    <p>This false theory leads to false methods, and hence the deplorable condition
                        of our nation toâday. It leads to the separating from home life our little
                        boys of ten and twelve years of age, and our little girls too, alas! sending
                        them away from the tender influences, and what ought to be the grand and
                        noble inspirations of their mothers, to herd with boys of their own age and
                        class, to have their moral nature manipulated by masters, often sceptical or
                        immoral. Now I say and will maintain that the chief end of education is not
                        mere teaching, but <emph rend="sc">INSPIRATION</emph>; and if you fail to
                        inspire your pupil with nobleness, disinterested goodness, truth, morality,
                        and religion, not only are all the<pb n="179" xml:id="VAB7129-172"></pb>
                        glorious ends of education lost, but you damn your pupil more deeply than he
                        might have been damned without your education. I ask, Is it not so? Take
                        some of your own sons (alas! I could point to numbers round about) as
                        illustrations of this fact. God has given every child a tutor in his mother,
                        and she is the best and only right tutor for the heart.</p>
                    <p>I defy you to fill a proper motherâs place for influence over the heart. If
                        God were to depute the angel Gabriel, he could not do it. God has tied the
                        child to its mother by such peculiar moral and mental links that no other
                        being could possibly possess. I tell you mothers here, that if you are good
                        mothers, you are committing the greatest wrong to send away your child from
                        your homes, and I believe this wretched practice is ruining half our nation
                        toâday. God committed the child to its parents to be educated, not to the
                        schoolmaster. You can employ the schoolmaster to teach his head,âand even
                        then you must be very careful of what sort he is, or he will ruin the child;
                        but God committed the child to the parents to be educated, trainedâthat is,
                        taught how to <emph>feel, think</emph>, and <emph>act</emph>. And it is to
                        the mother especially belongs the art and the capacity to inspire her boy to
                        love all that is noble and good, and disinterested, and grand in humanity,
                        and to keep on inspiring him until he is strong enough in Godâs likeness and
                        grace to walk alone. Just as you tend him when he is a baby, and will not
                        leave him to strangers, so, while he is a moral infant, you are to watch and
                        keep and train him until he is able to walk alone. I set my soul on this
                        with regard to my own children, and God<pb n="180" xml:id="VAB7129-173"></pb>
                        has enabled me to do it. I had a great fight over it in many ways, but I
                        said, âI am <emph>determined</emph> to keep my children for God and
                        goodness. They shall have the education that I think likely to help them to
                        be useful to their generation, as far as possible; but I will never
                        sacrifice purity to polish, I will never sacrifice the heart to the head.â
                        That was my resolve, and I see no cause to regret it.</p>
                    <p>I think it was Fenelon who said that âthe service of my family is more
                        important than the service of myself, and the service of my nation is more
                        important than the service of my family, and the service of my humanity is
                        more important than the service of my nation.â That is my opinion. This is
                        Godâs idea of manâs highest vocation: âThe Son of Man is come to seek and to
                        save that which was lost.â If Godâs type of manhood had been a being crammed
                        with knowledge to the exclusion of the moral and religious sentiments, Jesus
                        Christ would have been such a man, whereas He was the opposite. He combined
                        all the tenderness, sublime devotion, and selfâsacrifice of the woman with
                        the intellect and strength of a man. He was Godâs model man. That is the
                        type for us. Therefore, for the sake of your children and your own grey
                        hairs, I beseech you to see to it that you train and educate them in His
                        likeness. Alas! I know many parents in this land toâday, who are wringing
                        their hands in anguish for the consequences of a false notion of education,
                        and yet there are tens of thousands more who are making the same experiment,
                        to have the same results.</p>
                    <p>I was staying in a mansion some time ago, where there was everything that
                        wealth and refinement could<pb n="181" xml:id="VAB7129-174"></pb> procure to
                        make the parents happy. But I thought as I looked at the dear old
                        gentlemanâone of the kindly type of man, at whose table you like to sit down
                        because of the genial intercourse and the generous sympathies of his soul
                        towards all humanityâbut I thought there seemed to be a gloom over the
                        household. I felt as if he had a sorrowful spirit, though I knew not why.
                        After dinner, when we got into the library, he said, with trembling
                        lips,â</p>
                    <p>âI wish you could get a word with Eâ.â</p>
                    <p>I said, âWho is that?â</p>
                    <p>âMy eldest son; do try to get a minute to speak with him.â</p>
                    <p>âWhy, what is the matter?â I said.</p>
                    <p>âI am afraid he has embraced sceptical opinions, I sent him to a professedly
                        Christian school (ah, I thought, the old story!) and then to college, and
                        now I am afraid he is nearly an infidel.â</p>
                    <p>And when I got hold of the young gentleman I saw that he was just of the type
                        our modern schools produceâselfâconceited, proud, vain; a young man who
                        looked down on his father as much as an antiquated picture or piece of
                        furniture. Oh, these stories, they break my heart! I felt that this dear old
                        man spent his money on the education of his son, and thought he was doing
                        the best he could for him, to send him to a soâcalled Christian school and
                        then to a soâcalled Christian college, and here is the result; and there are
                        thousands of such results!</p>
                    <p>Yet people send their sons over and over again to these schools and colleges,
                        commit them knowingly to sceptical and infidel teachersâgive them over,
                        body, mind, and soul to them, to go through a process of<pb n="182" xml:id="VAB7129-175"></pb> education which necessitates the putting into
                        their hands of text books containing all matter of idolatrous legends and
                        impure and immoral histories, bringing into their imaginations all manner of
                        profanities and impurities just at the most critical period of their
                        history. And this is all done under the name of â<emph rend="sc">CHRISTIAN
                            EDUCATION</emph>!â</p>
                    <p>I could tell you stories that would make you weep almost tears of blood at
                        the consequences of these associations. Donât I know mothers toâday who are
                        wringing their hands in agony, and fathers who are bowed down almost to the
                        grave, brokenâhearted, because of them? Add to this education association
                        with troops of godless, lawless, and frequently immoral youths, whom they
                        are sure to have for their companions, and then wonder that youths isolated
                        from their mothers, sisters, and all the refining and religious influences
                        of home lifeâput into these schools and colleges, and kept there frequently
                        for seven or eight years, and I ask, Can parents be surprised that they
                        receive them back without any principles, without any love for their
                        parents, without any religion, and without any respect for humanity? to walk
                        about and trample under foot the most sacred instincts, and feelings, and
                        aspirations of true manhood and womanhood, and to march over the nation to
                        spread desolation and ruin wherever they goâmoral waifs and straysâdrifting
                        down the current of humanity, down, down to everlasting shame?</p>
                    <p>This is the result of modern education falsely so called. I challenge anybody
                        to disprove it. Now then I say, let ever Christian parent in his closet
                        settle before God this matter. What will you make<pb n="183" xml:id="VAB7129-176"></pb> your child? Will you say, âI will be more
                        concerned that he shall be a good, benevolent, holy man, working for the
                        good of his race, than that he shall be one of those intellectual monsters,
                        all head and no heart. <choice>
                            <corr>I</corr>
                            <sic></sic>
                        </choice> will rather that he should be poor and good than that he should be
                        rich and wickedâ? When you come to that, you will save your children. But
                        you say, âWell, I must have this position and that position for him, not
                        because of the use he will be to humanity and the glory he will bring to
                        God, but because he will be a bigger man, having social position and
                        influence.â Ah! thousands have said that, and their sons have ended in being
                        nobodysâidle, extravagant, spendâthrifts, taking all the patrimony of their
                        brothers and sisters to keep them going in their evil courses. Truly, âGod
                        is not mocked: whatsoever a man soweth, <choice>

                <head>THE SALVATION ARMY FOLLOWING CHRIST.</head>
                <head type="sub">BY COMMISSIONER RAILTON.</head>
                <p><hi>DURING</hi> the past twenty years there has been growing up in the midst of
                    Christendom an organization which has been all along denounced and opposed, in a
                    manner remarkably resembling the opposition shown to Christ and His apostles by
                    the religious and respectable people of their day. The very phrases applied to
                    the latter have been those most commonly used in connection with the Salvation
                    Army.</p>
                <p>Such expressions as âblasphemy,â âblasphemous performance,â âmockery of
                    religion,â have been repeatedly used by the most thoughtful and influential
                    critics with respect to this organization, and for what reason? Simply because
                    poor and unlettered men and women are found continually expressing an intimate
                    acquaintance with God in terms almost identical with those which are common in
                    the Psalms and the Gospels. The poor man cries, and the Lord hears and delivers
                    him; the convicted publican smites on his breast and crys, âGod be merciful to
                    me a sinner,â but the unbelieving onlooker denounce his crying as an
                    âintolerable noise,â and his declaration that he has been delivered, an
                    âunwarrantable presumption.â It is notorious that in thousands of buildings next
                    Sunday, congregations of people who, a few years ago,<pb n="188" xml:id="VAB7129-179"></pb> had nothing whatever to do with the worship of God,
                    will be repeating exactly suchâlike experiences. Yet even some of those who
                    regard these people with a somewhat friendly eye will excuse their making âa
                    joyful noise unto the Lordâ as a âpardonable extravagance,â and will explain
                    that it is due to their âwant of cultureâ that they do not worship God in the
                    âdecorous silenceâ which is customary in modern places of worship. As for the
                    greater part of the community, they will denounce the whole of the proceedings
                    as an âoutrageous nuisance,â âa farce,â etc., which âought to be put down,â or
                    got rid of, if it were possible, and which it is to be hoped âwill not last
                    long.â</p>
                <p>Now it is a remarkable fact, worthy of the most careful study by all who would
                    understand either the power of God or the times in which we live, that in the
                    face of all this hostile opposition this Army will go on without altering its
                    course in the slightest degree to gain public favour, and that in fact it has
                    gone on steadily increasing during twenty years, in spite of such
                    opposition.</p>
                <p>five years ago this Army had only 442 corps and 1,067 officersâpersons, that is
                    to say, employed in the work and supported by it. During the year 1882 no less
                    than 669 of the soldiers,â251 of them womenâwere knocked down, kicked, or
                    brutally assaulted in the streets; fiftyâsix of the 530 buildings used were
                    attacked and partially wrecked, and eightyâsix officers or soldiers, fifteen of
                    them women, were locked up and imprisoned by the authorities in connection with
                    the openâair services. Bishops, editors of religious papers, chairmen of great
                    religious assemâ<pb n="189" xml:id="VAB7129-180"></pb> blies united to denounce the
                    Army in the extremest terms; but at the end of five years it is found to consist
                    of 2,153 corps, under the leadership of more than 5,200 officers.</p>
                <p>Now, if it be correct that the Army systematises blasphemy, this prodigious
                    increase is truly a calamity; but if, on the contrary, it is found that
                    thousands whose every second sentence was formerly an oath, and who neither
                    feared God nor regarded man, are now to be seen clothed and in their right
                    minds, singing (though it may be in rough style) the praises of God and living
                    honest, industrious, and benevolent lives; then surely these figures eloquently
                    demonstrate that the truth lies entirely on the other side, and that this vast
                    workingâclass organizations is, after all, acting in conformity with the will of
                    God, and therefore blessed and helped by Him, involving the inevitable
                    conclusion that the common opinion of the day is in violent opposition to the
                    spirit and work of Jesus of Nazareth.</p>
                <p>Let us examine a little more closely the methods of the Armyâs increase, as
                    illustrated by one of its most recent advances. A couple of young girls,
                    formerly engaged in domestic service, declare themselves to be called to go out
                    and preach the Gospel. For this purpose they place themselves at the disposal of
                    the only religious organization in the world which thinks it right to give them
                    this opportunity, and after careful examination into their character, they are
                    sent off to a foreign country, where they are to raise an Army corps in a
                    certain small town. The building in which they are to gather in their
                    congregation is simply a longâdisused workshop, where a<pb n="190" xml:id="VAB7129-181"></pb> number of unbacked seats have been placed. There is
                    not a single person in the town who can be regarded as friendly to their
                    mission, and most people consider their appointment as directly opposed to the
                    will of Christ. Yet night after night their humble barracks are crowded with an
                    audience consisting mainly of persons who have never worshipped God before. The
                    meetings are interrupted, and violent scenes sometimes occur. Yet, as is common
                    all over the world, those two officers have raised a corps in a short time.</p>
                <p>And what is their corps? It consists of working men and women who are ready to
                    stand up in the meetings and add their testimony to that of their officers, that
                    Jesus Christ is a living Saviour. In the language of apostles and psalmists, not
                    quoted but reproduced almost in identical terms from their own experience, they
                    say that they were up to the time of their coming to these meetings âafar off by
                    sin and wicked words, but have now been brought nigh to God by the blood of the
                    Cross;â that He has filled their hearts with peace and gladness such as they
                    never found while in pursuit of worldly pleasure,âa peace and gladness which
                    rather increase than diminish under the scorn and opposition of family, friends,
                    and workmates. It is not long before some of these converts are found expressing
                    their highest ideal of duty in the desire to do exactly what their officers did
                    when they left home, situation, worldly comforts and prospects, and embarked on
                    a life of poverty and difficulty such as they have seen worked out before their
                    eyes, in order to spread the glad tidings of a real Saviour from sin, whom they
                    personally know.</p>
                <pb n="191" xml:id="VAB7129-182"></pb>
                <p>Every step in the Armyâs progress has been accomplished in some such way as this,
                    and the astonishment to most of us is not that such results should follow, but
                    that people of intelligence should either continue with their eyes closed to it
                    all, as though it had no existence, or else with persistence object, as though
                    the Army were violating in every way the will of God, Again I say, this drives
                    one inevitably to one of two conclusions,âeither the army must be a system of
                    the most terribly Godâdishonouring delusion,âa curse to the world of the most
                    awful kind, or else, if it be indeed what it professes to be, inspired, moved,
                    and directed by Himâthen the peoples of our day must have departed far from the
                    spirit and teaching of God, both by His prophets and His Son, to have come into
                    direct collision with these forces acting under His leadership.</p>
                <p>If we search still more deeply into the secret of the Armyâs life and activities
                    we shall find at every step the phenemon of a faith and practice exactly similar
                    to those which the language of psalmists and apostles, literally taken,
                    describe. Here are poor fishermen, who declare that they have heard Jesus Christ
                    calling them to leave all and follow Him. They say that He walks by their side
                    on the shore and sails with them over the stormy deep; that they commune with
                    Him in the night watches; that whereas, but a short time ago, they were so
                    utterly in darkness as to know nothing of the possibility of prayer, they now
                    see clearly those great spiritual truths which have sustained their comrades in
                    ages past; that God Himself is their light, and gives them to see, day by day,
                    amidst the most toilsome occupations and the most ruffianly surroundings,
                        more<pb n="192" xml:id="VAB7129-183"></pb> and more of Himself and His will
                    concerning them. Nobody pretends to question that the lives of multitudes of
                    such men have been, as the result of their connection with this Army,
                    transformed as completely as they themselves declare that their inward
                    experiences have been. Here are people who, but a few years ago, received with
                    blows and curses those who spoke to them in the name of Christ, but who now
                    manifest the same tender love towards those who illâtreat as was shown in the
                    first place towards themselvesâmen and women who gladly bear contempt, abuse,
                    poverty, and suffering of every kind, that they may spend the part of life which
                    still remains to them in proclaiming their Saviour; men and women whose want of
                    education and of many qualifications that one would suppose to be desirable for
                    such a work, cannot prevent from profoundly impressing the souls, and thus
                    changing the lives of multitudes of others. How is it all to be accounted for?
                    We must either accept their own account of the marvel, and conclude that it is
                    by the power of Jesus of Nazareth that these men see and walk thus in the
                    presence of us all, or else we must find some other way of accounting for the
                    change wrought in them.</p>
                <p>Attempts of this kind have indeed been made, but they do not commend themselves
                    to very serious attention. âExcitementâall excitement!â some have said. But has
                    religious excitement ever been known to last for years consecutively in
                    individual cases? Generally speaking, the duration of a wave of popular
                    excitement upon any subject is to be measured by weeks, or by months at most.
                    But here we have huge audiences gathered continuously, Sunday after Sunday,<pb n="193" xml:id="VAB7129-184"></pb> for years, and men and women devoting
                    themselves to the holding of services said to be of the âmost exhausting
                    character,â night after night, without intermission. How can any mere excitement
                    account for all this?</p>
                <p>A somewhat more reasonable theory is that the Army owes all its successes to a
                    ârigid discipline.â But is not this begging the whole question? That the Army
                    maintains and extends its influence largely as the result of military order and
                    system is undoubtedly true; but the question is how men and women, hitherto
                    averse to all religious control, and indeed, control of any kind, are induced to
                    submit themselves without fee or reward to the orders of those who are often in
                    every way their inferiors. Look at that young lad, not out of his teens,
                    commanding a corps in some large city. His every sign is obeyed by men and women
                    old enough to be his grandparents, by tradesmen who were accustomed to manage
                    business affairs before he learned arithmetic (what little he knows of it), by
                    sergeants and soldiers of the Army, who have served years longer than himself in
                    it, and some of whom know more of God and mankind, more of the work and
                    literature of the Army, than he does. Whence all this ready obedience, this
                    systematic labour under such leadership? It is easy to explain all upon âthe
                    love of Christ constraineth usâ principle, âsubmitting yourselves one to another
                    in love;â but take that away, and what becomes of the Armyâs discipline?</p>
                <p>The Armyâs discipline is all the more remarkable when we remember that it is
                    applied amongst all nations alike, and that in the worldâs three greatest<pb n="194" xml:id="VAB7129-185"></pb> Republics it is carried out as successfully
                    as amongst communities more accustomed to the idea of submission to absolute
                    authority. Moreover, the marvel of general and absolute obedience, rendered
                    without murmuring by persons of all sorts and conditions, scattered all over the
                    world, is all the more striking at a time when any approach to the exercise of
                    authority in connection with religious work is becoming more and more out of the
                    question.</p>
                <p>Just consider for a moment what this Army discipline amounts to. Forty thousand
                    times this week, and <emph>every</emph> week of this hot summer, bodies of men
                    and women are induced, after having toiled all day at their usual employment, to
                    walk more or less considerable distance from their homes, and place themselves
                    under the leadership of officers who keep them from two to three hours engaged
                    in praying, singing, speaking, marching through the streets, standing in narrow
                    dirty alleys and courts, or sitting on unbacked seats in the close atmosphere of
                    uncomfortable buildings. Yet this only represents the public services of the
                    Army. We give up in despair any attempt to calculate the number of hours spent
                    by scores of thousands of these soldiers in visiting, <bibl rend="i"><title>War
                        Cry</title></bibl> selling, and other labours, under the direction of their
                    officers. All this will bear investigation and consideration to any extent; and
                    the more it is considered, the more inevitable will be the conclusion that the
                    Armyâs strength within and without must arise from a power far superior to
                    anything human. If so, then the Army is everywhere a standing manifestation of
                    the saving <emph>power of God</emph>, and a standing reproof to the âmodern
                    thoughtâ which ignores that power.</p>
                <pb n="195" xml:id="VAB7129-186"></pb>
                <p>The oneâminded and oneâheartedness of the Army is strikingly exemplified in its
                    newspapers and its prayers. It has twentyâfour <bibl rend="i"><title>War Crys</title></bibl>,
                    published in as many different countries and colonies, in their several
                    languages. In not one of these can there be found any recognition of the
                    controversies which disturb the Christian world! They represent minds always
                    engaged upon the one subject, lives entirely devoted to the one objectâthe
                    subjugation of the world to the dominion of Jesus Christ. In prayer this
                    absolute union of heart and mind is even more remarkable. In the course of more
                    than twenty years there have of course arisen frequently within the Army
                    differences and disputings, which could not have been easily brought to an end
                    but for the exercise of a strong central authority; but it is a remarkable fact
                    that these differences have scarcely ever arisen from any variety of
                        <emph>opinions</emph>, and in only one or two instances from the
                    introduction of any new teaching. I was very much impressed lately with the
                    Armyâs oneness in prayer, during a tour in which I had the opportunity to
                    observe closely the action of soldiers of half a dozen different nations in
                    succession. I do not wonder that the Army is reproached with the constant use of
                    a few phrases, repeated over and over again. The accusation is gloriously
                    correct to this extentâthat officers and soldiers, to whatever class or nation
                    they may belong, and wherever you may meet them, appear to have their minds so
                    concentrated upon the one great theme, and their whole energies so thoroughly
                    called out for the accomplishment of the one result, that to hear one is to hear
                    all.</p>
                <p>Now to what conclusion can one come but that either<pb n="196" xml:id="VAB7129-187"></pb> all this union is produced by one Almighty Spirit
                    working âall in allââaccording to the Scriptures, making His real followers not
                    only of one spirit but âof one mind,â giving them to âsee light in His light,â
                    producing in every one the same purpose and the same entire subjection to the
                    will of Christ,âor else that we are in presence of the most astounding wonder of
                    the age, without having placed before us any means of accounting for its
                    existence?</p>
                <p>This becomes all the more evident when we look at the <emph>financial</emph>
                    system of the Army. To overcome the general indifference to religion and its
                    teachers, it has become common, in our time, to endeavour to induce the poor to
                    attend the ministrations of this or that religious community by the presentation
                    of gifts, or the provision of gratuitous entertainments. The Salvation Army, on
                    the other hand, goes to the people in every service with its collecting boxes,
                    and pays the rental of expensive buildings everywhere by means of the poor manâs
                    pence. Hundreds of thousands of pounds are contributed in this way annually, the
                    people not only meeting the cost of the services conducted in their own
                    immediate neighbourhood, but assisting in the extension of the Armyâs work all
                    over the world, and showing the greatest readiness to respond to every appeal
                    from new enterprises. There are multitudes of persons whose incomes are between 10<choice>

                    </choice> per week, who give to the Army one or two shillings of that amount,
                    besides devoting so much of their time and strength to its operations, as
                    already explained. The 5,000 officers who have given themselves up entirely to
                    the war, without the guarantee of any salary whatever, merely represent tens of
                        thousands<pb n="197" xml:id="VAB7129-188"></pb> more who would gladly do the
                    same thing, if we were able rapidly enough to arrange for their despatch to
                    every part of the great worldâfield. We had more than 1,000 such offers in a few
                    weeks of 1887, in England alone. To all these people home and comfort are as
                    enjoyable as to yourself or any one else; yet they glory in the possibility of a
                    while life of selfâdenying activity for Christ, and eagerly look forward to the
                    day when, far from home and old friends, their bodies shall be lowered into a
                    salvation soldierâs grave, amid the tears and prayers of others now revelling in
                    sinful indulgence, but induced by their life, example, and testimony to leave
                    all and follow Christ.</p>
                <p>Let no one say in presence of a vast assemblage of facts like this, that it is no
                    longer required of us, or no longer within our power, to follow in the footsteps
                    of the prophets and apostles of the past. Amidst the snows of Lapland, as well
                    as in the Indian jungle, on the outskirts of European occupancy in the far West
                    and the other side of the world, as well as in the midst of crowded European and
                    American cities, men and women are proving every day that the experiences of the
                    Psalms,âthe very experiences of Godâs presence and salvation, which in apostolic
                    days made the poor, despised, and persecuted followers of the Messiah the
                    happiest of beings,âare now within the reach of all who will equally deny
                    themselves, take up their cross and follow Him who became poor in order to make
                    others rich for ever.</p>
                <p>The Salvation Army deserves and demands the careful and patient study of all who
                    would learn how best to follow God and hasten the coming of His kingdom. The
                    more closely and carefully you examine,<pb n="198" xml:id="VAB7129-189"></pb> the
                    more fully will you be driven to the conclusionâthe opinions of the day to the
                    contrary, notwithstandingâthat those who truly wish to follow Christ at all
                    costs can do so in this age as well as in previous ones, and will succeed, just
                    as others have done before, in gaining the worldâs hatred, the smile of God, and
                    the victory which He guarantees to all who trust in and obey Him.</p>
