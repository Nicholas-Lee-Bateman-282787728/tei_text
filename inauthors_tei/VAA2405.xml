                    <hi rend="i">The New York Evening Post</hi> says:</p>
                <p>"Few works on the period which it covers can compare with this in point of mere
                    literary attractiveness, and we fancy that many to whom its scholarly value will
                    not appeal will read the volume with interest and delight."</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="i">The New York Times</hi> says:</p>
                <p>"Written with a firm grasp of the theme, inspired by ample knowledge, and made
                    attractive by a vigorous and resonant style, the book will receive much
                    attention. It is a great theme the author has taken up, and he grasps it with
                    the confidence of a master."</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="i">The Boston Saturday Evening Gazette</hi> says:</p>
                <p>"Mr. Eggleston's 'Beginners' is unique. No similar historical study has, to our
                    knowledge, ever been done in the same way. Mr. Eggleston is a reliable reporter
                    of facts; but he is also an exceedingly keen critic. He writes history without
                    the effort to merge the critic in the historian. His sense of humor is never
                    dormant. He renders some of the dullest passages in colonial annals actually
                    amusing by his witty treatment of them. He finds a laugh for his readers where
                    most of his predecessors have found yawns. And with all this he does not
                    sacrifice the dignity of history for an instant."</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="i">The Philadelphia Public Ledger</hi> says:</p>
                <p>"The delightful style, the clear flow of the narrative, the philosophical tone,
                    and the able analysis of men and events will recommend Mr. Eggleston's work to
                    earnest students."</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="i">The Boston Journal</hi> says:</p>
                <p>"The work is worthy of careful reading, not only because of the author's ability
                    as a literary artist, but because of his conspicuous proficiency in interpreting
                    the causes of and changes in American life and character."</p>

                <p>I<hi rend="sc">S</hi> seeking to give a history of the civilization of the
                    seventeenth century there was little help in anything American, and, to my
                    surprise, I found long ago that I could not count on anything English.<note
                        id="note_1" place="right" anchored="yes">
                        <p>Preface</p>
                    </note> There were many books on Shakespeare, more or less good when they were
                    not bad, and there was Masson's ponderous Life and Times of John Milton in six
                    octavo volumes. These afforded something, but the civilization of the century
                    was not told in any of them. It became necessary to build a description from the
                    ground. The complex states of knowing and thinking, of feeling and passion, must
                    be explained. The little world as seen by the man of the seventeenth century
                    must be understood. Its sun, moon, and planets were flames of fire without
                    gravity, revolved about the earth by countless angels; its God governed this one
                    little world with mock majesty. Its heaven, its horrible hell of material fire
                    blown by the mouth of God, its chained demons whose fetters might be loosed, its
                    damnation of infants were to be appreciated and expounded. The inhumanity of
                    punishments and of sport in that day, the mixture made of religion and
                    revengethese and a hundred other things went to make up the traits of the
                    century. To explain the things in this other age in which I found myself it was
                    necessary to go to England. To understand England one must understand the
                    Continent; to make this out one must often thread his way to antiquity. The use
                    of Latin by nearly all scholars made the world's knowledge more <pb
                        id="VAA2405-009" n="viii"/> or less common to all. My little corner widened
                    out into a part of all human history.</p>
                <p>Eclipses, parhelia, comets, were danger signals hung out in the heavens as
                    warnings. Logic was the only implement for the discovery of truth. Observation
                    was in its birth throes. Medicines were recognized by signaturism; on this
                    slender basis what a towering structure was built! Right and wrong were thought
                    of only as the result of direct revelation; they had not yet found standing room
                    in the great theater of natural knowledge. Until we understand these things we
                    write the history of the seventeenth century in vain. It is the last age which
                    sought knowledge of physical things by deduction. The next century brought
                    philosophy and philosophy dawned into science.</p>
                <p>We must apply to the seventeenth century the severe canons of history; people
                    with ancestors will be disappointed. We can not make out in the seventeenth
                    century the great destiny of Virginia in the eighteenth. We must not be sure
                    that the future greatness of later New England is wrapped up in the peculiarly
                    narrow and forbidding husk of the later seventeenth century. Nor can commercial
                    greatness be predicted of New York; nor did Pennsylvania show signs of the great
                    industries developed from her coal fields. The causes of greatness are not
                    always traceable. Where least looked for may develop the next group of statesmen
                    and authors, of inventors and great merchants. We may write history, but we may
                    not prophesy.</p>

                            </note> Seminal ideas received in childhood, standards of feeling and
                            thinking and living handed down from one overlapping generation to
                            another, make the man English or French or German in the rudimentary
                            outfit of his mind. A gradual change in fundamental notions produces the
                            difference between the character of a nation at an early epoch and that
                            of the same people in a later age. In taking account of the mental
                            furniture which the early English emigrants carried aboard ship with
                            them, we shall gain a knowledge of what may be called the original
                            investment from which has been developed Anglo-Saxon culture in America.
                            The mother country of the United States was England in the first half of
                            the seventeenth century, or, at most, England before the Revolution of
                            1688. From the English spoken in the days of the Stuart kings came <pb
                                id="VAA2405-013" n="2"/> our primitive speech, and the opinions,
                            prejudices, and modes of thinking of the English in that day lay at the
                            bottom of what intellectual life there was in the colonies. Some
                            seventeenth-century characteristics, long since lost or obscured in
                            England, may yet be recognized in the folk-lore and folk-speech, the
                            superstitions and beliefs of people in America. The number of English
                            who crossed the seas before the middle of the century was above thirty
                            thousand. Those who survived the first rude outset of pioneer life, with
                            their fast-multiplying progeny, numbered probably fifty thousand in
                            1650, and this population was about halved between the colonies on the
                            Chesapeake waters and those to the northward of the Dutch settlement on
                            the New England coast. To these early comers it is due that the speech,
                            the usages, the institutions, and the binding traditions of the United
                            States are English.</p>

                            of the dominance of planets over plants, minerals, and diseases. The

                            headway slowly. In the interval between the landing of the Jamestown
                            gold hunters and that of the Plymouth Pilgrims, the great Kepler,
                            working in obscurity, developed the three principles which are the
                            foundations of modern astronomy. It was two years before the beginning
                            of the Plymouth settlement that, in poverty and neglect, he wrote:

                            convictions he said in the same year, "My book may well wait a hundred

                            to cut his brushwood in certain signs of the zodiac and in the decrease
                            of the moon, that it might not grow again, but to cut firewood in the
                            increase. Timber to last must be cut in the last quarter of the moon. So
                            Tusser, in his Points of Good Husbandry, says, "The moon in the wane

                            ecclesiastical luminary of the first generation, drew near his end, a
                            comet appeared which "went out" soon after the preacher's death. The
                            blight of 1665, that put an end to the hope of prosperity from
                            wheat-raising in Massachusetts, was heralded by "a great and blazing
                            comet," which, like all portents and omens, lacked definiteness, for it
                            was "accompanied with many sad effects" beside. John Hull, the pine-tree
                            shilling-maker, calls the attention of a correspondent to the comet of
                            1680 with a pious ejaculation of alarm: "The Lord fit us and you for all
                            his will and pleasure." A protagonist of Puritanism in its decline was

                            after any comet, were once more rehearsed, as they had been rehearsed in
                            other times by other sensational moralists. The notable comet of 1680,
                            which set so many watchdogs baying at the sky, alarmed the Dutch
                            dwellers on the upper Hudson, as we may see in a letter dispatched by
                            their usual post, an Indian runner, to New York. In this they mention
                            the "Dreadful comett starr" "with a very fyery Tail or Streemer."
                            "Undoubtedly God threatens us," is their inference, and they crave
                            permission of superior authority in New York to cause "the Domine" to

                            quoted his verses on the subject and saved themselves the necessity of
                            observation. The practical bee-keeper of the seventeenth century did not
                            read the classics, or Gesner or Mouffet, or any of the other innumerable
                            Latin treatises on animal life, but he did look into his hive
                            occasionally, and he knew that a bee came from a "little worm" in the
                            comb. Bees taken from England to Virginia and New England prospered. But
                            the traveler Josselyn entertained the hope that, when the carnivorous
                            animals should have been exterminated, American bees might be produced
                            from dead bullocks, after the approved scientific formula. Some kinds of
                            wasps had their origin in the decay of apples and pears; the most
                            superficial observer might find them to his sorrow issuing from the
                            fruit. Minnows were produced from foam, carp came from putrid slime, the
                            oyster, the nautilus, and other shellfish from different kinds of
                            putrescence mixed sometimes with mud, sometimes combined with the sand
                            of the sea bottom. So far did Nature carry this economy that even the
                            discarded tails of New England tadpoles were not suffered to go to
                            waste: out of them were formed the water newts, as Josselyn takes pains

                            distant resting places were yet undiscovered. Following the analogy of
                            the accepted theory regarding the production of "insects," including
                            frogs, mice, and snakes, there were those who derived many birds from
                            wood rotting in the water, or from decaying fruits. Others said that
                            some birds grew on trees, and proved it by showing the shells of the
                            nuts from which the bird had emerged. The so-called barnacle goose had

                            to take flight. Easy-going casuists treated the barnacle goose as a fish
                            by virtue of its marine origin, and it was served up to monks and other
                            self-indulgent fasters on Fridays. Such a myth could not be long held in
                            solution by American tradition; barnacle geese were not found, and the

                            that they had drawn up torpid swallows in their nets which came to life
                            on warming. He even gave all the details of their taking refuge for the
                            winter in the clay at the bottom of the river. Once this fond story of
                            the fishermen got itself printed in Latin and authenticated by a bishop,
                            it became a scientific fact. The new notion almost crowded out the old
                            folk-theory of hibernation in caves and holes, and held its own for two
                            centuries, to be reluctantly discarded almost in our time. The
                            revelations of the telescope made the moon seem near, and Bishop Godwin
                            formed a new theory of hibernation in the satellites, which was

                            to the Royal Society in which he suggested that the prodigious flights
                            of pigeons in the colonies rendered probable the existence of an unseen,
                            near-at-hand satellite, from which came these myriads of birds, and to
                            which they were wont to retreat again. But the English colonists who
                            touched elbows with Nature, and had larger opportunities for observation
                            than their island ancestors, came to accept the annual migration of the
                            disappearing birds before the middle of the eighteenth century. There
                            were, however, learned pundits in Philadelphia as late as 1800, who
                            followed Olaus in wintering their swallows in the bottoms of the

                            executed. Medical skill was dangerous in a time of suspicion. Meric

                            sort that masqueraded as dogs and cats, and hares and toads. They
                            haunted houses for the mere fun of terrifying the inmates; they took
                            possession of hysterical people and talked nonsense from their lips, and
                            they tangled the manes of horses in the night for mere wanton deviltry.
                            The antipathies of these demons were equally incomprehensible. They
                            could be frightened away by <pb id="VAA2405-034" n="23"/> hanging up
                            lucky stones with natural holes in them, or discarded horseshoes, or
                            better still by burying "witch-jugs" full of horseshoe nails under a
                            threshold, or by the hanging up of fresh bays about a house.<note

                            chains and permit these diabolonians "to exhibit themselves under some
                            assumed shapes unto men," which gives the eminent casuist occasion to
                            discuss "what our deportment should be" when a devil whose chain has
                            been temporarily slackened "exhibits" himself to us. This very
                            materialistic conception of the devils in chains like mastiffs is not
                            peculiar to Hall. It was a trait of thought at the time. It occurs more
                            than once in Increase Mather, as "the Lord doth sometimes lengthen the
                            chain which the infernal lions are bound fast in," and so on. In the
                            trials at Salem we repeatedly come upon the expression in a grossly
                            literal sense.</p>

                            sticks and stones on the roof of the house, lifted up the bedstead from
                            the floor, threw the bedstaff out the window, threw a cat at the

                            the disheartened demon was heard to cry six times over, "Alas ! me knock
                            no more !" In Hartford, in 1683, there was a gentle devil with a taste
                            for flinging corncobs through the windows and down the chimney. Stones
                            and sticks were sometimes thrown, but softly so as to do no serious
                            harm. When the occupant of the haunted house returned to its owner a
                            chest of clothes unjustly detained, no more corncobs were thrown. In

                            devil amused himself like a true brownie by hanging the haycocks up in
                            the trees and decorating the kitchen "all up and down" with wisps of
                            hay. Sometimes the chains were sufficiently lengthened for a New England
                            demon to become visible. One appeared as a "black-a-moor child," another
                            as a woman clad in green safeguard, short blue cloak, and white cap.
                            Once the black cat, so dear to tradition, appeared and was shot at;
                            again the head of a man was seen swimming through the water, followed a
                            little way off by the tail of a white cat. These American devils with
                            their undiabolical sense of humor have at least a family likeness to the
                            mischievous elves, pucks, brownies, and other "tricksy sprites" with
                            which the English imagination peopled lonesome glens and the dark
                            corners of their houses in primitive times. Whether the later demons
                            were creatures of excited fancy or of imposture, or both, they were cast
                            in molds supplied by ancient tradition.</p>

                        <p>In the Massachusetts town of Groton, in 1671, occurred a case of

                            violent contortions and "ravings" of the patient, Elizabeth Knap,
                            "represented a dark resemblance to hellish torments." When in one of her
                            fits she cried out, "What cheer, old man?" to whom could she be speaking
                            if not to the devil? Like many other hysterical sufferers, she was
                            susceptible to hypnotic suggestion, and in answer to leading questions
                            she was able to remember having made the compact with Satan always

                            found all this so exciting that they, though unable to see the

                            revolting as well as unbelievable, were disseminated as religious
                            reading, in hope that they might prove a means of grace by revulsion. If
                            any man had the courage to question the supernatural character of these
                            disgusting apparitions, he found himself gazetted in the authoritative
                            writings of eminent divines as a Sadducee, a patron of witches, and a
                            witch advocate; if he took a neutral position for safety, averring the
                            existence of witchcraft but denying the possibility of proving it in
                            particular cases, he was dubbed a "nullibist." This in America as well
                            as in England. A new case of witchcraft did not excite pity, but
                            something like exultation; the Sadducees were again confounded. The
                            Puritan ram's horn of Increase Mather answered across the seas to the
                            bugle of Glanvill, chaplain in ordinary to Charles II, and late in the
                            century the good Richard Baxter himself re-echoed Cotton Mather's shout
                            of victory amid the horrors of the judicial massacre at Salem. Reports
                            of continental witch trials were translated for the edification of
                            Englishmen. By this array of frightful diabolism it was <pb

                            immorality might be checked and religion promoted, for the appeal of
                            religion in that day was to fear rather than to aspiration; the peril of
                            trying to kindle altar fires with embers from hell was not
                                understood.<note id="note_116" place="left" anchored="yes">

                        <p>Salem village, an outlying suburb, two or three miles from Salem proper,
                            was almost a frontier town in 1692. Men still wore buckskin breeches and
                            hats with a brim narrow in front and long behind. Wolves, bears, and
                            catamounts were trapped. Some of the settlers had participated in the
                            desperate battle at the Narragansetts' town sixteen years before. The
                            sword and the rapier were still worn at the side, the fowling piece six
                            and seven feet in length was in use. Men had been killed by the Indians
                            in the bounds of Salem within three years. Education was generally
                            neglected; even men of substance were sometimes unable to write. The old
                            patriarchs who had made the settlement had just died off; the community
                            had lost its steadfast guides. New clergymen had come in and new
                            magistrates, not with the education of England, but with the scantier
                            training of New Englanda training in which the felling axe was more
                            important than the Latin grammar. The new clergy, men of the second and
                            third generations, were, with a few exceptions, profoundly impressed
                            with the necessity of believing <pb id="VAA2405-041" n="30"/> anything
                            ghostly or horrible; the supernatural was the basis of their piety.
                            Increase Mather, the bishop by brevet of New England, had published
                            books on the ominous eclipses of 1680 and 1682, and another in 1686 on
                            Illustrious Providences, which was a storehouse of those dragons' teeth
                            that bore such ample fruit in 1692. His abler but less judicious son,
                            Cotton, had issued a book on "Memorable Providences relating to
                            witchcraft and Possessions." It had come to a second edition in the very
                            year before the horrors of Salem.</p>
                        <p>The village of Salem had the elements needed for a witchcraft maniaa
                            quarrel between minister and people; a circle of young girls from eleven
                            to twenty, including some who worked as helps, who met at the minister's
                            house and practiced together folk-sorcery and that kind of divining that
                            has been the amusement of such for ages. These girls soon began to
                            manifest symptoms of hysteria and hypnotism; one or two married women
                            also had "fits" in sympathy with them. A doctor called to attend them
                            decided that they were afflicted by "an evil hand." There was some
                            heartless and heedless imposture, no doubt, in what followed, but there
                            was also much of self-deception.</p>
                        <p>The glimpses of the infernal world that we get in Salem are highly
                            incredible. The witches say prayers to a tall black man with a
                            high-crowned hatalways with a high-crowned hat. They ride on sticks and
                            poles, sometimes they are on brooms, <pb id="VAA2405-042" n="31"/> and
                            sometimes three are on one pole. One relates that a pole carrying two
                            broke, but, by holding fast to the one in front of her, the witch got
                            safe to her destination. The witches fondle yellow birds, suckling them
                            between their fingers, and one day a girl cries out in meeting that a
                            yellow bird sits on the minister's hat as it hangs on a pin on the
                            pulpit. The witch usually sits on the great cross-beam of the
                            meetinghouse, fondling the yellow bird. One man was seen to nurse two
                            black pigs at his breasts. Sometimes a hog, sometimes a black dog,
                            appears and says, "Serve me." Then the dog or pig "looks like a man,"
                            and this man has a yellow bird. Cats naturally abound, white cats and
                            red cats and cats without color. Once a man struck with a rapier at a
                            place designated by one of the girls, and she declared the cat dead and
                            the floor to be all covered with blood. But no one else saw it. This is
                            probably hypnotism, hardly imposture. A great mass of such inconsequent
                            and paltry foolery was believed, not alone by owl-blasted children, but
                            by Stoughton and the other judges, and by pious Samuel Sewall himself,
                            more's the pity! Where is the motive? What prompted the most eminent
                            Christians and leading citizens to prefer so base a lifecompanions to
                            cats and dogs and devils? Why did this torture of innocent children,
                            this mischief-working witchcraft with endless perdition at the tail of
                            it, give pleasure to rational creatures? The court never once thought to
                            ask.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA2405-043" n="32"/>
                        <p>The trials scenes were perdition. The "afflicted children" screamed, went
                            into spasms, shouted, charged the prisoners with torturing them, and
                            their apparent torments were frightful. They laid to the charge of the
                            accused unheard-of deviltries, such as the killing of wives long dead,
                            attempting to choke aged grandparents, and what not besides. Husbands in
                            some instances turned against wives, in others they adhered to them,
                            were accused themselves, and died with them.</p>
                        <p>The trials were accompanied by great cruelties. Officers of the law were
                            allowed to plunder the estates of the accused of all movable property.
                            The prisoners had to pay their jail expenses, and many families were
                            utterly impoverished. Prisoners were cast into the dungeon and were
                            "fettered." Goodman Hutchinson complained of certain prisoners for
                            tormenting his wife; additional fetters were put on them, after which
                            Mrs. Hutchinson was "tolerable well." Some were tortured to make them
                            confess; lads were laid neck and heels until the blood gushed from their
                            noses. These were accredited practices at the time. Several died in
                            prison.</p>
                        <p>The very skill of the accused was against them. One very neat woman
                            walked miles over dirty roads without showing any mud. "I scorn to be
                            drabbled," she said, and she was hanged for her cleanliness. George
                            Burroughs, the minister, was a strong man, much addicted to gymnastics.
                            He carried barrels of cider by inserting his fingers into <pb
                                id="VAA2405-044" n="33"/> the bunghole, and held a seven-foot gun at
                            arm's length. He was the devil's man, away with him to the gallows! The
                            first people in the colony became involved. Twenty in all were executed,
                            four or five at a time. Their bodies were ignominiously thrust into
                            holes at the place where they were executed and were scantly covered.</p>
                        <p>There were brave men and women among them. Giles Corey, an eccentric old
                            man, had at first signed an affidavit of uncertainty about his wife, a
                            woman of piety, and, strange to say, an entire unbeliever in witchcraft.
                            Two of his sons-in-law turned against her, two were for her. But when
                            old Giles was accused he stiffened his neck. He would save his property,
                            which was considerable and might be compromised; he would will it all to
                            his two faithful sons-in-law. He would prove his steadfastness. He made
                            a will, perfect in every part, giving his property to the sons-in-law,
                            and then totally refused to plead and was slowly pressed to death. The
                            constancy of the old man did much to overthrow the partisans of
                            witchcraft. Joseph Putnam, a young man of twenty-two, declared his
                            detestation of the doctrine. He kept some one of his horses bridled and
                            saddled for six months. He armed all his family, and it was understood
                            that he must be taken, if taken at all, pistol in hand. When the mania
                            was at its height he refused to have his child baptized in the village,
                            but carried it to Salem.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA2405-045" n="34"/>
                        <p>The excitement had risen with every arrest.<note id="note_117"

                                <p>Note 21.</p>
                            </note> More than fifty badgered souls had confessed that they were
                            witches. Some had fled the country. But the wide extent of the
                            accusations produced a change in the minds of the people. They knew not
                            who would be struck at next. The governor, at length, refused to call
                            the special court together, and after a tedious confinement a hundred
                            and fifty were released by proclamation. The population of Salem had
                            decreased, its business had suffered, and perhaps it never recovered its
                            prosperity. Slowly the people got over the delusion and came to realize
                            the incalculable and irretrievable harm that had been wrought. Judge
                            Sewall, at a general fast, handed up to the minister to be read a humble
                            confession, and stood while it was read. He annually kept a private day
                            of humiliation. Honor to his memory! The twelve jurymen also signed an
                            affecting paper asking to be forgiven. Cotton Mather, who had been very
                            conspicuous and had published a book about it, never acknowledged
                            himself wrong in this or any other matter. From the time it became
                            unpopular he speaks of the witchcraft trials in a far-away manner, as if
                            they were wholly the work of some one else. He was never forgiven, and
                            probably never ought to have been.</p>
                        <p>The revulsion was complete. No witches were tried or hanged or "swimmed"
                            in America after the Salem trials. In half a lifetime more the ardor of
                            the English people visibly abated, and few witches were thereafter
                            arrested in England.</p>

                        <p>In 1666 Samuel Danforth published, in Cambridge, Mass., a book entitled
                            An Astronomical Description of the Late Comet or Blazing Star. It was
                            reprinted in London. He maintained that its orbit was elliptical, and
                            that its center of motion was not the eartha long stride toward
                            Copernicus. He proved that it was a celestial luminary by its size, its
                            parallax, its duration, its visibility in many countries, etc., and
                            concludes that it is a "planetick or erratick body." It was observed
                            without instruments. Alexander <pb id="VAA2405-047" n="36"/> Nowell, a
                            Harvard graduate of the previous year, published an almanac in which he
                            argues in opposition to the old notion that planets have no light of
                            their own, and in 1667 he issued a little booklet which I have not seen,

                            </note> In 1674 a thesis for the master's degree at Harvard affirmed the
                            old opinion that the starry heavens were of fire, but in 1688 it was
                            maintained that the material of the celestial and terrestrial bodies
                            were the same, which may have been as far in the direction of the new
                            astronomy as it was safe to go at that time. Young's Subjects for
                            Master's Degree, 15. On the notion of the heavenly bodies as free from
                            gravitation, compare Hakewill's Apologie, 1630: "They are not subject to
                            the qualities of heat and cold, or drought and moisture, nor yet to
                            weight and lightnesse which arise from those qualities," p. 73. "Light
                            bodies naturally moove vpward and heavy downwarde, that which is neither
                            light nor heavy is rather disposed to a circular motion," etc., p. 86.
                            See a passage on pp. 85 and 86 on the various hypotheses of celestial
                            motion. In the entire discussion this English divine, learned in the
                            lore of the day, does not think it worth while to mention Copernicus or
                            Tycho, or either of his own great contemporaries, Kepler or Galileo. The
                            Copernican theory was a stone rejected of the builders.</p>
                        <p>The calculation is based on the "decumbiture or the time when sickness
                            envaded or ceased [seized] on Allice Wilkins," which was January 11,
                            1656, at 6 P. M. This is the only American case of which I know any
                            record. "That ye pty is really sick is evident in yt the lord of ye
                            ascendant is not in essential dignity, but in his detriment &amp; in

                            back." So runs on our astrologer until "the stone of the kidneys" is
                            somewhat suddenly hit upon as the disease. The book is in the Winthrop
                            collection in the New York Society Library. There was formerly care
                            taken to administer medicine when the "sign came right"; laxatives were
                            to be given when the moon was in Libra or other favorable
                            constellations, and the <pb id="VAA2405-048" n="37"/> approach of Saturn
                            was to be guarded against because that malign planet congealed the

                        <p>Archdeacon Hakewill, in his Apologie, traces the regulation of farm

                            Hesiod. Hakewill mentions the moon's supposed influence on lunatics, the
                            selenite, a stone whose light is said to wax and wane with the moon, the
                            tides, etc. "The physitian in opening a veine hath ever an eie to the

                            severall eclypses of the sunne in Aries," p. 151. Hakewill thinks the
                            stars "not signes only," but "causes of immoderate cold or heat, drought
                            or moysture, lightning, thunder, raging windes, inundations,
                            earthquakes, and consequently of famine and pestilence"; but he admits
                            that "the prognostication is very vncertane." The popularity of
                            astrology in the seventeenth century is manifest from the frequent
                            references to it, and from the great number of books published on the
                            subject. The doctrine of correspondence connected astrology closely with
                            every other science. Some of the clergy opposed it. See, for example,
                            Henry King's sermon at St. Paul's, 1621, p. 25, and, earlier, Hall's
                            Satires, liber ii, satire vii. As early as 1577, indeed, the Bishop of
                            Winchester, writing to Sir W. More, says that he would gladly know the
                            opinion of astrologers relative to the "tayled star." He would "gladly
                            learn what they find in the lower heavens, for to the higher they never
                            will ascend." Losely MSS., 491. The reader may compare Hakewill's
                            Apologie, 126, 128, edition of 1630. The troublous time of the great
                            rebellion led many in England to see signs in the heavens, and brought
                            about an increase of interest in astrology. The opinions prevailing more
                            and more among the best-informed men of the time are set forth <pb

                            the first part, in which Castrillo concludes that "the movements or
                            aspects of the heavens are not certain indications of free acts and
                            contingent consequences, for these are subject to changes independently

                            necessity for some rational explanation of the generally believed

                            and he was himself little content with it. "Haec igitur est, si vlla
                            est, naturalis connexio horum euentuum cum Cometa."It would have been
                            but a short step from this to the rejection of calamitous comets, head
                            and tail. The works that treat of the ominous character of comets were a
                            considerable element in the literature of Europe in the seventeenth
                            century. Christiani, in 1633, declares that man but a stranger in
                            history who denies that God threatens this "worn-out world" by means of
                            dreadful comets, multiplied by suns, and other portentous phenomena. The
                            passage is quoted by Votius in his Excertatio de Prognosticus Cometarum,
                            1665. Votius lays stress on the universal consent both of learned and
                            vulgar to the bad reputation of comets. Dr. John Spencer, afterward Dean
                            of Ely, protested in a learned and liberal little book that comets were
                            not ominous. In this Discourse concerning Prodigies, 1663, this
                            large-minded divine maintains that God has no use for "any such winding
                            and squintey'd Oracles" as those of the heathen. He aptly characterizes
                            the traditionary science of that day in a single phrase: "A Series of
                            many Assertours which (like persons in the dark) shut their eyes and
                            take care onely to hold fast by those which went before them." First

                            calves. Kings and Ieaders among the bees are produced from the brain and
                            spinal marrow, common bees from the flesh. My copy of Movertus has on

                            1649. This is much nearer the truth. Vossius says that the "seed "of the
                            "king" bee, laid in single cells, is like a poppy seed, and from it the
                            little grubs are produced. Movertus, or, as his name is in English,
                            Mouffet, was the first authoritative writer on insects in England. His
                            work was translated in 1658 into English, but I have not had access to
                            an English version. Butler's Feminine Monarchie, published in 1634, the
                            same year with Movertus, shows how much the practical bee-keeper knew
                                <pb id="VAA2405-051" n="40"/> that was not suspected by the man of
                            science. Butler holds the principal bee to be a female, but does not
                            know that she was the only fertile female. He knows the drones to be
                            males, and he does not mention the spontaneous generation of bees from
                            bullocks, which had come down from more than two thousand years on the
                            authority of Aristotle and other classic writers. John Baptist Porta, in
                            his Magia Naturalis, 1644, page 53, quotes from Ovid a passage about
                            bodies that in wasting are changed to little animalsin parva animalia
                            vertiand this of the birth of flower-gathering bees from the waste of
                            slaughtered beeves:</p>

                        <p>This passage suggests the absence of any considerable power of scientific
                            observation in centuries preceding the eighteenth. A recent French
                            writer says of the seventeenth: "L'esprit d'observation et fortiori
                            d'exprimentation, qui nous semble si natural l'homme d'tude, tait peine

                            </note>" Movertus, Insectorum Theatrum, 1634, explains the rise of
                            differing parasites on various parts of the human body, p. 260: "Ex
                            humoribus carne adipe, sudoribusque corruptis ortum habent omnes
                            pediculi; et pro loci humorisque natura longe different." The generation
                            of such parasites he regards as an unmistakable sign of misery and
                            sometimes an inevitable scourge of God. This was the notion that
                            Nathaniel Bacon's opponents made the most of in Virginia. On vital
                            products of the putrid humors of the human body, see Levinus Lemnius De
                            Miracvlis Occvltis Natvr, liber iv, page 403 (1604). Lemnius says that
                            snakes are produced from the decay of the spinal marrow.</p>

                            spontaneously generated sometimes <pb id="VAA2405-052" n="41"/>
                            reproduce their kind by procreation. Compare section 900. Dade's Almanac
                            for 1684 says that an unusual number of frogs, flies, locusts, and so
                            on, is a sign of a pestilential season. "For these creatures, being
                            ingendered of Putrefaction, shew a general disposition of the Year and
                            constitution of the Aire to Putrefaction." In one of the early volumes
                            of the Royal Society's Transactions is a proposition to produce
                            cochineal dye in England by generation of insects from putrefaction. Sir
                            Kenelm Digby, then much esteemed, says that the earth at the outset was
                            most "aptly tempered and dispos'd" and "brought forth perfect animals;
                            as it now being barrener, of its own accord, produces such as we call
                            insecta, as Mice and Frogs, and sometimes new fashion'd Animals."
                            Peripatetical Institutions, appendix 356, 357. The underlying thought in
                            science and theology was that the world was "worn out" or in decay, and
                            the general effect was a paralyzing pessimism. It was not worth while to
                            do anything notable so near the world's end, as there would be "scarcely
                            any posterity to inherit its memory." See Milton's University oration in
                            Masson, i, 230, and Hakewill's Apologie, generally with others on "great
                            sickness and malice of the times." On spontaneous generation compare
                            Browne's Vulgar Errors, 78, 107, 109, 193, and especially on p. 148 his
                            allusion to "the receipt to make Mice out of Wheat which Helmont hath
                            delivered." Increase Mather in his Illustrious Providences says that
                            demons can make insects, no seminal virtue being required. Compare also
                            Early English Text Society, v, 229, on the generation of eels. But a new
                            spirit of wholesome scientific skepticism was born in the seventeenth
                            century. The first to question the "equivocal generation" of insects, so
                            far as I know, was Aramatori, in a letter written in 1625. Tiraboschi,
                            Letteratura Italiana, xiv, 433. Meantime Dr. William Harvey, one of the
                            first scientific minds of the world, took up the subject of generation
                            and published his researches in 1651. In these his genius struck out the
                            great truth that every animal is from the egg. In regard to insects and
                            their spontaneous generation he speaks ambiguously, but the portion of
                            his work devoted to the generation of insects was destroyed or lost in
                            the civil war, and we can never know just how far he had advanced. See
                            Dr. Ent's letter in Willis's translation of Harvey's works, Sydenham
                            Society, 148, and the passages in Harvey on Generation, 170, 456. Werner
                            Rolfink, of Jena, the most learned of German anatomists, and a follower
                            of Harvey, published a textbook on chemistry in 1661 in which he
                            rejected palingenesis.</p>

                        <p>Sprengel's Geschichte der Arzneikunde, iv, 364. About this time the
                            infant Royal Society of London was listening to papers on "the equivocal
                            generation of insects," on "the making of insects with cheese and sack,"
                            and on "the generation of insects out of dead cantharides"; but there
                            was one paper whose title implies true experimentation "of Flesh not
                            breeding Worms when secured from fly-blowings." Sprat's Royal Society,
                            198, 223. The times were ripening for a great discoverer who should, in
                            spite of Aristotle, extinguish the ancient error and clear the way for
                            modern biology. In 1686 Redi, a Franciscan monk, and also an
                            enthusiastic advocate of Harvey's doctrines, published his experiments,
                            showing that "none were generated by putrefaction as the ancients
                            believed." Even so great a naturalist as John Ray was rather slow to
                            receive so surprising a conclusion. Transactions of the Royal Society,
                            Abridgment ii, 765. But though Redi conceded in the spirit of the old
                            philosophy that the "vegetable soul of the plant" might produce the
                            anomalous little creatures found in excrescences, his general conclusion
                            is a broad one: "Venga tutta dalla Semenza reale, e vera della piante
                            degli animali stessi, i quali col mezzo dal proprio seme loro Spezia
                            conservano." Opere, iii, 15.</p>

                            "Gerarde in his History of Plants, 1588, tells us what he had seen with
                            his Eyes and touched with his hands Shells in shape like those of a
                            Muscle out of which in time comes the shape and form of a Bird, which
                            when it is perfectly formed the shell opens, and the Bird comes forth,
                            hanging by the Bill; in short space after it comes to maturity and falls
                            into the Sea where it gets Feathers." But the notion had been contested,
                            and Salmon gives some statements in opposition, citing strong words from
                            the closing part of Fabius Columna's Phytobasanos, pp. 507-511. For

                            Johnson, whose chief merit was that he could translate a thing into
                            Latin-English, says "the swallows conglobulate themselves," and so fall
                            down. White, of Selbourne, struggled with the question of the
                            hibernation of swallows; unable to verify the Scandinavian notion of
                            torpor in the mud at the bottom of rivers and pools, he finally accepts
                            in part the older English belief. He says that "many of the swallow kind
                            do not depart from this island, but lay themselves up in holes and
                            caverns, and do, insect-like and bat-like, come forth at mild times, and
                            then retire again into their latebrae or lurking places." The letter
                            from which this was taken was written in 1772. I am indebted to Mrs.
                            Ripley Hitchcock for calling my attention to White's discussion of the
                            question, and for this list of references to Mr. Burrough's edition: i,
                            35, 49, 81, 91, 149, 156, 175; ii, 1, 41, 83, 140, 147, 158, 164. Kalm
                            found the Scandinavian theory prevalent among the descendants of the old
                            Swedish colony on the Delaware. The Dutch at Albany held the other
                            theory of repose in holes in the rocks, while the Canadians and English
                            settlers had somehow come to believe in migration. Kalm's Travels, ii,
                            146. But the theory of torpidity was held by the Philadelphia naturalist
                            Barton, in the latter part of the eighteenth century. Ord's Life of
                            Wilson, 191. According to William Bartram, "very celebrated men" were
                            able to believe in it in 1792, and I have somewhere seen a paper,
                            published in Philadelphia as late as 1800, combating the very tough
                            delusion that swallows hibernated in the water. In the American
                            Philosophical Transactions, vi, p. 59 (1801), is a story thirty years
                            old told by Colonel Antes of a swallow taken out of the slime in
                            February. Salmon, whose English Physician, or the Druggist's Shop
                            Opened, is dated 1693, does not mention either of the theories of
                            hibernation so much discussed earlier and later. He treats the swallow,
                            the throstle, and the fieldfare as migratory, on the authority of
                            Aldrovandus and Peter Martyr. Dante held to migration: "Come le augei
                            the vernan lungo il Nilo." Purgatory, xxiv, line 63. It probably holds
                            good of the Latin races that they knew the facts from their residence on
                            the Mediterranean.</p>

                        <p>Richard, in his Dissertation sur la Possession des corps par les dmons,
                            Amiens, 1746, attributes to the Anabaptists the opinion that the word
                            angel is only the name of an office, and that scriptural angels are
                            subjective apparitions, or rather "les bonne ou les mauvaises penses."
                            Dufresnoy's Recueil de Dissertations sur les Apparitions, tome ii, part
                            i, page 196. No such opinion, I think, existed among the New England
                            Puritans; but good angels were not so conspicuous in the theology of the
                            colonies generally as were bad demons. Cotton Mather had great hopes of
                            what good angels might do for him, but that was wholly personal, and
                            born of an imagination that could not be contained within limits.

                        <p>See the remarks of Sprengel on the increase of demonism after the
                            Reformation, Geschichte der Arzneikunde, iii, 273, 274. Luther inherited
                            the traditions of the humble class from which he sprang, and set the
                            first Protestant example of extreme faith in witchcraft, berating the
                            medical men who traced diseases to natural causes, most of which he
                            himself attributed to the devil. He advised that an afflicted child
                            should be cast into the river Mulde, and complained afterward that he
                            was not obeyed. After the Reformation melancholy and hysterical women
                            could no longer relieve their morbid sense of culpability by a
                            meritorious pilgrimage. Perhaps this sort of faith cure was the greatest
                            benefit of the old religion lost by the Lutheran revolution. Puritanism
                            sometimes drove such brain-sick creatures to stark madness.</p>
                        <p>The entirely unlawful ordeal by water was retained in Protestant England
                            after that which gave it virtue, the prayers of the priest in tying the
                            thumbs and toes together and his solemn adjuration to the water, was
                            suppressed. The wise King James, in his Demonology, felt bound to find
                            another reason for the witch's floating. According to that Solomon, the
                            water rejected her for having renounced baptism in her bargain with the
                            devil. A full account of the ancient ordeal by water as practiced on the
                            Continent <pb id="VAA2405-057" n="46"/> is given by a Dutch writer,
                            Scheltema, in his Geschiedenis der Heksenprocessen, pp. 69 and 70, and
                            the note in the appendix, 18 and 19, where also the mode of exorcising
                            devils is described.<note id="note_136" place="left" anchored="yes">

                            </note> The English witch-finders in the seventeenth century not only
                            lacked the prayers and adjurations of the priests, but the rack having
                            been disused, they were compelled to substitute the torture of enforced
                            vigils and incessant walking to wring confessions from their
                                victims.<note id="note_137" place="left" anchored="yes">

                            </note> Both Scheltema and Hutchinson express their belief that the mode
                            of holding the rope had much to do with the witch's floating. See an
                            account of "swimming" a man and a woman at Hartford, Conn., in Mather's
                            Illustrious Providences. Mather strongly disapproves of the custom,
                            which was obsolete in the south of Europe in his time. It was also
                            opposed by all the German academies. Mather cites Sprenger that it had
                            formerly been used for those accused of other crimes. "The devil is in
                            it," he says. The declaration of Chief-Justice Parker, in 1712, that if
                            any supposed witch should thereafter die in the dangerous ordeal, those
                            who put her into the water would be held guilty of willful murder, is
                            commonly said to have put an end to the rare sport of baiting old women
                            in England; but, according to Hutchinson, it appears to have been still
                            in vogue some years laten. A man was "swam for a wizard" in Suffolk,
                            England, as late as 1825. Hone's Every Day Book, i, 942, quoting London
                            Times of July 19, 1825. It is to the credit of Increase Mather that he
                            insists that witch confessions should be voluntary.</p>
                        <p>As late as June 14, 1711, Addison printed in The Spectator, No. 117, his
                            famous essay on witchcraft. "I believe in general," he says, "that there
                            is and has been such a thing as witchcraft, but at the same time can
                            give no credit to any particular instances of it." The politic position
                            taken by Montesquieu in his Esprit des Lois, 1747, livre xii, ch. v, was
                            not very different from Addison's; and Blackstone puts himself under
                            shelter of Addison and Montesquieu; Commentaries, book iv, chapter iv.
                            It was those who believed thus in evil spirits generally, but refused
                            the evidence in particular cases, that Glanvill calls "nullibists" or
                            no-where-ists.</p>
                        <p>In Browne's Vulgar Errors, 148, it is set down to be considered "whether
                            the brains of Cats be attended with such destructive malignities as
                            Dioscorides and others put upon them." See a passage on this subject in
                            Parey's works, book 21, chapter xxxiv. It is to be remembered that
                            though Par was not an <pb id="VAA2405-058" n="47"/> English writer, his
                            works were translated into English and his name spelled Parey.<note

                        <p>I have not thought it necessary to fall into what Milton calls a
                            "paroxysm of citations" on this subject. I have given authorities on
                            specific points in passing, but the witch literature of the seventeenth
                            century is oppressively vast. Some of the Continental writers are
                            referred to in Scheltma's Heksenprocessen, others in Sprengel's
                            Geschichte der Arzneikunde; there is a list of English writers in the
                            Retrospective Review, v, and the late Justin Winsor printed a pamphlet
                            bibliography of American witchcraft. Francis Hutchinson's work is the
                            best on witchcraft generally. No subject within the scope of history can
                            be more dreary to the student of original authorities, more revolting to
                            humane feelings, or more disgusting in many of its details. Upham's
                            Salem Witchcraft, with an account of Salem village, is the only work on
                            the witches in Salem on which one can depend. It has no chapters and no
                            index worthy of the name, and is utterly exasperating, but it is a full
                            account of the witchcraft ordered and made clear. Upham did not know how
                            to make a book, he did not know the subtle laws of mind, but the
                            external facts are well given. I have had recourse to nearly all the
                            other data as well, from Cotton Mather and Calef down.</p>

                            Virginia was yet in its birth throes, William Harvey first expounded to
                            his students the circulation of the blood, which he published to the

                            question raised by Harvey. It is certainly improbable that anything new
                            in science ever came into possession of the barbers and bloodletters and

                            that the human body consisted of four elementsearth, air, fire, and
                            waterand that it contained just four humors or liquids corresponding
                            neatly in number with the four elements. These humors were bile or
                            choler, blood, melancholy or black bile, and phlegm. In the mystical
                            science of that time a mysterious relation or correspondence was
                            supposed to exist between each of the several elements and one of the
                            four humors. Anne Bradstreet, the beginner of New England poetry, sets
                            it forth in rhyme, that choler was the daughter of fire, blood of air,
                            melancholy of earth, and phlegm of water. Disease came from an excess of
                            one or another humor, or from a humor's being too cold <pb

                            notions. The words humor, temperament, bilious, choleric, atrabilious,
                            melancholy, phlegmatic, and others, are veritable fossils of the Galenic

                            the liver show the survival in folk-science of the old physiology that
                            gave supremacy to that organ, or of the theory of ancient medicine that
                            "the liver is made up from the roots of the veins" and that it was the

                            time was venesection. Hippocrates had used it with caution, thinking it
                            best in the spring time. Galen forbade bloodletting in the case of
                            persons under fourteen or over seventy years old. But in the seventeenth
                            century it was inflicted on men, women, and children for almost every
                            pathological offense. Louis XIII was bled forty-seven times in twelve
                            months. Infants of three days and men past eighty were thus depleted:
                            the "peccant" humors had to be expelled. Venesection was supposed to be
                            local in its effects and a vein was opened in the head for troubles in
                            the head. The French when depleting <pb id="VAA2405-064" n="53"/>

                            because he had studied in the Low Countries, and was acquainted with
                            chemistry. He <pb id="VAA2405-065" n="54"/> appears to have combined
                            Galenical with the chemical methods, and there were other eclectics at

                            scientific reasons. Whatever thought was reached by symbolism, or
                            uttered obscurely or mystically, impressed the susceptible imagination
                            of the age. The imagination then held the place of authority that
                            rightly belongs to the judgment. The later and elaborate doctrine of
                            signatures was a part of the prevalent philosophy of correspondences. It
                            was related to the influence of the planets on plants and minerals,
                            which influence was shown by color and other qualities and had to do
                            with medical properties. It was a part also of an obscure theory of

                            apparently by the magnet. It belonged to the overshadowing
                            supernaturalism of the time, <pb id="VAA2405-067" n="56"/> and to the
                            geocentric and homocentric notions of the universe that gave value to

                            indications of odor, color, form, and other marks. The resemblance was
                            often wholly external. "Like by like is to be curedthat is, similar
                            ulcers by similar forms," says Paracelsus. The porosity of the leaves of
                            St. John's-wort, and the spots which resembled perforations of the leaf,
                            left no doubt of the value of the plant in all cases of abrasion,
                            external or internal. The illusory appearance of holes in its leaves
                            showed it good for hallucinations, madness, and assaults of the devil.
                            This curious theory of medicine is to be detected in many of the
                            remedies prescribed in the colonies, and is yet more evident in the

                        <p>We may see the influence of the theory of signatures on English medicine
                            in actual transit to the colonies by examining a paper sent by Dr.
                            Stafford, of London, to Winthrop, Governor of Connecticut, the most
                            noted master of medicine in the early colonial period. In this paper are
                            remedies which must have been often prescribed in New England. Stafford
                            cured "madnesse" with St. John's-wort. "sometimes in five days."
                            Paracelsus had treated <pb id="VAA2405-068" n="57"/> the fibers of its
                            leaves as a signature, showing that this plant was good to drive away

                            present even in superstitions before the time of Paracelsus; the water
                            of St. John's-wort was used to drive away devils, and the herbs St.
                            John's-wort and rue were blessed after a prescribed form, wrapped in a

                            grieved." But our London doctor's masterpiece, as communicated to
                            Connecticut, appears to have been his "black powder" against smallpox
                            and other eruptive diseases. It was made of toads because toads were
                            believed to be poisonous, and all poison drew poison to itself, and thus
                            cured disease, as the author of the Triumphal Chariot of Antimony had
                            long before proved. This also was one mode of curing by the assimulate.
                            But the warts on the toad were perhaps regarded as a specific divine

                            characteristic of the medicine of the day he mixes a plaster not with
                            simple hog's lard, but with "barrow's grease." Subtlety of this sort

                            came into great notoriety in England in the middle of the seventeenth
                            century. This was the widely famous sympathetic powder made of vitriol
                            with much ceremonial precision. The powder stopped hemorrhages either
                            from disease or wounds. It was applied to the blood after it had issued
                            from the wound or to the blood-stained garment. Winthrop, of
                            Connecticut, imported the latest books on the subject of this powder,
                            which may well have come into use in a new country where surgical cases
                            were not infrequent. Before Winthrop's time, and after, German writers
                            on medicine attempted to give a scientific basis to the weapon ointment
                            and powder of sympathy by attributing their operation to magnetism, a
                            term that has covered more ignorance than any other ever invented. The

                            long-sought potable gold of the alchemists was yet in request; it even

                            virtue, and it was inferred that gold as the most precious metal would
                            be the most valuable remedy if it could be taken in liquid form. The
                            known use-fulness of mercurial remedies was attributed to the fact that
                            mercury was the densest of liquids. Gold was the densest metal then
                            known, and it <pb id="VAA2405-072" n="61"/> was easily decided, by the
                            process of using fancy to give fluidity to logic, that if it could be
                            reduced to drinkable consistency it would be the most valuable of
                                medicaments.<note id="note_196" place="right" anchored="yes">

                            time; the sun as chief luminary was "lord in the property" of gold.
                            "There is not found among things above or things beneath," says Glauber,
                            "a greater harmony and friendship than that between the sun, gold, man,

                            "therefore" potent enough to make gold a universal remedy for human
                            maladies, where the recovery was not "contrary to the unfathomable

                            styling "the lower Sun." Preparations professing to be potable gold and

                            debated. The alchemists held that three drops at the highest taken in

                            Hippocrates and Helmont." Doubtless many New-Englanders were dosed by

                            </note> Back through a long line of medical writers we may trace the
                            belief in the virtues of theriac and mithridate to Galen and into the
                            centuries before Galen. The accepted story of its origin is that
                            Mithridates, King of Pontus, by a series of experiments on criminals,
                            had found out, or thought he had found out, what medicaments would
                            neutralize various poisons. These he put together for a universal
                            antidote. Andromachus, physician to Nero, changed the constitution of
                            the remedy somewhat, adding the flesh of the viper, probably on the
                            principle of curing like by like. This remedy of Andromachus was the
                            famous theriac which was so much lauded by Galen and which imposed
                            itself even on modern times. It was expelled from the British
                            Pharmacopoeia only in the middle of the eighteenth century by a bare
                            majority of one vote in the college. It contained more than sixty
                            ingredients, and was commonly known in England as Venice treacle. Not
                            only all poisons but many diseases were supposed to be <pb

                            creature plunged into the water. On coming out it sought and ate of
                            health-giving herbs, and as a result the bezoar was concreted in its
                            vitals. The cost of the bezoar, the "queen of poisons," was great. "If
                            you take too much, your purse will soon complain," says a medical writer
                            in 1661. The concretions of the "mountain goat" were the original
                            bezoar, but any intestinal formation of the kind came to be considered
                            bezoar. In Java the viscera of the porcupine were eagerly searched for
                            such deposits, and one of these worthless things called a <hi rend="i"
                                >pedro porco</hi> was sold for the price of pearls. There were

                            those of the East; Mexico contributed a lower grade still. Finding these

                            rosin gathered on the bark was used for outward application; turpentine
                            procured by incisions was "excellent to heal wounds and cuts." Even
                            cosmetic applications were probably suggested in the same way; green
                            pine cones having a corrugated surface were good to remove wrinkles from
                            the face; water distilled from them was "laid on with cloths." The

                            Cambridge, Mass., from banishment for free speaking. There were in
                            Virginia a good many rough practitioners of one sort or another; in the
                            manuscript county record books of this early period they are called
                            "chirurgeons." The barber, who practiced minor surgery along with
                            shaving and hairdressing, was a natural outgrowth of the conditions
                            existing in the middle ages. But conditions had changed, and the barber
                            surgeon was in a fair way of extinction from unsuitableness to
                            environment when the colonies were settled. In 1638 a barber surgeon
                            lost his life journeying from Boston to Roxbury in a snowstorm to pull a
                            tooth. In a Virginia inventory of 1640 sixteen kinds of drugs are mixed
                            up with a hone, a razor, a lancet, and four other implements of a
                            surgical barber. In 1652 the surgeons of New Amsterdam petitioned for
                            the exclusive right to <pb id="VAA2405-086" n="75"/> shave. But a trade
                            profession so widely bifurcated could not survive the first generation
                            in a new country. The settler probably shaved himself in preference to
                            seeking a surgeon to do it, and the barber improved his social rank by
                            putting away his razor and hone and setting up in his medical capacity
                            only. As the higher ranks of the profession were mostly unoccupied, the
                            very word surgeon as a professional distinction disappeared from general
                            use in America. Every smatterer breveted himself physician to fill the
                            vacancy. The so-called bonesetters, of whom we hear very early in New
                            England, must have had predecessors in the mother country. Men with no
                            professional training and little education, they appear to have been
                            expert in the mere joiner work of surgery, as their title implies. The
                            art was often transmitted from father to son, and was sometimes believed
                            to be a natural and hereditary gift. In 1652 the Connecticut General
                            Court employed one of these men for the colony. This appointment of a
                            bonesetter-general indicates the rarity of surgeons in the country when
                            those of the first generation had disappeared. Six years later Boston
                            felt some alarm at the number of people resorting thither for "help in
                            physic and surgery," and took measures to prevent the town from becoming
                            responsible for the support of any of these patients. Clayton gives an
                            unflattering account of Virginia physicians in the latter part of the
                            century. They were, no doubt, like all the colonial medical men of the
                            time, mere <pb id="VAA2405-087" n="76"/> country-bred doctors, with the
                            training that could be got from an apprenticeship to the half-educated
                            surgeons, their predecessors.<note id="note_260" place="left"

                            centuries, and some of the clergy who came to America had a fair
                            acquaintance with the medical knowledge of the time. Robert Paulet, who
                            was sent to Virginia as a parson in 1619, appears to have been highly
                            esteemed as a physician; he refused a place in the governor's council
                            because he could not be spared by the people of his region. Many of the
                            ministers in New England practiced physic, some of them professionally,
                            others apparently gratuitously. There were few educated men in New

                            demons, and this part of her art was sometimes called "white

                        <p>Colonial medicine declined in character from the beginning. The
                            physicians of the second generation, like the magistrates and clergymen,
                            had much less education than those who came from England. Besides their
                            lack of general culture they had no proper training; the surgeon sent to
                            Massachusetts in 1629 was obligated to take one or more apprentices to
                            learn his art. This apprenticeship was probably all the teaching
                            received by the native practitioners of the seventeenth century and the
                            early eighteenth. It was <pb id="VAA2405-090" n="79"/> complained, in
                            1647, that medical students in Massachusetts were "forced to fall to
                            practice before ever they saw an Anatomy made." The doctors of America
                            could hardly have ranked with the most rustic chirurgeons in
                                England.<note id="note_275" place="right" anchored="yes">

                            </note> As the first generation of the American born came on the stage,
                            ignorant quacks and fanatics grew as rank as the English weeds that
                            flourished in the forest mold of a new continent. "We ought by all
                            means," says a Pennsylvania writer of 1684, "to discountenance all
                            Babylonical Letter-learned physitians both for the Soul and Body." The
                            medicine of the age was bad enough at its best; worse than the Greek
                            medicine whose traditions it revered and sometimes followed. The first
                            influence of the chemical school had been mainly bad; it was only later
                            that good results came from it. But the seventeenth century was none the
                            less a century of advance; in that age modern scientific medicine was
                            born. Harvey's discovery of the circulation of the blood is the starting
                            point, not only of modern medicine, but of experimental science as well.
                            His investigations on the subject of generation gave a philosophical
                            basis to comparative anatomy, and thus broadened the field of human
                            thought. In that century the skill of physicians first learned to cope
                            with malarial disease as a result of the introduction of cinchona, the
                            most important of all modern remedies. But the intellectual progress of
                            the time was a narrow current perceptible in the mid-channel of a wide
                                <pb id="VAA2405-091" n="80"/> and sluggish river whose shore reaches

                        <p>There were other curious notions about the humors. For example, a
                            physician, writing on Tunbridge water in 1670, speaks of phlegm as "the
                            private excrement of the brain at the mouth and nose." The opinion was
                            no doubt generally held on the authority of Galen's Medical Definitions,
                            in which the mucus from the nostrils is called "an excrement and
                            sediment of the brain." Par says phlegm is blood half concocted and is
                            fit to nourish the brain. English edition, p. 9.</p>
                        <p>This "numeral fetichism "may be plainly traced to Galen, and it is
                            evident also in the theory of the "critical days "in disease which
                            Hippocrates announced and which has been accepted in some form down
                            almost to this day. See, for example, Aphorisms of Hippocrates, section
                            ii, 24; iv, 59, 61, 64; and Adams's references to Galen on these in his
                            edition. Sir Conrad Sprengell's comment on the former of these, in his
                            English translation of the Aphorisms in 1735, shows the vitality of the
                            notion at a late date. Conrad Sprengell reduces the days to periods, and
                            he hesitates to accept the dictum of Hippocrates, that fevers are apt to
                            return unless they leave the patient on odd days. Compare the short work
                            that Kurt Sprengel, at a later day, makes of this very aphorism in his

                            Les Mdecins au Temps de Molire, 180, note. In 1580 Juan Huarte, a
                            Spanish physician, published Examen de Ingenios para las Sciencias, a
                            work of great popularity which was rendered into many tongues. The
                            English version appeared in 1616 under the title A Triall of Wits.
                            Huarte tried to do what modern phrenology has attemptedto indicate the
                            aptitude of men for different occupations. In chaps. v and vi he
                            explains that all the difference in the character of men's minds is
                            traceable to heat, dryness, and humidity. Dryness is favorable to
                            understanding, heat to imagination, while moisture is essential to
                            memory, which is therefore strongest in the morning.</p>

                            the following remedies are mentioned as familiar cathartics and

                            antimony, mechoacan, rhubarb, senna, wormwood, myrobalanes, peach-tree
                            bark, medicines of mercury, salt, oxymel, and pepper. Except mechoacan,
                            peach-tree bark, and perhaps wormwood, all these remedies were known to
                            the Arabians, and all the rest except senna, myrobalanes, and oxymel
                            were, I believe, included in the ancient Greek materia medica. Compare

                            by an anti-Galenist in Thomson on the Plague, 1666, pp. 50 and 51.
                            Venesection was not nearly so common in England as in France. In the
                            Historical MSS. Commission, Eleventh Report, Appendix, part v, p. 7, is
                            a letter from Prince Rupert: "I am in noe small paine for our cosin

                        <p>That the doctrine of signatures is more ancient than Paracelsus I have no
                            doubt. The treatise De Dynamdiis, usually enumerated among the works of
                            Galen, and sometimes ascribed to Gariopontus, of the famous medical
                            school of Salerno (a professed compiler from Galen), deduces the
                            therapeutic virtue of substances form color, form, or other
                            characteristics. uvres de Ambroise Par, Introduction par Malgaigne, xxi.
                            Compare also Henderson's School of Salernum, ii. But the editor of
                            Sydenham Society's edition of Paulus gineta has in part anticipated this
                            remark, for he says that he has "detected a few traces of the singular
                            doctrine of signatures, so-called, in the works of ancient authorities,"
                            iii, 16. Major J. W. Powell, Director of the Bureau of Ethnology of the
                            Smithsonian Institution, tells me that the doctrine of curing by likes
                            is a part of the medical theory of every tribe of American Indians, as
                            it is very curiously of Chinese medicine. The conclusion is not a
                            violent one that it is an element of primitive medicine generally. It
                            was elaborated into an element of philosophy in the later middle ages.
                            Basilius Valentinus, <pb id="VAA2405-094" n="83"/> whose Triumph Wagen
                            Antimonii, written about 1500 A. D., appears to have furnished
                            Paracelsus with many germs of theory, pretends that a spider being
                            poisonous can not get away if surrounded by a circle of unicorn's horn
                            which was an ideal antidote to poison. But if any poisonous substance
                            were added to the circle, the spell was broken and the spider escaped.
                            Bread, on the other hand, was strongly attracted by unicorn's horn, both
                            being free from poison, pp. 66 and 67, original edition, 1624. His
                            general principle is stated mystically" Simile simili gaudet."
                            Paracelsus probably derives from this his dictum "of likes with likes,
                            not contraries against contraries "("Ex qua recepta sibi proponuntur
                            similium cum similibus non contrariorum ad contraria "), and he adds,
                            "Salt therefore wishes to have its Salt, Mercury its Mercury, and
                            Sulphur its Sulphur "salt, mercury, and sulphur being the three
                            principal elements in mystic philosophy. Paracelsus, De Cutis
                            Apertionibus, chap, vii, p. 62. Compare Otto Tachenius, His Clavis, p.
                            2, and see the doctrine of the sympathy of similars stated with a
                            ludicrous mimicry of logic by a learned Galenist, Maranta, in his De
                            Theriaca, liber i, caput iii (1576). Adams, in his edition of the works
                            of Hippocrates, i, 75 ff., on the treatise anciently ascribed to
                            Hippocrates and belonging to his period, On the Places in Man, says:
                            "And he further makes the important remark that, although the general
                            rule of treatment be 'contraria contrariis curantur,' the opposite rule
                            also holds good in some cases, namely, 'Similia similibus curantur.'"
                            Basilius Valentinus, p. 68, recognizes both methods as though this
                            passage were before him, and Paracelsus appears to be denying the first
                            half of it in the extract given above. It is not possible to separate
                            this doctrine of curing by likes from the doctrine of signatures with
                            which it was entangled. One of the best statements of this is to be
                            found in the Magia Natural o Ciencia de Filosofia Secreta, a very
                            intelligent work by Castrillo, a Spanish Jesuit, which bears date 1649.
                            He says that many "modern philosophers " have pretended to find in
                            external forms indications of the occult qualities of things. Plants
                            that show any resemblance to the human head are good for cephalic
                            troubles, as are animals whose heads are remarkable in shape, such as
                            the elephant, the beaver, and others. Animals with eyes notable in any
                            way are remedies for the ills of that organ, and he instances among
                            others the turtle that in dying was believed to shut one eye and open
                            the other, and mentions a stone that showed a pupil within a circle
                            which rendered the vision acute if held in <pb id="VAA2405-095" n="84"/>

                            </note> There seems to be a trace of this mode of thinking in the
                            ancient legend of Telephus, which has served so many poets, including
                            Dante and Chaucer, and which gave anciently the name "telephean" to
                            incurable ulcers. Wounded by Achilles, Telephus could be healed only by
                            rust from the spear that inflicted the injury. A suggestion of the same
                            feeling among the Semitic nations is perhaps to be found in the brazen
                            serpent of Moses, and in the offering of the Philistines, 1 Samuel, vi.</p>
                        <p>From the English version of Jacob Behmen's De Signatura Rerum I quote the
                            following: "Every root as it is in the Earth may be known by the
                            signature for what it is good and profitable, and it is discerned in the
                            leaves and stalk which Planet is Lord in the Property, much more in the
                            Flower: for of what taste the Herb and Root is, even such an Hunger is
                            in it, and such a cure lies therein, for it has such a Salt." Compare
                            the term sulphur applied to rosin: "welchs des Baums Sulphur ist."

                            science at the end of the middle ages. "Medicine," says Paracelsus, "is
                            not otherwise a science than this that the will of God may be secret and
                            secret may be the will of God." De Naturalibus Rebus, chap. v. Among the
                            manuscripts in my collection is a very clever alchemical Poeme Sur
                            l'elixir Royal in a handwriting of the late seventeenth century. In
                            this, Nature, exhorting the poet to speak of the forces by which Heaven
                            has extracted light from metals, enjoins him to speak esoterically "like
                            a philosopher":</p>

                            given in Paracelsus, who no doubt found it in Basil Valentine, who

                            has the prescription given by Paracelsus to the Emperor Maximilian, and
                            received through a courtier by Porta. I give it in English: Two ounces
                            of skull moss, as above; of human flesh, the same; of mummy (a liquor
                            reported to be distilled from dead bodies) and of human blood, each half
                            an ounce; of linseed oil, turpentine, and Armenian bole, each one

                            diseases, according to Sprengel. Compare Sir K. Digby on the cure of

                            by the strict Galenists. The subject was discussed before the Royal

                            He denounced the weapon ointment as imposture. "Neither if any should

                            his illness by Lorrayne, a physician of the famous faculty of
                            Montpellier, and another. "They gave him Confectio Alcarmas compounded
                            of musk, amber, gold, pearl, and unicorn's horn," ingredients whose
                            virtues seem to have been deduced from their rarity and costliness. The
                            confectio alkermes, an Arabic remedy, varied in its ingredients. The
                            amber was ambergris. See the formula in the Amsterdam Pharmacopia of
                            1636, p. 61, and that in the London Dispensatory as quoted and <pb

                            Library, 1675. The Arabic form of the confection appears to have been
                            less complicated. In the well-known pharmaceutical work of Mesue the
                            youngerJohn son of Mesue, son of Mech, son of Hely, son of Abdella, King
                            of Damascusthe ingredients in this "confectione alkermes" are fewer, and
                            there are no pearls or ambergris. The costly elements are "good gold,"
                            "good musk," and lapis lazuli. My copy of this work is called Mesue
                            Vulgare, perhaps because it is in Italian. It bears date Venice, 1493,
                            and must have been one of the earliest of printed medical works. See K.
                            Sprengel, vol. ii, 361-364, on Mesue the younger. On the tendency to
                            expensive remedies, compare Howell's Familiar Letters, 45. "More

                            me, but, after some wearying of the mind with esoteric phrases in a
                            compound of old German and Latin, I prefer to leave the question of the
                            actual constitution of the most potent universal remedy to special
                            investigators. Fons-sagrives, in the Dictionnaire Encyclopdique des
                            Sciences Mdicales, under the word "Or,"says that a preparation of
                            mercury and chloride of gold constituted the so-called potable gold of
                            the seventeenth centuryI do not know on what authority. I am in some
                            doubt whether, after all the complicated hugger-mugger, the alchemists
                            got any gold in their final decoctions. According to Phaedro, it was not
                            so much gold they sought as the subtile spirit of gold that freed men
                            and metals from impurities. Glauber, in his De Auri Tinctura, 1652, took
                            pains to explain how the true could be known from the false and
                            sophisticated potable gold, some of which was nothing but colored water,
                            p. 24. Angelus Sala, though of the Paracelsian school, ridiculed the
                            notion of drinkable gold, and declared that fulminating gold
                            (knall-gold) was the only preparation of that metal that had ever been
                            made. Sprengel, Geschichte der Arzneikunde, iv, 557. It has been
                            conjectured that some of the so-called potable gold offered for sale was
                            merely a preparation of mercury. The two metals were allied, in the
                            fancy of the time. In the Ehralter Ritterkrieg Gold calls Mercury "Mein
                            Bruder Mercuric," and yet says that mercury was the female and gold the
                            male. Salmon's English Physician, p. 10, has two recipes for making
                            tincture of gold, one <pb id="VAA2405-100" n="89"/> with, the other

                            if adorned with "stones and lovely gems," recreated the eyes and heart,
                            and a man might be brought to himself when in a collapse by applying

                        <p>The library of Winthrop the younger consisted of more than a thousand
                            volumes. The fraction of it now in the Society Library in New York is
                            less than half. Among these is Hercules Chymicus sive Aurum Potabile,
                            1641, and Traicte de la Vraye Unique Grand et Universelle Mdecine des
                            Anciens, dite des Recens, Or Potabile, 1633. There was also Glauber's
                            Latin Treatise of 1658 on Potable Gold. These were new books. The
                            revival of interest in potable gold in the seventeenth century awakened
                            opposition. Burton, in his Anatomy of Melancholy, says: "Some take it
                            upon them to cure all maladies by one medicine severally applyed, as
                            that Panacea, Aurum potabile, so much controverted in these days." In
                            1403 an English statute had been passed making it felony to "use any
                            craft of multiplication" to increase the quantity of gold and silver.
                            Statutes at Large, ii, 448. Robert Boyle, in the seventeenth century, in
                            spite of his having written The Sceptical Chemist, thought he had
                            discovered the forgotten secret of the fifteenth century, but he did not
                            print his discovery. Sir Isaac Newton wrote to the Royal Society in
                            praise of Boyle's reticence, fearing that the full disclosure of what
                            the hermetics knew was "not to be communicated without immense damage to
                            the world" In 1689, however, Boyle secured the repeal of the statute
                            forbidding the making of gold. Thus did the dark <pb id="VAA2405-101"

                            discussion in Castrillo's Magia Natural, last chapter. Castrillo calls
                            the bezoar "Regna de los Venenos," and says that it cured pestiferous
                            fevers and other diseases caused by melancholy humors. Joannes Juvenis,
                            in his essay De Medicamentis Bezoardicis, published in Antwerp in the
                            latter part of the sixteenth century, treats the bezoar very mystically.
                            A disease of an occult and divine origindivinus et Secretus morbuslike
                            the plague, exacts a medicine of a heavenly and concealed faculty, and,
                            as he said, with a blind and hidden potency. The plague, he says, "is a
                            mysterious disease of the heart caught by inhalation from poison
                            dispersed in the air by a malign conjunction of the planets." It
                            requires a bezoardic remedy. Under this head he includes alexipharmical
                            mixtures and remedies whose supposed virtues have no rational basis, as
                            well as amulets. He describes an amulet of gold, silver, and arsenic
                            made into the shape of a heart and worn next that organ by Pope Adrian,
                            and he recommends the wearing of six precious stones and some briliant
                            pearls in finger rings or about the neck. They are to be requently
                            looked on, for in them resides "the hidden bezoar" against all poisons
                            and the plague. There is here the sense of alexipharmical in the word
                            bezoar. Compare the citations of Adams in Paulus gineta, iii, 247.

                            were literally crushed to death in the mad eagerness of the crowd to
                            secure the blessing of the royal touch. Evelyn's Diary, 571. It is
                            remarked by Aubrey with his wonted innocency that "whether our kings
                            were of the house of York or Lancaster" the touch "did the cure (i. e.)
                            for the most part." Worse than all, in the time of Monmouth's rebellion,
                            the illegitimate touch of the pretender cured some of his believing
                            partisans. Castrillo, the Spanish Jesuit, declared in 1649 that the
                            intercessions of Joseph of Arimathea, the first missionary to England,
                            had secured to its monarchs "el cura de la gota." The Spanish kings, on
                            the other hand, had the gift of exorcism. "Los reges de Espaa tienen
                            gracia de ahuyentor demonios por auer sus antecessores professado la
                            propagacion de la F," etc. Magia Natural, folio 81. The miraculous touch
                            of the English kings was believed to date from the Confessor. The touch
                            of a seventh son"a seventh son and no daughter between, and in pure
                            wedlock"was almost as good as the king's perhaps. Aubrey's Miscellanies,
                            fourth edition, 124, 125. Seventh sons were to be reached in America
                            sometimes. Faith in the virtue of their touch is not yet quite extinct
                            in America or in England. Compare Diary of Walter Yonge, 13, note. In
                            1688 a man afflicted with ulcers petitioned the Governor of
                            Massachusetts to give him a brief to solicit money in Massachusetts to
                            defray the expense of a trip to England to crave the royal touch.

                            utilitatibus. Culpepper's Commentary on the London Dispensatory, 1675,
                            contains lists of these animal substances in undisguised English. Cotton
                            Mather said of Wait Winthrop, the third of the family to practice
                            medicine on his neighbors, that he turned nearly all Nature to medicine:</p>

                            describes the Indian method of curing wounds by sucking them and then
                            using the mouth as a syringe to inject a biting decoction. Instead of
                            cupping, the savages cauterized with lighted punk.</p>
                        <p>The practice of surgeons was not held in high esteem in England in the
                            sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. John Halle, in the preface to
                            Lanfranke's Chirurgerie, 1565, says: "Whereas there is one Chirurgien
                            that was apprentice to his arte, or one phisicien that hath trauayled in
                            the true Studie and Exercise of Phisique, there are tenne that are

                            ff., decrees and ordinances for the regulation of barber-surgeons in the
                            middle ages, with an account of the struggle of the surgeons to abase
                            the barbers. In England matters had come to such a pass in the sixteenth
                            century that Sir H. Gilbert, in his Queen Elizabeth's Achademy, says
                            that "Chirurgie is not now to be learned in any other place then in a
                            Barbors Shoppe." To the practice of barbers, and surgeons little better,
                            the colonists were usually shut up by circumstances. One early Virginia
                            surgeon was a Dutch bond servant. A library consisting of The Surgeon's
                            Mate or of Barrough's Method of Phisicke, rarely of several books, gave
                            the suffering what comfort can be had from quackery that is self-reliant
                            from mere ignorance.</p>
                        <p>Crocus Metallorum, the favorite Virginia remedy, was an officinal
                            preparation used in several formul by Sydenham at that time. The editor
                            of the works of Sydenham (Sydenham Opera Omnia, 1844) makes it
                            "Antimonii Sesquioxyd cum Antimon. Sequisulphur." It was emetic. See
                            Sydenham's Epistle I, works in English, ii, 19. It was prepared
                            according to the London Dispensatory by calcining together equal parts
                            of antimony and saltpeter. On the use of sulphuret of antimony by the
                            Jews, Greeks, Romans, and Arabs, see an interesting note in Adams's
                            Paulus gineta, iii, 356. The curious reader may also consult Basil
                            Valentine, p. 37, who makes antimony "one of the seven wonders of the
                            world." The tract Von den Particular Vnd Vniversal-Tincturen, appended
                            to the Triumph Wagen, Thlden's issue, 1624, contains a section "De
                            Crocis Metallorum, et eorum Salibus," written in alchemical style.
                            Venice treacle was the world-famed theriac, which, according to the
                            English formula, contained about sixty-five ingredients, and was given
                            as a universal antidote. Gascoin's powder was the compound powder of
                            calcined crab's claws, so called. I do not know what it was, but not
                            literal crab's claws. Snakeroot is the only American remedy in the list,
                            and this had been accepted in Europe. Evidently the Virginia doctors
                            were old-fashioned, and, according to their slender knowledge, Galenist.
                            Medicines of the other school and simples were perhaps used in domestic
                            and irregular practice.</p>

                            as a womanly accomplishment, ibid., 238. The sense of its
                            appropriateness to women, and the habit of prescription by accomplished
                            women, survived in the seventeenth century and later. Clayton said of
                            the Indians in 1687, "Every one according to his skill is a doctor (as
                            some women are in England)." Transactions of the Royal Society, xli,
                            143. Tiraboschi, in his Storia della Litteratura Italiana, iii, lib. iv,
                            sect. ii, cites from Odericus Vitalis a passage implying that the most
                            skillful physician in the world-famous school of Salerno in 1059 was a
                            woman. Of Rodolfo he says: "Nella medecina ancora egli era cosi versato,
                            the in Salerno non si trovo chi es uqualiasse fuor di una dotta
                            matrons." This is supposed to refer to Trotula, some of whose writings
                            have come down to our time. The wording of the decree of 1281 cited in
                            Astruc's Histoire de la Facult de Mdecine de Montpellier, p. 20, is
                            considered by Malgaigne to imply the habitual practice of medicine by
                            women in the middle ages. In this decree Jacques "defend toutes
                            personnes tant aux Chrtiens qu'aux Juifs," to practice without degrees.
                            Compare Malgaigne's inference from this in his preface to uvres
                            d'Ambroise Par, but Malgaigne's reference to Astruc and his date are
                            both slightly inaccurate. On the women professors of the school of
                            Salerno, Henderson's pamphlet on that school and Ordronneaux's Code of
                            Health of Salerno. As late as 1691 Cotton Mather, in "Ornaments for the
                            Daughters of Zion," mentions "chirurgery" as an appropriate study for
                            women. It is said that in colonial New Jersey women engrossed a
                            considerable share of the medical art, such as it was. This is no doubt
                            true of all the colonies.</p>

                            miles of London "and not much above." There were gentlemen in all the
                            shires that could "speak good Southerne," but most of the gentlemen and

                            state of flux. This gave an advantage to the writer of first-rate power;

                            have acquired something from the sea ventures of the time to Turkey and
                            Russia and the Spanish main. "Secretaries Marchaunts and trauailours"
                            were already introducing alien words, but England possessed little
                            foreign commerce and did not yet promise to take rank as a sea power.
                            The sudden demand upon this close-cabined island speech in the
                            seventeenth century for means to represent the endless objects, actions,
                            and experiences of the New World and of a widening commerce was one of
                            the most efficient forces for developing modern English.</p>

                            </note> In the wilderness of America English speech was a misfit; an
                            Indian chief, however squalid and beggarly, was forthwith translated
                            into a king; the stark-naked little squaw child Pocahontas, turning
                            herself into a wheel in imitation of the boys with whom she played at
                            Jamestown, bore in English the incongruous title of princess. We hear of
                            an "Indian king" in New Jersey who was hired to carry a traveler's
                            baggage; and after encountering many scrubby royalties, it is a relief
                            to find in New England one chief who was only a duke. The early adoption
                            into colonial speech of the discriminating Indian titleswerowance,
                            sachem, saga-more, and cockerouseand the application at last of the
                            generic English word chief, helped to dissipate a swarm of erroneous
                            notions. More specific terms were the result of fuller knowledge; the
                            compound bark house in which an "emperor," like Powhatan, dwelt as
                            co-tenant with numerous families of his wife's totem, ceased to be a
                            palace and became a wigwam. It was thus that English by degrees adjusted
                            itself to a new environment.</p>

                        <p>In popular thought at the period of American settlement every place
                            beyond the countries of Europe was a region of outer darkness dominated
                            by devils who were worshiped as deities. The typical infidel was the
                            Turk, the ancient foe of Christendom; an idol was therefore called a
                            mawmet, that is to say, a Mahomet, from a notion that the Arabian
                            prophet was a false god. It may have been from this general confounding
                            of all the world that lay without Christendom that some plants and
                            animals from the New World easily got the name of Turkey or Turkish
                            attached to them. The fowl we call by that name was in French a <hi

                        <p>Indian corn became the staple food product of the colonists, and English
                            was put to all its makeshifts to find names for its parts and products
                            and the novel processes attending its culture and uses. Stalk, blade,
                            and ear were easily transferred from other sorts of corn, but for the
                            blossoms the words silk and tassel were felicitous tropes. The envelope
                            of the ear gave trouble. Megapolensis, an early Dutch writer, calls the
                            husks "leaves" Strachey, in speaking of "a kind of wheat" which the
                            Indians call "poketawes," describes the ears as growing each "with a
                            great hose or pill about it." The Virginians applied an English dialect
                            word, "shuck," to the "hose" about the ear, the New England colonist
                            adopted husk, and in the extreme South the infelicitous phrase "corn
                            trash" came into use, and all three are still living. Husk, which in New
                            England expressed the outer covering of the ear, was in the middle and
                            in some southern regions quite as fittingly given to the bran, the
                            covering of the grain, while in certain regions of Virginia the same
                            word, usually pronounced <pb id="VAA2405-116" n="105"/> "huss," meant
                            the cob on which the grains grew; nor is this use yet obsolete.<note

                            speech between two adjacent communities. John Lyon Gardiner recorded, in
                            1798, that on Long Island an Easthampton man might be known from a
                            Southampton man "as well as a native of Kent may be distinguished from a
                            Yorkshire man." The two towns adjoin and the two communities had been
                            living side by side for more than a hundred and fifty years when this
                            wide difference of speech was found still persisting. In Dorchester,
                            Massachusetts, the land measures retained a local English trait; one
                            finds the old Dorsetshire measure of a goad in the early records. In

                            </note> But the English origin of our rustic words and accents is
                            generally evident. For example, the twang longest associated with
                            America by dialect writers is the distortion of certain words
                            imperfectly represented in the spelling of heouse, teown, and keow, for
                            house, town, and cow. Franklin long ago set down in Poor Richard's
                            Almanac his observation that the residents of Connecticut and Cape May
                            called a cow a keow "by a certain involuntary twist at the root of the
                            tongue." This crescendo vowel is the recognized tag of the burlesque
                            Yankee of the stage and comic literature. Its feline drawl may yet be
                            caught in a state of nature in some of the mountain districts of New
                            England, but it also exists far to the southward. There are London small
                            shopkeepers who, along with a mock Latin "dies" for days, have an
                            unmistakable mew in "heouse" and "teown" and "abeout." There is nothing
                            in English dialect more evidently ancient, for it was a trait of the
                            archaic patois of a portion of County Wexford, in Ireland, which was
                            settled by a colony of English people who crossed St. George's Channel
                            in the middle ages under Strongbow, full two hundred years before
                            Chaucer's Canterbury Tales were written. These medival emigrants took
                            out of England with them in A. D. 1169 and a little later such Yankee
                            forms as "greoune" for ground, "pleough" for plow, and "teown" for town.

                            calls a fraction of a wagon load a jag. The word was colonial; in a
                            diary of 1763 a New England parson takes pains to set down among the
                            small doings of his farm that he had "gott in 2 jaggs of Rowens." This
                            and other bits of American dialect can be explained only by going to the
                            mother country. In Yorkshire some primitive modes of transportation
                            still survive. The pack horse that climbs the steep moor side laden with
                            coals for the limekilns in the mountains that overlook the Dale of the
                            Wharfe is known as the jagging horse and the burden under which he reels
                            is a jag. The American settlers used the jagging or pack horse on narrow
                            forest trails throughout the colonial period. When wheels in summer and
                            sleds in winter took the place of packing or "jagging," a small load of
                            hay or wheat or rowen, suitable for a horse's back or to be drawn by a
                            single horse, was still called a jag.</p>

                            </note> Now and then an African word survived for a while. There was
                            "quaqua," an instrument of music or of noise, but the word and the thing
                            went down together. Buckra, a name for the white man on the African
                            coast, reappeared in the West Indies and in the Carolinas. Perhaps the
                            only old negro word surviving now is "juba," to which no definable sense
                            attaches. The negro "hit" was court English in Elizabeth's time; the
                            supposed negro words "den," "dey," "dat," for them, they, that, appear
                            in verses written in the modern dialect of Surrey. African speech has
                            left hardly a trace even upon dialect in the United States. Slave speech
                            caught its first accents from the bond servants and convicts who worked
                            alongside the negro and from illiterate overseers. It probably preserved
                            much that was worst in the English of the seventeenth century.</p>

                            distinctive term; hence the frequent recurrence of the words "hired
                            servant." When negro slaves were added in large numbers to the servile
                            class, the name of servant was naturally rendered more odious by English
                            race pride and Christian detestation of the heathen. As early as 1651
                            the phrase "any servant or other helpe in the family" occurs in the
                            Massachusetts Records. "Hired man," "hand," and "hired girl" have come
                            into use later from the same disposition to avoid the word servant. This
                            dislike, which seems to have been half latent in the colonies, was
                            greatly helped perhaps by that strange and widespread irruption of
                            democratic sentiment which occurred in the later colonial and
                            Revolutionary times. The distinction between a "Goodman" and a "Mr." or
                            gentleman had not disappeared in the seventeenth century; it was in
                            general use at Salem in the time of the witchcraft.</p>

                            shoulders to hang his pack upon. Lord Hunsdon writes to Cecil in 1596
                            that "beggars may be no chusers," and two years later he remarks that a
                            "burnt child dreads the fire." "Down with his dust" in the modern sense
                            is used by Fuller, the quaint church historian. When the birth of a
                            young prince who became Louis XIV took the world by surprise twenty
                            years after the marriage of his parents, an English letter writer
                            alluded to the overthrow of the hopes of the displaced heir by saying,
                            "Monsieurs cake is dough." "Thereby lies a tale" is older than
                            Shakespeare, who gave the phrase a punning form. In a simple life with
                            little literature sententious <pb id="VAA2405-126" n="115"/> proverbs
                            abound, and the English of the period of settlement had many more of
                            such allusions than have survived. An Cotton, in her account of Bacon's
                            rebellion in Virginia, compares the soldiers besieging a camp from which
                            Indians had already escaped to Scoggin's wife "brooding the eggs which
                            the fox had sucked," an allusion to a "merry song" of that time. "Fair
                            play from foule gamesters" is another of her phrases. When she says that
                            certain events put Bacon "and those with him shrodly to their trumps
                            believing that a few such deals or shufles. might quickly ring both

                            popular phrases in primitive forms. "Like the corn, light between the
                            stones which might grind him to powder," reminds one of the current
                            phrase "between the upper and the nether millstone." Resolving with the

                            wrote in the racy colonial English. Almost all our most current
                            proverbial philosophy has come down to us from the period when people
                            liked to shape their thoughts into epigrams, and lacking light
                            literature were fain to spice their speech with quaint allusions.
                            Proverbs abounded for other reasons in communities where utterance was
                            trammeled and phrases with quaint outshinings were sent from man to man
                            to carry denunciation in enigmas. "No bullets can pierce beaver <pb

                            the murdering Indians lest the fur trade from which he levied an

                            neighbor. Such proverbs do not become folk-lore, they express political
                            passion smothered but ready to burst into flame. There is another sort
                            of readymade traditional speech that is neither proverb nor politics.
                            Friday was of old a marked day among the credulous vulgar as it is now,
                            but the ancient notion had to do with weather. They called it either
                            king or worling (worlding) "bicause it is either the fairest or foulest
                            of the seauen." "Oisters," says Harrison, in 1577, "are generallie
                            foreborne in the foure hot moneths of the yeare,which are void of the
                            letter R." This rule for oysters must have been much older and prevalent
                            beyond England. The Dutch over their tankards had a humorous variant of
                            it, to the effect that water was to be taken only in months without an
                            r. The familiar mnemonic jingle that begins with "thirty days hath

                            needed excitement in the long wintry evenings. Ballads of love and
                            bloody ballads of slaughter were sung while the flicker of failing
                            firelight on the wide hearth peopled the remote corners of the room with
                            grotesque shadows in motion. Chevy Chase and other ballads, the heritage
                            of the English generations, were chanted to young people, keeping alive
                            British tradition and feeling in the American woods. The merry
                            mirth-provoking old English songs of primitive humor reappear in
                            Virginia. One of these, the Song of Scoggin, is preserved to us by title
                            only in a proscription of it by the eminent and godly Mr. Perkins. As
                            the ideas and feelings embodied in the old unwritten ballads brought
                            over the sea grew dim and remote, these same ballads absorbed by
                            degrees, and with no more change than was necessary, a flavor of
                            America. The highly interesting Scottish-English ballad of Young
                            Beichan, or Lord Bateman, for example, the versions of which in Great
                            Britain are many, became American when repeated by generations who had
                            forgotten the crusades. Susan Pye, the Saracen girl, became Suky Fry, an
                            American, who, having cared for an English nobleman in prison, goes to
                            England to have the same incredible adventure that befalls the heroine
                            of the older <pb id="VAA2405-131" n="120"/> ballad, and she wears the
                            same jewels and is described in almost the same lines. Other ballads and
                            songs, manifestly of English origin, were current with slight changes in
                            the older States until recent times. But American events sometimes gave
                            birth to American rhymes: Bacon's rebellion was versified in Virginia,
                            and Lovewell's gallant but disastrous fight in Maine gave rise to a gory
                            ballad that put Chevy Chase out of countenance, and became "the most
                            beloved of all" in New England. Very curious and perhaps very antique
                            forms of English folk-tales were brought to America. For example, there
                            was in New England a version of the world-old tale of Cinderella known
                            as Rose, Pink, and Piney (or Peony), a version apparently unknown to
                            collectors of English folklore, and yet other traditional tales were
                            long preserved in ancient forms that have been lost in the mother

                            little literature in the strict sense of the word. Theology dominated in
                            every collection. If George Sandys, the traveler and poet, consoled his
                            lonely hours in Virginia with a few books of English literature we have
                            no record of it, but he brought with him a copy of "the sweet-tong'd
                            Ovid," which he rendered into English verse in Jamestown "by that
                            imperfect light which was snatcht from the hours of night and repose,"
                            while the unhappy colony of which he was an officer was agitated by the
                            alarms of Indian war and pestilence. Most of the books read in the
                            colonies were far removed from the" never-discontinued rhymes" of Ovid.

                            books of the practice of piety, 3 books of the playne man's pathway,"
                            and "halfe a reme of paper." Bishop Bayly's "Practice of Piety directing
                            a Christian how to walke that he may please God" is at once half medival
                            and wholly Puritan in tone. Its popularity and its almost divine
                            authority with the men of that age is a remarkable literary phenomenon.
                            It turns up in almost every Virginia probate inventory, and is found far
                            into the eighteenth century, often associated with its running mate,
                            Dent's "Plaine Man's Pathway to Heaven wherein every man may clearly see
                            whether he shall be saved or damned." At the urgent request of the
                            eminent Robert Boyle, the Practice of Piety was translated into the
                            Indian tongue of Massachusetts. In a Virginia library of five volumes,
                            in 1648, the inevitable Practice of Piety has for companions "Mr.

                            that gave their owners an air of general information, and it is only in

                            educated Virginians such masterpieces of real literature as Ralegh's

                            "Michael, Lord Montague," and the Religio Medici. In an inventory of

                            of the almost imminent final catastrophe, and edition after edition was
                            sold. Only ten years before the outbreak of the American Revolution a
                            Boston paper could speak of Michael Wigglesworth's "divine poems."
                            Versification was an unreproved amusement in all the colonies, but most
                            of the wooden rhymes of the time rested in manuscript. In New England
                            the habitual use of the printing press gave opportunity for prolific
                            facility to win something like distinction. Benjamin Tompson was a later
                            and less lugubrious writer than Wigglesworth, and he achieved fame
                            enough to have it graven on his tombstone that he was the "renowned poet

                        <p>The age was partly responsible. If there had been any love of Nature in
                            the seventeenth century, American settlers would have shown some
                            appreciation of its aspects in a new world. But the prevailing sentiment
                            of the time was that Nature had long been steadily deteriorating, and
                            that the everlasting frame of the universe was in a state of rack and
                            decay. For the sublime in external Nature there was no taste. An
                            accomplished English traveler in 1621 describes the "hideous" Alps,
                            which he had crossed, as "uncouth, huge, monstrous excrescences of
                            Nature." This, we may suppose, represents the sentiment of English
                            settlers toward the grand primeval wilderness about them. "Uncouth" is
                            Captain John Smith's only epithet for the picturesque wilderness trails
                            through which he marched; and George Sandys, though a poet, never seems
                            to look upon the wilderness except as an obstruction and an enemy. The
                            colonial verse writer does not suffer any intrusion into his mediations
                            of the over-awing effects of Nature, primitive and unsubdued, as he
                            encountered it. What <pb id="VAA2405-138" n="127"/> contemplation there
                            is in the books and letters at the time expends itself' on the

                            character of the people otherwise than by contemplation. They grew up in
                            the earlier generations woodsmen. Distinctively English characteristics
                            fell away from them. The exigencies of a new country made them
                            quickwitted and shifty. The dignity and repose of bearing that belong to
                            a fixed position in an older civilization were lost, for the time at
                            least. The American was pushing, aggressive, inquisitive. He was also
                            more open-minded than his ancestors; a change of circumstances broke up
                            the conservative crust of centuries of English life. The "go" of a new
                            country came into the new life and a hundred years after the early
                            settlement of the colonies an English clergyman in Virginia sketches the
                            American as we have known himnimble-witted, but less patient and

                            and then it was gilded and richly tooled. Then there were small quartos
                            thick and small quartos thin, some bound and tooled, but many stitched
                            and homebound by the owner in parchment sewed through and through by
                            strings of sheepskin or clad in scraps of old missals or merely covered

                            various and often too nondescript to be set down, running all the way to
                            twenty-fourmos or something of the sort. Regularity in size or shape was
                            not important in libraries that usually were not shelved but stored in
                            chests. If there were Latin works, there would be many in parchment
                            cover, or if from the Rhine country some would be elaborately stamped in
                            pigskin and held together by ockumy clasps. A few manuscripts one would
                            be pretty sure to finda diary or a journal of travel, or a controversial
                            tract, or some poems innocent of print. From college the owner brought
                            in his own handwriting a carefully copied digest of logic, metaphysics,
                            divinity, with arithmetic, or geometry. He may have added some rules and
                            diagrams for land surveying. Many of the manuscripts were transcripts of
                            printed books not easily come by in those days. Some professional men of
                            the time saved money and learned their texts by transcribing from books
                            borrowed from others; and lawyers bound later laws in manuscript in the

                            of the English Language." All changes of usage were accounted
                            corruptions, and stay-at-home men have grieved for three centuries over
                            the "corruptions" introduced into the tongue from the various offshoots
                            of the mother country.</p>
                        <p>The word "turkish" had perhaps come to signify "foreign"or "outlandish"
                            in European tongues. It is to be noted that a third German name for the
                            turkey was <hi rend="i">wlsches huhn,</hi> the foreign fowl. This may
                            indeed be sufficient reason for "turkish corn" in several languages, as
                                <hi rend="i">wlsch-korn</hi> or foreign corn is one of the
                            designations of maize in German.</p>
                        <p>John Clayton, the parson, says in a letter to the Royal Society in the
                            seventeenth century about Virginia: "There's a great sort of ravenous
                            Bird that feeds apon Carrion as big very nigh as an Eagle, which they
                            call a Turkey Bustard,... whence its name; it is nothing of the same
                            sort of Bird as our Turkey Bustard." Johnson's Dictionary of 1755
                            defines "bustard" by "a wild turkey." We may not conclude from Clayton's
                            term that the great vulture was called a turkey bustard before he became
                            a buzzard, for a dozen years earlier in these Transactions, xi, 631,
                            Glover writes "Turkie Buzzard," and very much earlier yet, in 1614,
                            Hamor has "Turkie Bussards." The author of the True Declaration of
                            Virginia, 1610, does not know either name; he calls the birds
                            "cormerants." One might suspect that the name is a corruption of
                            "bastard turkey" (compare "bastard plover" in the <pb id="VAA2405-142"
                                n="131"/> regulations of Henry VIII's household, Forsyth's
                            Antiquary's Portfolio, i, 187), or that it has some relation to the
                            French <hi rend="i">dindon batard,</hi> but there is no evidence in
                            favor of such a conjecture. The vulture was often mistaken for the
                            turkey. Castiglioni Viaggio negli Stati Uniti, i, 225. We have indeed a
                            tangle of the names of two large European birds, the buzzard and the
                            bustard, with the American turkey and turkey buzzard. It is with
                            pleasure that I pass the puzzle to philologists. Apropos of the possible
                            confusion one way or the other between <hi rend="i">dindon bastard</hi>
                            and turkey bustard or buzzard, there is in Le Page du Pratz, Histoire de
                            la Louisiana, 1738, ii, 418, a curious distortion of another English
                            name of this same vulture, which he calls "Carencro" [that is, carrion
                            crow], "qui est aussi noir qu'un Merle &amp; aussi gros qu'un
                            Dindon."</p>
                        <p>The suggestion of Acosta is that since the Italians call maize grano
                            turco, Pliny's description of millet may have been intended for maize,
                            and that the plant may have been known to the ancients. It was as hard
                            to believe in that day that there was anything of value unknown to Pliny
                            as that there could be any truth of philosophy not deducible from
                            Aristotle. The confusion between buckwheat, or "saracen wheat" as it was
                            called, and the newer maize, though not heretofore suspected, is almost
                            beyond doubt. Lescarbot, in La Conversion des Savvages, 1610, gives a
                            list of plants cultivated by the Iroquois. In it there appears "du bl
                            mahis (ou Sarazin)." In the Burrows reprint of the Jesuit Relations, i,
                            85, this passage is Englished by "maize wheat (or Buckwheat)." If this
                            rendering were correct, it would still show the confusion of the two,
                            but Lescarbot did not suppose any grain but maize to exist among the
                            Indians. "Sarazin" is here but another name for maize, in explanation of
                            the less familiar "bl mahis," or more properly "mays." The name in
                            French or Italian was conferred, no doubt, when it was yet not well
                            distinguished from buckwheat, and it was probably used at first
                            interchangeably with bl de turquie, the notion of origin conveyed being
                            identical in the two names. "Grano saraceno" appears to be still applied
                            in Italian to both maize and buckwheat. Baretti's Italian-English
                            Dictionary, edition of 1854, has no other definition of "grano saraceno"
                            than maize, while it defines maize by "fromentone, grano saraceno, grano
                            turco." Yet Castiglioni adheres to "frumento saraceno" or "grano
                            saraceno" for buckwheat, and "grano turco" for maize. Viaggio negli

                            "Their beanes... are the same which the Turks call garvances," an

                            and "large beans" appear as two of the garden vegetables cultivated in
                            New Sweden. The original Swedish at p. 167 has "Turskska Bnor" and "stra
                            Bonor," which in our common speech would be Turkish beans and pole
                            beans, indicating that the so-called Turkish beans were not grown on
                            poles, but, as we know, twined themselves about the growing corn stalks.
                            In the papers reviewing and, it might be said, enriching De Candolle's
                            Origin of Cultivated Plants, the learned authors, Gray and Trumbull,
                            have missed the passage above in De Vries, which would have shown the
                            error in Van der Donck that they suspect. See American Journal of
                            Science for August, 1883, p. 134. Van der Donck is so far misled by the
                            name "Turkish" as to suppose the Indian bean to have been introduced by
                            the Dutch. The name gallivance is applied to some plant in Pennsylvania
                            soon after Penn's settlement, and in a Complete Discovery of the state
                            of Carolina, 1682, the name appears as "Callavance," from which we need
                            not infer the presence of the garabanzo as cultivated in Spain, Mexico,
                            etc., but merely a confusion of very different plants by people who had
                            not seen both.</p>
                        <p>The New England "rye and Indian" was known in the eighteenth century, and
                            perhaps earlier; it figures strangely in Castiglioni's Italian as "grano
                            turco misto con segale formano delle crescenze senza lievito." The
                            phrases "English grain" and "English grass" appear to have survived in
                            New England until the American Revolution abolished all things English,
                            in name at least. In a manuscript diary of Rev. Justus Forward, of

                            15, 1763, that "grass and English grain look extraordinary well"; and on
                            the preceding May IIth the diarist notes that there is "considerable

                            "Nubbin," used in English provincial dialects for the stump of a tree,
                            came into general use in America for a dwarfed ear of corn, and I
                            suspect that some analogous use of the word existed in colloquial
                            English at the time. Roasting ears, an early name for green corn in the
                            Chesapeake and middle colonies, is yet applied to green corn however
                            cooked, and whether cooked or not, over a large part of the United
                            States. Compare Beverley's Virginia, book iii, 15, and Rush's letter in
                            Castiglioni, Viaggio negli Stati Uniti, ii, 44. Acosta speaks of a large
                            round variety of corn that the Spaniards ate roasted "as a delicious
                            food, more savory than roast beans or peas." Livre iv, chap. xvi.</p>

                            still called a walnut in parts of New England and New York; it is the
                            white walnut in contradistinction to the black. But Gronovius's Flora
                            Virginica, 150, calls the butternut white walnut thus: "Juglans alba...

                        <p>Compare this word dafter, for daughter, with the old pronunciation "oft,"
                            for ought. In the Order of Orthography, by Joseph Prat, London, 1622,
                            the word ought is thus given "oft." Prat lays it down as a rule that
                            where "s" precedes the terminal "tion," the sound shun must not be
                            given, by which rule the accepted form of such words in good speech
                            would be, for example, combus-ti-on. Honor and honour, favor and favour,
                            are "indifferently written," says Prat. The word mile is unchanged in
                            the plural, as "one mile, twenty mile." As an example of the "barbarous
                            speech of the common people," he has "yerbs" for herbs, "dater" for
                            daughter, "twonty" for twenty, "feale" and "finegar" for "veale and
                            vineger."</p>
                        <p>This mixing of variant forms of rustic English was kept up by fresh
                            arrivals from England, and in the eighteenth century it was complicated
                            by the great exodus of people to some of the colonies from the north of
                            Ireland. Manifest traces of this Scotch-Irish admixture may be found in
                            Pennsylvania, in the Ohio Valley and westward, and along another line of
                            emigration in the Appalachian valleys and the table-lands of Virginia
                            and the Carolinas.</p>
                        <p>"Gom," in this dialect of the Forth and Bargy, means a simpleton; in
                            other local English it is, as in America, "gump." "Goss" in various
                            dialects means gorse or furze. As gorse is not known in the United
                            States the word has no popular meaning, but it has survived in the
                            single dialect phrase often heard in certain places, "Give him

                        <p>In Smyth's Tour, i, 235, he remarks on the unwillingness to be called a
                            servant by the frontiersman of the late colonial period. The use of the
                            word servant was evidently narrower in the colonies than in England,
                            though Mr. Albert Matthews has furnished me with several references to
                            "hired servant" and "hired servant man" in the first half of the
                            eighteenth century. As some of these were in advertisements of runaways,
                            the hired servant must have been bound by contract for a year, according
                            to the custom at that time. Even in such advertisements for runaways in
                            New Jersey, Mr. Matthews notes the term "an Irish hired man," and he has
                            furnished me with a number of instances of the modern use of the word
                            "help" in England for a person employed in a capacity a little above
                            that of a domestic servant. Under date of Philadelphia, December 6,
                            1748, Kalm says that a distinction was made by the English inhabitants
                            of Pennsylvania between a servant and a "serving or bond servant" for a
                            term of years. As the phrase does not occur in any advertisement of
                            runaways or elsewhere, so far as I know, its use must have been local.
                            Servant was applied to a slave, and thus the depth of infamy was
                            reached.</p>

                            to be that which one often hears in New England, even among educated
                            people. I have pointed out in a previous note, on the authority of
                            Franklin, the early existence in parts of Pennsylvania of what are now
                            deemed New England peculiarities. John Bartram, the Pennsylvania
                            botanist, probably used the umlaut pronunciation like a Vermonter. In
                            his Observations he writes, "We rod over middling land," p. 66. "To get
                            shut of," for to get rid of, appears in various English and American
                            dialects. "Bail" for the handle of a pail or kettle is still used in
                            dialect in England. It appears in a will of 1463, where the English
                            editor finds it needful to explain it. Compare Bury Wills, 23, 242. It
                            is in general use in the southern and western parts of the United
                            States, and accounted a preferable word. "My woman" appears more than
                            once in Braithwayt's Drunken Barnaby, 124, 171, as a respectful
                            equivalent for my wife, with "uxor" on the opposite page as the Latin.
                            This is precisely the usage of the rustic people in New England; farther
                            south the farmer says "my old woman," though his wife be never so young.
                            "Party" for person, which modern purists account recent and
                            reprehensible slang, was in abundant use in older times. Increase Mather
                            has the "sick party recovered," Providences, 192, and one even hears of
                            dear parties. The Camden Miscellany, vol. iii, quotes from MS.:</p>
                        <p rend="center">The partie nowe is gone and closelie clade in clay.</p>
                        <p>In northern regions of the United States a sick person is said by the
                            country people to be "handled" by his disease. In Howard's Collection of
                            Letters, 273, the Duke of Norfolk writes to Henry VIII, "I have ben so
                            sore handeled with myne old Disease," and there are other examples.
                            "Fall" for autumn is now mainly American, but there are English
                            precedents enough for it, and it would be a pity to lose from literary
                            use so good a word. <pb id="VAA2405-148" n="137"/> There are instances

                            difference of usage that has persisted. It has been asserted that
                            "rooster" is a word produced by American mock modesty. But "roost-fowl,"
                            at least, was a form that appeared as early as 1701, Sewall's Diary, vi,
                            33, and I have seen "roost-cock" in English use earlier than the
                            beginning of colony planting. "Toat railes" appears in the Remonstrance
                            of Gloucester County, Virginia, as early as 1677. State Paper Office,

                            in a Boston paper before the Revolution, and is found in the old "tote
                            roads" of Maine. But there are words of distinctly colonial origin.
                            "Gum" for beehive in some local dialects, came from the use of a section
                            of a hollow gum tree for hiving bees and other purposes. Compare "a
                            large cask or gum" in Virginia Gazette, June 21, 1744, and the Western
                            pioneer's proverbial boast that he was cradled in a "bee-gum." The

                        <p>For Sukey Fry and other ballads I am indebted to my daughter, Mrs.
                            Elizabeth Eggleston Seelye. They were taken from the lips of an old lady
                            of New England birth and lineage who may have been the last person
                            treasuring these bits of colonial folklore. She could remember only a
                            few verses of Sukey Fry, supplying the rest by narrative. "A young
                            nobleman coming to America met a young girl, Sukey Fry, and they fell in
                            love. He was put into prison, and she visited him and carried him things
                            to eat. He agreed, when released, to wait for her seven years unmarried.

                        <p>See the many versions of the ballad in Child's Scottish and English
                            Ballads, and especially Child's learned treatment of its variations in
                            the quarto edition, part ii, 454-483. One can not but regret that
                            Professor Child did not have the pleasure of knowing that the "Isbel,"
                            "Dame Essels," "Susy Pye," and "Sophia," of other versions had emigrated
                            with the colonists and assumed the name of Sukey Fry. Many comparisons
                            with the Scottish and the English versions suggest themselves, but they
                            must he left for folk-lorists. But is it on account of the name "Susy
                            Pye" in the ballad, or perhaps on account of the sense of colored or
                            painted in the word "pie," or "pye" that this seems to have been a name
                            for a Moor? In the Records of Massachusetts Colony, 1638, p. 239,
                            "George Pye, a Moor," appears. Rose, Pink, and Piney is among the tales
                            collected by Mrs. Seelye. Piney is the most frequent pronunciation of
                            peony in rustic speech. There is an allied story in the little
                            collection referred to called Pussy Catskin. It is substantially the
                            same story as that given in Catskin's Garland in Child's Ballads, but
                            the American version is in prose and much more antique than the ballad
                            as Child gives it. The word trencher is preserved in it, though the
                            meaning of the word must have been very obscure to those who recited it
                            last. The tale is known in many tongues. See Child's English and

                            myriad other copies to the chance that Samuel Butler once owned it and
                            wrote some lines in it.</p>
                        <p>Prof. C. E. Norton, in his Life of Anne Bradstreet prefixed to a modern
                            edition of her poems, says, "There is, I believe, no evidence that there
                            was a copy of Shakespeare's plays in Massachusetts during the
                            seventeenth century." Apropos of a line of Mrs. Bradstreet's which
                            resembles the line in Hamlet, v, ii, 337, 388, this remark is made. But,
                            as Mrs. Bradstreet was an inmate of the family of the Earl of Lincoln in
                            her youth, and a late and reluctant adherent to New England Puritanism,
                            she may have seen Hamlet on the stage in England. Shakespeare was never
                            mentioned or quoted by any American writer in the seventeenth century,
                            so far as I know. Even in England his fame was of slow growth. Peacham's
                            Compleat Gentleman, 1660, calls George Buchanan, whose fame rests on his
                            Latin poems, "the prince of poets of our time," and he does not think
                            Shakespeare worth naming at all. The bare word "Macbeth" in the Virginia
                            inventory of Captain Arthur Spicer, 1699, is the first allusion to his
                            work from an American source that I know. Another Virginian, Edmund
                            Berkeley, who died in 1718, had Shakespeare's works. William and Mary

                            seventeenth and the early eighteenth century, copied more than a hundred
                            borrowed books. Nearly all his professional books were copied by
                            himself, and "his manuscripts were all handsomely bound by himself in
                            parchment." Sibley's Harvard Graduates, ii, 410. There are volumes of
                            old Virginia statutes in the Library of Congress partly manuscript. As
                            late as 1715 (chap. xxv) Maryland enacted that all acts passed should be
                            transcribed on parchment and sent to each county, to be lodged with the
                            clerk after they had been "published and proclaimed in court." A like
                            usage prevailed in other colonies. The Mennonites in Pennsylvania were
                            advised from Europe to transcribe the colossal Martyr Book for their own
                            edification. Many examples of books written which were never destined
                            for print might be given. President Stiles's manuscripts and those by
                            William Byrd, of Westover, are notable examples. In my own collection
                            are manuscripts some of which seem to be sixteenth century copies of
                            books probably in print, others are manuscripts of the seventeenth
                            century not intended for print. There are also manuscript books on
                            various studies, especially geometry and surveying, that appear to have
                            belonged to old New York families. The custom of college students making

                            dignities of command and I government, before the common people." This

                            etc., freely without controul in all places." This rather abject
                            reverence for superiors extended to domestic life. The shining virtue of
                            a wife was obedience; resistance to a husband was rebellion against God.
                            The son served his parents in menial subjection; in some houses he was
                            required to attend them at table as a servant. He was often sent to play
                            serving man to some greater kinsman, in order to learn the etiquette of
                            subjection to superiors. When the well-trained lad encountered his
                            father or mother he did them reverence and said, "Sir," or "Madam, I
                            crave your blessing." In such an age it was easy for New England
                            lawgivers to revert to the severity of the Mosaic law against
                            disobedient children. Harsh penalties were denounced against "child or
                            servant convict of any stubborne or rebellious caridge against their
                            parents or governors," and incorrigibleness was "adiudged to be a sin of

                            of order. Distinctions were nicely marked; it has been estimated that of
                            the emigrants to New England before 1649, about one in fourteen was
                            entitled to the prefix of "Mr.," the rest were called simply "Goodman
                            So-and-so." Harvard students took their place in the catalogue according
                            to the social position of their parents as appraised by the academic
                            authorities, and the lad of humbler birth yielded the baluster side of
                            the stairs to one conventionally his superior. The seats in New England
                            meeting-houses were formally "dignified," a process by which their
                            relative value as a mark of rank was fixed, and it was then decided by
                            carefully weighing against one another the various offices in town and
                            church and trainband, as well as by comparison of estates, who should
                            sit in the places of honor. Social aspirants seeking to advance
                            themselves by intruding into seats higher than those assigned to them,
                            created disturbance in the meeting-house, and their ambitions had to be
                            repressed by fines. In the Chesapeake colonies emblems of rank were
                            sometimes attached to the pew of a governor or other officer, and the
                            great families of the parishother from whom justices of the peace and
                            vestrymen were chosenwere wont to lend the countenance of good society
                            to divine worship from exclusive pews perched high in the gallery under

                            </note> It was the period of emblemism in theology, the period of the
                            doctrine of correspondences in philosophy and of signaturism in
                            medicine. To the mind of the time a clever metaphor was more convincing
                            than an argument, and an analogy was almost irrefutable. Passive
                            obedience to the reigning sovereign was fortified by the prevailing
                            conception of right and wrong as dependent solely on the pleasure of the
                            Deity. But the great leaders of Puritanism, finding their plans opposed
                            by royal authority, cleverly succeeded in making the rule work the other
                            way. From the notion of God's relation to morals they evolved an ideal
                            of theocracy. Divine sovereignty became a cover for latent disobedience
                            to the king. "The allegiance we owe to our dread sovereign lord King
                            Charles" is the courtly phrase of Cotton, but while he thus doffs his
                            hat to the king with his right hand, he furtively opens a back door of
                            escape with the left, by adding the ambiguous saving clause, "whilst he
                            is pleased to protect us as his loyal subjects."</p>

                            England; the profane man was fined and set in the stocks. One
                            Connecticut blasphemer was to have his second whipping in the January
                            following his first, "except the governor judges the weather
                            unseasonable." In early Virginia records the fines for swearing are from
                            one to three shillings, and in one case, in 1634, the parson is the
                            prosecutor. A Harvard student, who had spoken words regarding the Holy
                            Ghost which were thought blasphemous, was publicly solemnly beaten; the
                            punishment was preceded and followed by prayer, a kind of grace before
                            and after. The student's offense lay probably in the expression of
                            unorthodox opinions, the most atrocious kind of blasphemy. He was
                            subjected to other indignities after the beating, either to convince him
                            of error or to propitiate an offended Deity. It was an accepted theory
                            with ardent religionists, whether Catholic or Protestant, that heretical
                            opinions regarding God <pb id="VAA2405-160" n="149"/> should be punished

                            flag had only a white field in the upper corner for a union. For similar
                            reasons the early Puritan settlers omitted the prefix "Saint" from
                            familiar geographical names. For long generations Englishmen had paid

                            The pinch of the inconvenient scruple was got over by a trick of words:
                            the names of the days were purified from idolatry by being called
                            "planetary names"; but colonial New England continued to refuse to speak
                            of "the Lord's Day" as Sunday. Puritan refugees from Protestant
                            persecution in Virginia refused to take an oath of fidelity to the
                            government of Maryland, because the officers of Maryland had sworn not
                            to molest Roman Catholics, and what was that but swearing to countenance
                            and uphold Anti-Christ? And so by many links, through their oaths to the
                            government and Church and through the governors and their oaths, and

                            grunts and inarticulate cries, were naturally taken for worship of a
                            false god or of a devil. The Virginia Company had much earlier proposed
                            to capture the Indian medicine men and thus put an end to such heathen
                            mysteries. The ancient maxim that "dominion hath its foundation in
                            grace" was accepted in the earliest colonies, and hence Christians
                            dominated pagans by right divine. One writer intimates that some of the
                            Virginia planters, about the middle of the century, carried their
                            Christianity so far as to believe that a pagan had no right to property

                            Court to be "altogether unlawful in the very nature of them," since in

                            and directly abused and prophaned." Cotton even unlimbered his
                            scholastic logic to prove that the merry nonsense of choosing mates on
                            Valentine's day by drawing papers from a hat was an appeal to God's
                            "immediate providence for dispensing these ludicra," and hence "a taking
                            God's name in vain." To check "the great dishonor of God" that was
                            wrought by games, the Massachusetts Legislature, in 1670, excluded cards
                            and dice from the colony as things pernicious in their very nature. The

                            frivolity and cruelty. From morris dancing, from intolerably coarse

                            was provided with instructions which required that "vain sports bee
                            refrained" on the Lord's Day, which was to be observed with "divine
                            exercises according to the common prayer." James I had tried to check
                            the tide of Sabbatarianism, but his so-called Book of Sports had
                            precisely as much effect as the memorable command of his remote
                            predecessor Knut against the incoming sea. He never learned that great
                            lesson of statesmanship that once Humpty Dumpty is down the king himself
                            can not replace him. James tried to compel Englishmen to amuse

                            also forbids "Studying any Bookes of Science but the holy Scripture and
                            Divinitie," and "all recreations and Sports which at other times are
                            lawful," with "all grosse feeding" and "all talking about worldly
                            things." This view of duty was enforced by arraying the very same
                            horrible examples that had served in Bownd's famous treatise on the
                            Sabbath. Did not the scaffolding fall like the tower in Siloam and kill
                            the people at a Sunday bear baiting in London? And this not at all on
                            account of their inhumanity to the bear, but solely because they were
                            enjoying "carnall Sports on the Lord's Day." Dr. Bownd's nobleman whose
                            hunting on Sunday caused his child to come into the world with a dog's
                            face reappears in Bayly. A disastrous conflagration in Stratford-on-A

                        <p>Here we come upon those forces that made the culture of Virginia as
                            distinctively secular as that of New England was dominantly theological.
                            There were physical difficulties obstructing religious observance in the
                            Chesapeake region, where habitations were thinly strung out along the
                            estuaries, rivers, and tributary creeksmere sinuous lines of water side
                            settlement with only forest behind. There were plantations that had
                            never an entrance or exit by land. Some parishes were thirty miles and
                            more in shore length, and when the web-footed pioneers would attend
                            church they must commonly do it by sailing in their sloops or by
                            laborious paddling in dugouts. After the passing of Hunt and Whittaker
                            and other brave missionaries of the first generation there came a
                            different race of clergymen, "such as wore Black Coats, and could babble
                            in a Pulpet, roar in a Tavern,... and rather, by their dissolutenesse,
                            destroy then feed their Flocks." The church was far away, the parson
                            contemptible, but no doubt some of the isolated settlers resorted to
                            service to meet their neighbors and relieve the tedium of loneliness.</p>

                        <p>But many of the younger Virginians, and those of the rougher class,
                            generally preferred to spend the idle day of the week at the nearest
                            Indian village in rude amusements and intercourse with the bar. barians.
                            There was a considerable betterment of manners in the times of the
                            English Common-wealth, when exiled Cavaliers brought in a more dignified
                            way of living and a better regulated Sunday. Throughout the colonial
                            period the Virginia Sunday was never a rigorous Sabbath, but mainly a
                            day of leisure, of sport, and of social enjoyment, with resort to the
                            Church service when convenient. The typical country squire of the
                            Chesapeake region treated religion as a mere propriety, by no means to
                            be taken too seriously; there were many in the eighteenth century who
                            rejected it altogether. It came to pass, thus, that the Virginia mind
                            was coolly secular and unspeculativean intellect trained to affairs, and
                            above all to politics and social intercourse. Virginia's early
                            contribution to the intellectual life of the country was naturally a
                            political one. The difference between the outcome of colonial Virginia
                            and that of colonial New England might almost be anticipated by
                            observing the wide difference between the early Virginia Sunday and the
                            Puritan Sabbath. New England was cradled in religious enthusiasms that
                            gave tone to life in the whole northern belt of the United States. If
                            Virginia and the States of her planting have lacked that reformatory
                            zeal which has made New England so generally serviceable, <pb
                                id="VAA2405-171" n="160"/> and sometimes so tedious, it is probably
                            because Virginia was almost untouched by any strong religious sentiment,
                            until it was at length stirred by the evangelical movement in the middle
                            of the eighteenth century.<note id="note_500" place="left"

                            man toward God. And a right divine reverence was paid to it. Contrary to
                            English custom, the greatest Puritan divines, Cotton and Hooker,
                            maintained with consistent literalness that the consecrated time began
                            at sunset on Saturday evening, because the Jewish Sabbath began on
                            Friday, and the evening and the morning made a day in the first chapter
                            of Genesis. Judaism sat hard on the Puritan conscience in many ways; <pb

                            whipping-post. In New Haven, and probably elsewhere, indulgence in
                            eating an apple or cracking a nut was accounted reprehensible. In solemn
                            awe of the Sabbath the innocent gambols of the children were repressed
                            as something particularly heinous. "We should rest from labor, much more

                            Babes. The aged Increase Mather, as late as 1712, urged that children
                            must not be suffered to play on the Lord's Day. Of rest the Puritan mind
                            had no <pb id="VAA2405-173" n="162"/> conception; it was a technical

                            heretics and its horror of witches, caused so much human unhappiness in
                            the aggregate as did its effort to transform the Christian Sunday into a
                            punctilious Hebrew Sabbath. For the attainment of this end almost every
                            sort of outrage on personal liberty was perpetrated by the magistrates
                            and by domestic authority. Even foreigners presumably ignorant of the
                            law were liable to arrest and other indignities, if caught strolling in
                            the streets of Boston on Saturday evening after sunset. Ambassadors from
                            a French Catholic colony were shut into Winthrop's house the entire
                            Sunday for fear of collision with public opinion and the constables.
                            This polite incarceration was mitigated by "the liberty of a private
                            walk in the garden." In New Haven, in 1647, a young man was sent to the
                            whipping-post on Monday for not going to meeting on Sunday, and two
                            brothers were beaten by their father for visiting young women on
                            Saturday after sunset. They lived unmarried to their deaths from

                            worship. An election sermon was leveled at this uprising, and the Synod
                            of 1679 even shakes at it the old superstition used by Dr. Bownd in
                            1595, and later in the Practice of Piety, that conflagrations are
                            intimately connected with lax Sabbath observance. And indeed the New
                            England Sabbath, though almost too much for flesh and blood, had by this
                            time become a fixed tradition, good for yet more than a hundred years of
                            survival before it should begin to show signs of decline. In 1740 we

                            English Church of that time could not do, resulted in 1699 and the
                            following years in the establishment of societies for religious
                            propagandismboth by printed publications and the sending of
                            missionariesa device by which Protestantism has sought to supply the
                            loss of the medival religious orders. The outgrowth of the devout
                            societies did not weaken their organizations. One of these nurseries of
                            pietism at a much later time bore the nickname of the Holy Club of
                            Oxford, and out of it issued the Wesley-Whitefield revivala revival that
                            primarily sought not to build up any Church or sect, but to benefit the
                            brutal and neglected by means of religious influences. Thus a zeal for
                            pity's sake took the place of the old stern and pitiless passion for
                            what was thought to promote the glory of God. White-hot agitations that

                            please God the plain man must know "the essence of God in respect of the
                            divers manner of being therein," and also the "attributes which are
                            either Nominall or Real." That is to say, he must appreciate the
                            "absoluteness," "simpleness," and "infiniteness "of Divine existence,
                            and then must know five "relative attributes" besides. If the

                            This service of God begins and ends in acts of devotion performed
                            "privately," "domestically," and "publicly," with remembrance of feasts
                            and a yet more scrupulous observance of fasts. Religious etiquette all!

                            devoutness. Duties to one's fellows, such as fill the Sermon on the
                            Mount, find no place in the outspread diagram of duties with which the
                            book begins, and it is with difficulty that they find standing room in a
                            few subsidiary parts of the work. The medival virtue of almsgiving, with
                            an eye to the welfare of the giver in the next world, appears in

                            not preceded by "effectual calling," was mere sin. Wigglesworth in his
                            Day of Doom marshals at the bar of God a company of <q

                                    <l n="2">That loved true Dealing and hated Stealing,</l>
                                    <l n="3">Ne'er wronged their Brethren.</l>
                                </lg>
                            </q> But these worthy men, whose like is none too common, are summoned
                            only to be scorned and damned. "The Ninevites and Sodomites," they are
                            told, had no such sin as theirs. "Their righteousness is sin," the Judge
                            tells them, "whereas the same deserveth Shame and meriteth Damnation."
                            Thus the ideal of morality itself is abrogated in order to "glorify God
                            as God" in the damnation of civil honest men. Fortunately for the world,
                            theories that controvert fundamental intuitions are likely to be only
                            speculatively believed. Neither Cotton nor Wigglesworth could have been
                            as bad as his theory; in practice they probably respected honest men and
                            detested scoundrels regardless of theological considerations. But such
                            speculations when they reached weaker natures would serve as pretexts
                            for immorality.</p>

                            judgments were off their center when men adored a God worse than the
                            worshipers. It seems like a paradox, yet it is true, that the more
                            intensely religious a people were in that time the worse was their
                            representation of the Deity. The great and long-continued popularity of
                            Wigglesworth's Day of Doom in New England makes it good evidence in this
                            case. His damnation scene is medivally horrible:</p>

                        <p>Irresponsible infants were condemned to perdition by the ruthlessly
                            systematic theology of the seventeenth century, and this also for the
                            glory of the God who made them. The medival churchly doctrine that none
                            could be saved without the sacrament of baptism had carried with it the
                            harsh corollary that many infants were damned, some of them lost through
                            mere accident or inadvertence. Cranmer's Catechism of 1548 declares that
                            the children of heathen parents will be "damned everlastingly" for want
                            of baptism, and in this he follows the Lutherans of the same period. In
                            the next century Archbishop Laud, while affirming that baptism <pb
                                id="VAA2405-186" n="175"/> is necessary to salvation, declines to
                            bind God to the sacrament, probably from his habitual dislike of
                            constitutional limitations to sovereign power.<note id="note_551"

                            children grow up nameless heathens or die heirs of perdition for want of

                            Governor Eden of that colony wrote to the Propagation Society lamenting
                            especially that "above fourscore" infants had perished unbaptized in the
                            massacre by the Tuscaroras in 1712. This view of the massacre is

                            narrow fringe of uncertainty. They averred, as others of their school of
                            thought had done long before, that an obscure phrase in St. Paul's most
                            obscure epistle rendered it certain that some infants had already been
                            damned for eating the forbidden fruit by proxy before they were born. On
                            the other hand, Wigglesworth, the doggerel Dante of pioneer New England,
                            reserved the damnation of unlucky babes to make an effective scene at
                            the day of doom. The widespread circulation of his verses must have sown
                            broadcast notions out of which every bereaved mother could build a
                            tabernacle of perdition for her desolate soul. Minds so simply serious

                            put into the mouth of the Divine Judge, whom Wigglesworth makes a little
                            lower than a pettifogging country justice. The foredoomed infants argue
                            their case rather cleverly, and, from a modern point of view, they get
                            the best of it. But Christ, the Judge, has <pb id="VAA2405-188" n="177"

                            school. It had accustomed them to such lines as these:</p>

                            George Sandys, once Secretary of the Virginia Colony, was far more
                            elegant and was "set to new tunes for private devotion." But even Sandys
                            will have the Christian in his closet pronounce a blessing on the men</p>

                        <p>This non-Christian corn mingling of revenge and religion gave force to

                            contests. Hear the bitter words of Ward, a New England minister, against
                            the Irish rebels: "Cursed be he that holdeth back his sword from blood,
                            yea cursed be he that maketh not his sword starke drunk with Irish
                            blood," and so on breathlessly to the end. These words of Nathaniel Ward
                            were printed in London in 1647; two years later Cromwell translated them
                            into ghastly fact by the pitiless slaughters of Drogheda and

                            </note> Massachusetts clergymen protested in 1635 against Winthrop for a
                            leniency that to the modern man seems severe. In the controversy with
                            the Gortonists the Massachusetts clergy advised that men not properly
                            subject to the colony should be hanged for constructive blasphemy, but
                            the magistrates were wiser or less zealous. The clerical profession, by
                            its very nature, is more dominated by ideal considerations than others,
                            and the severity of clergymen in governmental affairs is not necessarily
                            from harshness of spirit, but rather from devotion to an ideal of
                            conduct. The pressure of religious feeling in former ages was often
                            distinctly opposed to the sentiment of humanity., But the seventeenth
                            century needed no religious persuasion to severity; it was not at all a
                            humane age. Traces of medival barbarism are found in the laws, in the
                            customs, and in the brutal sports of the people, as well as in the

                            </note> Some of the later Puritans argued that as the animosity of
                            animals to one another was the result of man's sin, men ought not to
                            make sport out of it. The suffering of the animal is rarely alluded to
                            in these debates; theology did not care for bulls and bears.
                            Cockfighting had been for ages a reputable sport, highly praised by such
                            men as Ascham, the tender-hearted school reformer, and it was practiced
                            (annually or oftener) in schoolrooms apparently as a part of education.
                            Against this also some later Puritans protested. As late as 1737 an
                            English traveler says that Continental people were accustomed to
                            complain of the cruelty of "the sports of our vulgar "the very charge

                            and the tormenting of tame bears were not imported to America; bulls
                            were too scarce and valuable, and bears were too plentiful and fierce

                            "cormorant," as making rare sport when wounded and turned loose to be
                            badgered by dogs. Animals appear to have been preferably put to death by
                            dogs. One finds Archbishop Sandys in Elizabeth's time trying to recover
                            a "brinded dog," and complaining that he had never a dog with which to
                            kill some bucks that had lately been given him. Puritanism was
                            reformatory, though it could never go far beyond its age, and did not
                            break the tether by which the great Cartwright in the sixteenth century
                            had tied it to the temporal laws of the Jews. Massachusetts had gone to
                            the limit by its creditable and ungrammatical law of 1641 against
                            "Crueltie to any bruite creature which are usuallie kept for man's use."
                            The wild creatures were left with-out the pale for want of Mosaic
                            precedent, no doubt. In Virginia and Maryland cockfighting was a
                            gentlemanly and Christian amusement throughout the colonial time. The
                            laws of the Puritan colonies show that the reformatory spirit in
                            Puritanism had begun to soften a little the harsh cruelty of law and its
                            administration at the time, but notwithstanding prohibitions against
                            cruel and unusual punishments, burning to death took place in Boston and
                            Cambridge and pressing to death was resorted to in the witchcraft trials

                            greater than moral duty. "The languishing and improsperous condition "of
                            the Virginians after the Restoration was not attributed to the
                            strangling of their commerce by the enforcement of the Navigation Act,
                            but to the neglect of the people, mainly on account of physical
                            impediments, to render to God with regularity "that publicke Worship and

                        <p>Virginia had been settled when no hard-and-fast line had yet been drawn
                            between Puritan and non-Puritan churchmen, and its church cherished
                            both, retaining down to the Revolution the partycolor of the transition
                            period in which it was planted. Its clergy wore no surplices for more
                            than a hundred years after the settlement, and in some parishes the
                            eucharist was taken in a sitting posture. In New England the sacraments
                            were hard to come by; in some parts of Virginia they could not be
                            refused. One Virginian, in 1645, was threatened for refusing to go to
                            communion in his parish church and required to bring to the next session
                            of the court a certificate that he had reformed in this particular. In
                            New England the baptism of babes was not always to be had for the
                            asking; Virginians who declined baptism for their children were
                            sometimes dealt with.</p>

                            the hard conditions of pioneer life where the burden of one might have
                            been thought too much. A ruling elder and several deacons shared
                            authority with the "pastor" and the "teacher "; to complete the
                            hierarchy, "ancient widows" were concluded to be church officers from
                            their position in the Pauline epistles. This system in five tiers,
                            originally separatist, was brought to America, in theory at least, by
                            the Pilgrims, and, after discussion, came to be adopted by most of the
                            Massachusetts churches. No plan could well have suited less with
                            frontier conditions. The support of two ministers was an irksome
                            financial burden; a double leadership promoted factions; ministers in
                            the second generation were scarce; and the dual system, unsuited to the
                            environment, went into swift obsolescence in spite of the lament of
                            idealists <pb id="VAA2405-197" n="186"/> and the futile efforts of the
                            Synod of 1679 to restore the double pastorate of the founders. The
                            unnecessary ruling elder went out more gradually, and the proposed
                            ecclesiastical widows were found impossible from the first, in a new
                            country where every woman not decrepit was sure to be sought in

                            congregations but half that number. In some places the worship was
                            without singing, failing any one who could "take the run of the tune,"

                            the same tune varied essentially in congregations a few miles apart; in
                            some places the name of an old tune was all that could be recognized,
                            the music having been "miserably tortured and twisted and quavered into
                            a horrible medley of confused and disorderly noises." A writer of 1721
                            declares that the music was so "dragged" that it was necessary sometimes
                            to take breath twice in one note. Psalm singing in the other colonies
                            was probably not better than that in New England. In the Anglican
                            churches, as in Puritan worship, the psalm to be sung was read off line
                            by line before the several lines were sung. One of the reforms advocated
                            by Commissary Bray during his brief dash into Maryland in 1700 was the
                            teaching of catechumens to sing the psalm "artificially." Even at the
                            beginning of the Revolution Boucher declares that the psalmody was
                            everywhere "ordinary and mean."</p>

                            notion that pleasure had something reprehensible about it. People
                            opposed church music on this ground, accusing it of "bewitching the mind
                            with syrenes sound." But colonial psalm singing could hardly be charged

                            </note> Very slowly these new decencies of worship made their way. A
                            church organ was too "ceremonial" even for the innovating Brattle Street
                            Church, which refused a proffered gift of one. Not only must music be
                            sung by rote and prayers not be read, but sermons must be given without
                            notes. Warham, the first to use notes in the pulpit, was "much faulted
                            for it." Puritanism habitually regarded religion and beauty as
                            antagonists. Its leaders in England condemned the use of rhetorical
                            ornaments, particularly those drawn from heathen sources. The bare
                            hardness of expression and the absence of anything like style in early
                            New England sermons was probably voluntary at first. Little conventional
                            decorums, like the ring in marriage and marriage by a minister, and
                            receiving the eucharist without gloves on, were the butt of scruples. At
                            their first coming the New-Englanders called their places of worship
                            churches, but here was a fine opening for scrupulosity. In order not to
                            ascribe sacredness to a building, the merely descriptive term
                            meeting-house was substituted, that being wholly free from any pleasant

                            reason the early Massachusetts churches formally confirmed the choice of
                            a pastor by "silent votes" of some sort in the presence of the

                        <p>Minor Many scruples of that age must pass unnoticed; a few others we may
                            select for their bric-a-brac interest. The giving to children pious and
                            significant names was not primarily a Puritan notion; Bishop Jewell has
                            a whole page of black letter in favor of it, and he derives it from
                            Chrysostom, the Church father. Cartwright, the Puritan leader of
                            Elizabeth's time, also opposed the giving of pagan names to children.
                            The scruple was too congenial to the Puritan mind not to find a place in
                            New England, and the early Latin canons, already quoted, <pb
                                id="VAA2405-202" n="191"/> forbade the giving of "barbarous and
                            superstitious names," and recommended those that are "expressed in

                            whose frequent incongruity with Saxon surnames was not then felt, but
                            also with nouns, verbs, and participles, such as Love, Hope, Unite,
                            Increase, Seaborn, Preserved, Wrastle, Humility, Supply, Hopestill,
                            Waitstill, and other significant and hortatory words, some of them given

                            governor found means of counting, probably from tax lists, the white and
                            black bondsmen. Simple addition did the rest, and there was no
                            pestilence. The inhabitants of New Jersey, "being generally of New
                            England extraction, and thereby enthusiasts," as Governor Hunter said,
                            "were more difficult to count." In a later census of New York, females
                            above sixty years of age were omitted. This bit of chicane practiced
                            against Omniscience allayed the pious fears of the people.

                            exercises the moral nature of the race is developed; by such efforts to
                            attain a visionary and impossible excellence is the sense of right and
                            wrong made strenuous enough to refuse the bribes of sensuality and of
                            worldly ambition. The successors of those who exercised their
                            consciences on frivolous judgments about apparel, psalm singing, and
                            imaginary idolatries in the names of islands and days, may put their
                            hereditary strenuousness or their traditional preference for ethical
                            considerations into the promotion of substantial social betterments. The
                            ferment may not be pleasant, but the brew is good at the last. The
                            weakness of Puritanism was the weakness of its age. The Virginia
                            justice, like the New England magistrate, toiled at the task of
                            reformation by punishing with fines, and stocks, and branks, and ducking
                            stool, and whipping-post, offenders for lying, swearing, scolding,
                            drunkenness, and other sins. Such was the English method in the Stuart
                            period. Neither among Puritans nor among Anglicans was there any clear
                            vision of the spiritual advantage of <pb id="VAA2405-205" n="194"/>
                            morality, it was the outside of the cup and platter that got all this
                                rubbing.<note id="note_605" place="left" anchored="yes">

                            </note> But Pharisaism is a stage in human progress. More objectionable
                            than the externalism was the absence of humanity. The pitiless
                            penalties, the punishments inflicted on mere children and on half-insane
                            women for hysterical words and acts, the ruthless creeds, the ferocious
                            pursuit of the weak and defenseless accused of witchcraft or heresy, the
                            unreproved delight of the mob in seeing brutes torn to pieces by dogs,
                            provoke something like execration. But condemnation dies upon the lips
                            when we reflect that ages to come may find many things damnable in the
                            civilization of a more modern time.</p>

                        <p>Down to the Revolution class distinctions were sharply marked, especially
                            in New York and Virginia. Compare Castiglioni, Viaggi negli Stati Uniti,
                                <hi rend="i">passim</hi>, Pictet's Tableau des tats Unis, ii, 181,

                            well-known authorities. The maintenance of social distinctions in the
                            assignment of seats in church was of course English. There is an
                            instance of elaborate classification according to the rank in the
                            Assembly Books of the Borough of Eye in 1650, in the Tenth Report of the
                            Royal Historical MSS. Commission, part iv, p. 534, where both the
                            northern and southern colonial ways are exemplified. The twenty-four
                            common councilmen of Eye sat together, as the burgesses did at Annapolis
                            in the eighteenth century. On the effect of the aristocratic
                            preconception in law, compare Cotton's proposed laws of 1641, where
                            three punishments are prescribed for slander. The third is, "By stripes
                            if the slander be gross, or odious against such persons whom a man ought
                            to honor and cherish, whether they be his superiors or in some degree of
                            equality with himself or his wife." Ward, who wrote the code preferred

                        <p>The notion expressed in this beginning of the Assembly's Catechism was
                            perhaps suggested by the first question and answer in Calvin's
                            Catechism:</p>
                        <p>M. Quis human vit prcipuus est finis?</p>

                        <p>Compare the Select Cases of Conscience, by Shephard, of Cambridge, Mass.,
                            p. 14, and his Treatise on the Sabbath. A more moral theism than that of
                            the Westminster Assembly was held in that time by Sir Kenelm Digby, who
                            says, "Man is governed by God alwaies for the good of Man himself."</p>
                        <p>By the Constitution of 1638 the several plantations in Connecticut agreed
                            to "conjoyne our selves to be one Publike State or Comonwelth," and
                            entered into Combination and Confederation together, to mayntayne and

                            compare Cotton's Abstract of Laws, iv, 4.</p>
                        <p>Cotton appeals to the favorite casuist of the Puritans, Dr. Perkins, who
                            held that the Scripture contains a "platforme, not onely of theology,
                            but also of other sacred sciences (as he calls them), . . . ethiks,
                            oeconomicks, politicks, church government, prophecy, academy." It was
                            characteristic of the age that this conclusion was not deduced from the
                            subject-matter of the Bible, but from the fitness of things. "It is very
                            suitable to God's all-sufficient wisdome," argues Cotton. Letter written
                            in 1636 to Lord Say and Seal in Hutchinson's Massachusetts, i, 497. In

                        <p>Punishment for blaspheming was derived from the mediaeval codes. Antonius
                            Mattheeus the second, in his De Criminibus, published in 1644, p. 643,
                            says that in Holland the old rubric against blaspheming "the Mother of
                            God, the saints or saintesses "(Moeder Gods, oft den sancten, of
                            sanctinnen), was changed at the Reformation to a law against blasphemy
                            of Almighty God or his holy word. But Matthaeus quotes Plato's Minos
                            that it is an indignity to the Deity to speak evil of a "man like
                            himself"that is, any good man.</p>
                        <p>There were those apparently who evaded the law against health drinking by
                            merely drinking to one another. This is condemned in a Massachusetts act
                            of September, 1639, Records, i, 271. Compare the Pennsylvania law of
                            1682 and that of 1705 "Against Health Drinking," in which the tendency
                            to intemperance is made the ostensible reason. See also Winthrop's
                            Journal in various places. Practical reasons, such as the danger of
                            excess, probably lay below all the objections to health drinking, but it
                            was characteristic of the age that the religious reasons were sent to
                            the fore, especially by the earlier objectors. In the "Great Evil of
                            Health Drinking," published in 1684, the profaneness of the practice and
                            its danger are both urged. Retrospective Review, xii, 322. Health
                            drinking was thought to have been introduced into England at the time of

                        <p>The reader is referred to my tracing of this early rise of Sabbathism in
                            The Beginners of a Nation. To the authorities there cited I here add
                            Cranmer's Catechism, so called, which I had not seen when that work
                            appeared. Its date is about 1548. "And therefore that this Christian
                            libertie maye be kepte and mainteyned, we now kepe no more the saboth on
                            Saturday as the Jews do, but we observe the Sondaye and certayne other
                            daies as the maistrates do iudge it convenient." This catechism was
                            rendered from a Latin version made by Justus Jonas of a German
                            catechism. The Lutheran catechism adds "the pastors of the churches" to
                            the magistrates in the passage quoted above. In both catechisms these
                            Sabbaths and holy days of human appointment are to be rather strictly
                            devoted to religious duties and not to idleness and "ungodly works."
                            Compare Catechism of Thomas Becon, chaplain to Cranmer, pp. 82, 83,
                            where the ground is substantially the same.</p>
                        <p>Laxity in Sabbath keeping brought "Wrath Fires and other judgments upon a
                            professing people," declared the Synod of 1679. There are traces of this
                            association of fires with neglect of the Sabbath or divine worship in
                            several places. Compare Plymouth Records, v, 177. Penhallow, writing in
                            1725 of the eastern Indian wars, says very ambiguously, "It is
                            remarkably observable that among all the settlements and towns of figure
                            and distinction, not one of them have been utterly destroyed wherever a
                            church was gathered." Perhaps churches were rarely "gathered " in
                            pioneer towns. Compare the "nede and povertie " anciently believed to
                            befall Sabbath breakers, as in Cranmer's Catechism of 1548 on the
                            "thirde precepte," Oxford edition, 1829, p. 43, and the corresponding

                        <p>On pp. 4 and 5 of the Practice of Piety some of the things that must be
                            known are thus set forth for a hair-splitting generation: "In the Vnity
                            of the Godhead there is a <hi rend="i">plurality</hi> which is not <hi
                                rend="i">accidentall</hi> (for God is a most pure <hi rend="i"
                            >act</hi> and admits no accidents) nor essentiall (for God is one
                            Essence only) but personall." There are pages of this ethereal
                            verbalism. In the Select Cases of Conscience, by Shephard, of Cambridge,
                            Mass., there is an abstruse disquisition "Of Conceiving aright of the
                            Holy Trinity," and another "Of Ordering the thoughts aright in Civil
                            Employments." From one on "Sinful Distractions" this example of the
                            absence of a discriminating sense of proportion will serve: "You do not
                            onely deserve, but are under the sentence of death and curse of God,
                            immediately after the least hairs-breadth swarving from the Law by the
                            smallest Sinne, and most involuntary accidentall infirmity," "the least
                            sinne being (ex parte objecti), in respect of God against whom it is
                            committed, as horrible and as great as the greatest." There were those
                            who maintained that ringing chimes on Sunday was as great an offense as
                            parricide, any sin being, in Shephard's phrase, "the dishonoring of
                            infinite Majesty," pp. 13, 14.</p>

                        <p>Cranmer's Catechism of 1548, edition of 1829, p. 51, says, "If we should
                            have heathen parents and dye without baptisme, we should be damned
                            everlastingly." Cranmer here follows closely the Lutheran version, which
                            reads: "Quando autem Ethnicos et impios parentes haberemus, et sine
                            baptisme moreremur, in ternum damnaremur." The phrases of the catechism
                            of Nowell, such as "digni terna damnative," as applied to the
                            unbaptized, have the inclusiveness of the church catechism, of which
                            Nowell was probably the author. Thomas Becon, chaplain to Cranmer, in
                            his elaborate catechism, vehemently repudiates the notion that Christian
                            children dying without baptism are damned, but his arguments leave no
                            room for the salvation of the infants of heathen parents. Parker Society
                            edition, p. 22 and following. Bishop Jewell admits the possible
                            salvation of men without the sacrament, and cites the penitent thief,
                            but such cases he treats as exceptional. Works, 1611, p. 261 and
                            following. Anglican theologians in the seventeenth century generally
                            content themselves with ascribing saving virtue to baptism, but they
                            seem to shrink from the converse, that all children unbaptized will be
                            damned, which was yet the general belief. Jeremy Taylor, in his Life of
                            the Holy Jesus, section ix, discourse vi, pt. ii, 24, does not follow
                            the "hard father of the children," Augustine, in denying salvation to
                            unbaptized infants, but he can not escape from the prevailing ambiguity
                            of his class. He says "well may we lament the death of poor babes"
                            unbaptized, because if it is due to the parents' neglect "we may weep as
                            those that have no hope." He throws the matter on God's goodness, but
                            with much dubiety. This narrow admission of unauthorized hope made the
                            Anglican by so much more modern and humane than such fathers as Ambrose
                            and Augustine on the one hand, and the Calvinist divines of the time on
                            the other. The value attached to baptism by the people is very evident.
                            There is somewhere an anecdote of two scapegrace parsons from Virginia,
                            who paid the expenses of a junketing tour in North Carolina by fees for
                            baptism. Story, the Quaker preacher, in 1699, heard a woman publicly
                            reproach Lillingston, the incumbent of a Maryland parish, with having
                            demanded a hogshead of tobacco for baptizing each of her five children.
                            Story's Journal, 229. It was believed in Virginia that a son of a chief
                            of the Doegs, who had been "pawewawd" or bewitched, was disenchanted and
                            healed by the administration of <pb id="VAA2405-212" n="201"/> baptism,
                            and this miracle "was taken for a convincing proof against infidelity."

                            Traditional notions about the saving efficacy of baptism were not wholly
                            eradicated from the minds of the first generation of New Englanders.
                            "The people begin to complain," writes Lechford about a dozen years
                            after Winthrop's migration, that "their children for the most part
                            remain unbaptized: and so have little more priviledge than Heathens."
                            Plaine Dealing, 89. The exclusion from baptism of the children of
                            parents not in covenant with the church led to much correspondence
                            between New England divines and Puritans in England, and tractates
                            appeared on both sides. An Apologie of the Church in New England,...
                            sent over in answer to Mr. Barnard in the year 1639, I saw in the
                            White-Kennett Library in London, and there now lies before me Church
                            Government and Church Covenant Discussed, etc., 1643. This is Richard
                            Mather's reply to thirty-two questions sent him by ministers known to
                            him in Lancashire and Cheshire. There is also before me a little volume
                            dated 1643, with a long title beginning, "A Letter of Many Ministers in
                            Old England." It contains two letters from England and two from New
                            England, the dates running from 1637 to 1640. The sore question of the
                            exclusion of many children from baptism is treated in all these
                            publications and in others of the same period, notably Cotton's Way of
                            Churches, 1645, and Hooker's Summe of Church Discipline, 1648. While
                            Cotton and Hooker lived, New England made no concession to the clamor of
                            those whose children were excluded, and the United Colonies, Plymouth
                            reserving its opinion, demanded that "Baptisme, the seale of the
                            Covenant, be administered only" to covenant members of the churches "and
                            their ymediate seed." Hazard State Papers, ii, 73, 74. The Cambridge
                            Platform, adopted in 1648, did not relax this proscripticn. But the
                            younger generation was by this time coming to the lead, the example of
                            Puritans in England was on the side of inclusion, and Quakers and
                            Baptists were a little later making inroads. Puritanism in New England
                            also felt the recoil of the Restoration in 1660. The fifth proposition,
                            adopted in 1662, indicates a sweeping change in policy. Of the two old
                            leaders still surviving, Richard Mather favored the change and John
                            Norton was temporarily absent in England. Compare the Platform of 1648,

                            these words that Robinson qualifies his acceptance of the doctrine of
                            infant damnation. Works, iii, 233.</p>
                        <p>John Cotton, whose first thought was of the integrity of his theological
                            system, maintained in his Grounds and Ends of the Baptisme of the
                            Children of the Faithfull, that elect infants have faith given to them
                            and are saved by faith. But the commoner opinion was perhaps expressed
                            by Wigglesworth, that they were sanctified "by ways unknown to men." Day
                            of Doom, xxv. One gets the notion that in the unwritten creed of New
                            England the elect infants were to be found among the baptized children
                            of the faithful. A young man of Connecticut told Story, the Quaker, that
                            unbaptized infants were all lost, but he did not think that all baptized
                            infants would be saved, and this was perhaps the popular feeling.
                            Story's Journal, 308. Cotton attached so much importance to baptism that
                            in the work cited above he expresses the opinion that a house was burned
                            on account of the owner's honest scruples regarding infant baptism. The
                            Confession of Dort, the most authoritative of Calvinist creeds, perhaps,
                            declares that the children of the faithful are holy by the free benefit
                            of the covenant in which they are included with their parents, and says
                            that pious parents ought not to doubt concerning the salvation of their
                            children taken away in infancy"pii parentes de Electione et Salute
                            suorum liberorum, quos Deus in infantia ex hac vita evocat, dubitare non

                            of the children of religious parents, took the place of the old
                            dependence on baptism.</p>

                        <p>So much of the medival limbo survived in New England Calvinism. Compare
                            Wigglesworth's "the easiest room in hell" with Dante's "primo cerchio
                            che l'abisso cigne," that circle lying round the abyss, in which are
                            heard no lamentations save sighs that made the eternal air to palpitate,
                            and where were a great throng "of infants, of women, and mature men,"
                            who had not sinned, but had missed of heaven for want of baptism.</p>

                        <p>This notion of baptism as "the gate" survived in the Anglican colonies,
                            and no doubt the limbo, or "easiest room in hell," was also a popular
                            survival elsewhere than in New England. It is noteworthy that Quakerism,
                            having no system to complete, refused to admit the damnation of infants,
                            or to impute "the sin of Adam to all the little children, so as to
                            effect their Eternal State." Story's Journal, 1699, pp. 218, 219.
                            Compare p. 308. This milder theology and the doctrine of non-resistance
                            seem to have affected the administration of law in the Quaker colony.

                        <p>The preface to the New England Psalm Book of 1640 maintains that it is a

                            book of psalms is so compleat a system of psalms which the... infinite

                        <p>In the little summary of opinions against cockfighting published in 1660
                            by Edmond Ellis and to be found in the Harleian Miscellany, as cited in
                            the margin of the text, one reads, "The baiting of the bull hath its
                            use, and therefore is commended of civil authority." Was there ever any
                            sport so reprehensible that this defense of utility was not set up in
                            its favor? From Perkins's Cases of Conscience, 1632, Ellis quotes: "The
                            antipathy and cruelty, which one beast showeth to another, is the fruit
                            of our rebellion against God, and should rather move us to mourn than to
                            rejoice." He quotes a similar argument from Bolton's General Directions
                            for a comfortable walking with God. From Dod and Cleaver he quotes a
                            direct appeal to humane feeling against cruel sports, which uses the
                            theological argument only subordinately. "This proceedeth not of a
                            tender heart.... Have our sins in Adam brought such calamities upon them
                            and shall we add unto them by cruelty in our own persons."</p>
                        <p>But the colony of East Jersey, predominantly Puritan, forbade bull
                            baiting and cockfighting as sports "which excite people to rudeness,
                            cruelty, looseness, and irreligion." Barber's Historical Collections of
                            New Jersey, 36, under "Early Moral Laws," said to be for the most part
                            extracted from a series of articles published in the Newark Daily
                            Advertiser. The date of the act is not given, but others in the same
                            section range from 1675 to 1697. Bull baiting was probably mentioned
                            only to guard against its introduction.</p>

                            difficulty of getting widows old enough and vigorous enough, see a
                            passage in Cotton's Way of the Churches, 1645. See also the Cambridge
                            Platform of 1648, chap, viii, sec. 7, where the duties of "ancient
                            widows" are defined. The New England Synod of 1679 sought to restore the
                            twofold pastorate, already hopelessly gone to decay. Question II.
                            "Plebeian ordination" by the laying on of the hands of the people was
                            practiced at first, but went out after the Synod of 1648. Dexter's
                            Congregationalism, 482, citing Magnalia, v. John Hull, in his Diary,
                            189, considers that the birth of a living male child of a woman who had
                            joined the church, though her parents were Quakers, and whose other
                            children had been still-born, was evidence that she "owned church
                            order."</p>
                        <p>The system was full-fledged among Separatists in 1582. Barclay's Inner
                            Life of the sects of the Commonwealth cites A true Discription out of
                            the Word of God of the visible Church. No doubt Barrow, the Separatist,
                            who was executed at Tyburn, was the propounder of the completed scheme,
                            though parts of it had appeared earlier among the exiles at Frankfort.
                            John Robinson's Catechism, printed in 1642, but of course written much
                            earlier, elaborates this subject carefully. I am indebted to Barclay as
                            above, p. 104, note, for this reference. On the double pastorate in
                            Holland, see The Dutch Drawne to the Life, 1664, chap. iii. What I take
                            to be the earliest New England church constitution is the Latin paper in
                            the State Paper Office, with Laud's indorsement dated 3 March, 1634that
                            is, 1635 N. S. The authorship, origin, and date of this paper are
                            obscure, but internal evidence shows that its origin probably preceded
                            the arrival of Cotton in 1633. After Cotton's ascendency began there was
                            no general requirement that women should wear veils at public worship,
                            as in this paper. The Latin is in places incorrect and badly spelled,
                            and the paper could not have come from New England after such good
                            Latinists as Norton and others arrived. In this early document ancient
                            widows are not mentioned among the servants of the church, but they are
                            not excluded by its phraseology.</p>

                            </note> But the schools that sprang up after the change of religion in
                            England marked the persistence of an ancient tradition that even such an
                            upheaval could not destroy. To find a logical point of beginning we must
                            ascend to the early Christian centuries, when the work of religious
                            teaching and proselytism marched abreast. Education was carried on in
                            primitive monasteries and in cathedral chapters of a monastic type.
                            These far-back monastic schools for teaching religion only are connected
                            by an unbroken pedigree with our complicated modern systems of child
                            training. We may account the ancient missionary schools a place of
                            beginning because it would tax patience to little purpose to <pb

                        <p>The instruction given in places of resort for the study of early
                            Christian doctrine and observance seems to be whole millenniums away
                            from the modern conception of education. There were schools or at least
                            throngs of scholars about popular Christian teachers in England in the
                            fifth century. Later than that the English youth even of the nobility
                            were crossing the channel to the renowned monasteries of Ireland "for
                            the sake of divine studies and a more continent life,... going about
                            from one master's cell to another," as Bede tells us. By this voyage to
                            a foreign land these young Englishmen learned the Latin of the service
                            book and church song, and they acquired also the elements of the wisdom
                            of that age, such as the excellence of celibacy and the purifying effect
                            of self-imposed hunger, which was efficient even to the sanctifying of
                            the polluted ground on which crimes had been committed. They learned the
                            keeping of three Lents a year, and they were taught that it was an act
                            of superior devotion in seasons of fasting to eat daily only a little
                            bread and milk after sunset, the milk being carefully skimmed. The
                            proper order of singing the psalter and a method of fixing the true date
                            of Easter were also taught, along with the doctrine of the damnation of
                            infants unbaptized, <note id="note_644" place="unspecified"

                            the semi-monastic free school grew up alongside them both. The
                            rudimentary school in the house of the detached priest got its impulse
                            and direction from the higher schools in the cathedrals, and by slow
                            changes the local priest's school became the parish school, and in
                            prosaic modern times, by a series of transformations, the American

                        <p>Before the Reformation the main reliance for education was on the convent
                            schools. Young women were sent to the nunneries to learn to "work and
                            reade." Sometimes girls were given a little Latin also. Boys learned
                            Latin in their hornbooks and other "abcees." English in black-letter
                            characters came after. The barbarous medival Latin, often grotesquely
                            macaronied with the vulgar speech, was widely used in records and
                            account books of the time. When the monasteries were <pb

                            the English nation was faced by the ugly fact that it had pretty nearly
                            abolished the education of the times, such as it was.<note id="note_647"

                            in as many months. But the reign of the boy king was brief; the hungry
                            courtiers had tasted the savory spoils of the monasteries, and they
                            grudged every morsel of it that was given to the new free schools. The
                            reactionary rule of Mary followed, and soon after the accession of
                            Elizabeth the Speaker of the Commons reminded the young queen of the
                            disastrous decay of learning in her kingdom. A general zeal was aroused,
                            not for the primary and popular education so much in favor in later
                            times, but for the founding of free Latin schools. Mulcaster, a
                            schoolmaster of the time, relates that the schools established in
                            Elizabeth's reign were more "than all the rest be that were before her
                            time in the whole Realme." Another writer of 1577 says that "there are
                            not manie corporat townes now vnder the queens dominion that hain not
                            one Grammar Schoole at the least." The tide wave of zeal <pb

                            its flood about the time that emigration to America began and the

                            instruction in the rudiments the dame school had grown up. This
                            gatehouse of learning was kept sometimes by a busy housewife, sometimes
                            by a young woman a little better taught than other women. Schoolmasters'
                            daughters were purposely fitted to keep such schools in which the
                            alphabet, spelling, and primary reading were taught along with the
                            catechism, and in which girls learned to sew. "Mary goes to Mrs. Thair's

                            were themselves unable to read, but who taught the children the
                            catechism <pb id="VAA2405-223" n="212"/> only, and that orally. Nothing
                            so bad as this is recorded of English schools of the sort, but the dame
                            was, no doubt, sometimes poorly qualified even to give instruction as
                            far as the primer.</p>

                            was thought to require an overlay of a thin bit of horn to protect it

                            lower-case letters, with those easy syllables in two letters known at
                            least in later days as the "a b abs" The alphabet had been from remote
                            times preceded by a cross, from which the first line had come to be
                            called the crisscross (or Christ's cross) row. The advent of
                            Protestantism did not drive out all Catholic usages; some English

                            </note> The device is well known in our later times. There were of old
                            "latten abeesees" as well as English ones; the Latin were no doubt the
                            more ancient. The primer, notwithstanding its name, was the third
                            implement for learning put into the hands of a child. It contained at
                            the Reformation prayers and religious meditations, but in some of its
                            later forms it was much like a modern catechism. The primer came at last
                            to include the contents of the hornbook and the "abcie"; such was the
                            famous New England Primer which had its rise at the close of the
                            seventeenth and passed through innumerable editions in the eighteenth
                            century. The usual course was to pass the child out of the primer into
                            the psalterthat is, to set him to reading Sternhold and Hopkins's
                            version of the Psalms in meter. The rugged Bay Psalm Book was used as a
                            reader in the days when <pb id="VAA2405-225" n="214"/> approximate
                            rhymes and a rough rhythm were the only alleviations of the child's
                            task. But reading was also taught from little books "full of precepts of
                            ciuilitie" done into verse "such as children will soone learne and take
                            delight in thorow the roundnesse of the meter," as Schoolmaster Brinsley

                            ignorant of numbers; some boys advanced in Latin did not know the
                            numerals, Roman or Arabic, and could not find the chapter in the Bible,
                            "much less the verse." The boy from the grammar school had learned to
                            write and to make his own quill pens with the point next the middle
                            finger slightly thinner and shorter than the other, and to make a ruling
                            pen as well, "with a nock like that of an arrow." With this he could
                            make two parallel lines, and he ruled his own paper thus and wrote
                            between the two lines. "Penne, inke, paper, rular, plummet, ruling pen,
                            pen-knife," were all included in the outfit for learning to write, and
                            there was "a blotting paper" to keep the book clean. For doing his
                            exercises the pupil used a piece of lead thrust into a quill, and he
                            kept a piece of new <pb id="VAA2405-228" n="217"/> wheat bread at hand

                            scholar used his Flores Poetarum for models, and he could borrow elegant
                            ready-made locutions from a thesaurus of poetical phrases by Bucklerius.
                            The Sylva Synonimorum was also very handy for "schollars of Judgement."
                            When the word in mind would not scan properly, the verse carpenter could
                            select another with the same meaning from this Forest of Synonyms. The
                            ambitious young poet rummaged in Textor's Epitheta after decorative
                            adjectives; for epithets, "if they be choyse, are a singular ornament,"
                            as Master Brinsley assures us. "Descriptions by periphrases" were to be
                            had in Holyoke's Dictionary, and there was "Master Draxe his Phrases"
                            and other books "to see how many wayes they can vtter anything in good

                            because its nine words could be arranged in a hundred and four ways,

                            Latin were sent to the writing school to learn "good hands and
                            accounts." In these schools were taught an elaborate penmanship,

                            complicated and intricated in that day by the multitude of varying

                            dramatically after the manner of the time. A mysterious well-dressed
                            stranger appeared in the open court of the Virginia Company, depositing

                            the Indians. Passengers on a returning East Indiaman, hearing news of
                            religious destitution in Virginia, forthwith collected money; this, with
                            other sums, was devoted to the founding of a collegiate school at

                            clergy, such as they were, were imported ready made, and whose laymen at
                            least did their talking and reading in mother English. The College of
                            William and Mary did not get under way until the last years of the
                            seventeenth century; there was no bishop on this side of the sea to
                            induct men into holy orders; the primitive statecraft of the colony
                            needed no other tongue than the vernacular, aided occasionally by Indian
                            interpreters, so that the free Latin school of early Virginia was a
                            short ladder with nothing but empty space at the top of it. Latin was
                            studied merely as a gentleman's accomplishment. The abundant wild land,
                            the cheap bondservant labor, and yet cheaper slave labor, which became
                            common in the last quarter of the century, tempted the young provincial
                            of the Chesapeake colonies to land ownership and that culture of the
                            soil by the hands of others that had been for ages the pursuit of the
                            gentry of the mother country. Of the character of the teaching in the
                            few early Virginia grammar schools we know nothing. Little private
                            schools early began to spring up at convenient points in the growing
                            settlements which <pb id="VAA2405-234" n="223"/> were stretched in a
                            narrow, sinuous line along the margins of the watercourses and estuaries
                            of the Chesapeake region. One may infer from the record that there were
                            such schools before 1644, and it appears that the cost of a year's

                        <p>The schools in Virginia being thus the offspring of the law of demand and
                            supply, some of the endowed schools seem to have taught arithmetic
                            instead of the dead languages, and one excellent private school in 1724
                            combined numbers with Latin and Greek. Virginia life in the first
                            century after the settlement was extremely rural, not to say rustic;
                            most of the planters had never seen a <pb id="VAA2405-235" n="224"/>
                            town, and even members of the House of Burgesses could not conceive of
                            life as tolerable to people cooped up in a village where neighbors were
                            so near that there was no range for a herd of cattle. The development of
                            large landholdings began to produce a class of pretty rich planters in
                            the last half of the seventeenth century who naturally wished to give
                            their sons better advantages than they could get in the rough old field
                            schools or the struggling free schools.<note id="note_703" place="left"

                            probably earlier, and it seems to have prevailed in the Chesapeake
                            region throughout the colonial period. No doubt some of the teachers who
                            emigrated in considerable numbers in the prevalent fashion at the cost
                            of a temporary loss of liberty were better instructed than many of the
                            ordinary country teachers of the time. Before 1683 the brilliant William
                            Byrd, who was perhaps the first man born in any of the colonies with a
                            natural gift for felicitous literary expression, had been sent to
                            England for education. As time went on, this recurrence to the sources
                            of learning in the Old World was frequent among the rich in the Southern
                            colonies.</p>

                            </note> In the Puritan mind preaching was really a sacrament above
                            sacraments, though it was called "an ordinance." God was held to be
                            present "in his holy ordinances" when they had "binn setled in a way of
                            gospel order." It became therefore a matter of primary importance to
                            educate preachers. For ages preparation for the ministry had consisted
                            mainly in acquiring a knowledge of Latin, the sacred tongue of Western
                            Christendom. Though the Latin service was no longer used by Protestants,
                            and the Vulgate Bible had been dethroned by the original text, and
                            though the main stream of English theology was by this time flowing in
                            the channel of the mother tongue, the notion that all ministers should
                            know Latin had still some centuries of tough life in it. The first
                            professed aim of university and secondary education in that time was to
                            raise up ministers; to fit men for the service of the state followed
                            close after. In all early projects for schools and colleges in America
                            these two were somewhat grotesquely intertwined, with a notion that a
                            first step toward converting the heathen tribes was to make some of them
                            bachelors of art. For this purpose the endowment <pb id="VAA2405-237"
                                n="226"/> of the abortive Henrico College was undertaken in
                            Virginia, and in 1666, after no little travail, Harvard succeeded in
                            graduating an Indian.</p>

                            apparently out of a fund produced by the sale of indigent children sent

                            into the modern system. In some New England communities the school tax

                            religious color in the eyes of the people of that day. Massachusetts
                            ordained in 1642 that every child should be taught enough "to read and
                            understand the principles of religion &amp; the capitall laves of
                            the country." The preamble of the Massachusetts school law of 1647 makes
                            it the motive of the act to thwart "the ould deluder Satan" by keeping
                            the Scriptures accessible in the original tongues, that "the true Sence
                            and meaning" might not "be clouded by false glosses of saint seeming
                            deceivers." This law passed into the Connecticut code of 1650, preceded
                            by this preamble with its uncouth rhetoric; the old deluder Satan still
                            marches at the front, followed by the Papists, the saint-seeming
                            deceivers walking softly in the rear, "false glosses" in hand. The broad
                            and secular uses of education were not recognized as yet.</p>

                            </note> The rush of Puritan immigration had virtually ceased about 1640,
                            and the attention of the New England leaders was turned toward the
                            thronging children in the prolific families of the settlers. The
                            religious Utopia, such as the founders had imagined when they heard the
                            voice of the Lord calling upon them to arise and depart out of the land
                            of their fathers, was to be realized by the children born in these ends
                            of the earth." As early as 1642 there was alarm at the educational
                            decline. Before 1645 there were agitations in favor of free schools in
                            New Haven, Dedham, Roxbury, and other towns. In 1644 the Commissioners
                            of the United Colonies of New England bestirred themselves to collect a
                            peck of corn from each family for Harvard College, that the supply of
                            preachers might not fail. But the graduates of Harvard were now finding
                            benefices in England, where, since the rise of the Puritans to power,
                            ministers with Puritan antecedents were much sought after. In 1646 the
                            Massachusetts General Court sadly confesses "the fewness of persons
                            accomplished to such imployments" as required education, and looks to
                            the future with something like consternation. Six years later the
                            records testify that Harvard students "as soone as they are growne vpp,
                            ready for public vse... leave the country." Meantime "the first founders
                            weare away apace." It was in the face of this disheartening exigency
                            that the school law of 1647 was adopted.</p>

                        <p>This law, which has produced such far-reaching and unforeseen results,
                            was confessedly a dam against the rising tide of ignorance. It was
                            passed "that learning may not be buried in the grave of our fathers in
                            the church and commonwealth." It ordained "that every township in this
                            iurisdiction, after the Lord hath increased them to the number of fifty
                            householders, shall then forth-with appointe one within their towne to
                            teach to write and to reade." This ungrammatical sentence is the vital
                            part of the law. Towns having a hundred householders were to establish
                            grammar schools to teach Latin, or to pay a fine to the nearest towns
                            having such a school. This provision for grammar schools, as the
                            preamble implies, was intended to be the capital feature of the law, but
                            it could not be enforced. On the other hand, the rude little schools for
                            mere reading and writing, to be taught usually by some resident farmer,
                            were possible in a new country, and they were realized in many townships
                            during the next half century. Those country schools that pretended to
                            the dignity of grammar schools were most of them shams or makeshifts to
                            satisfy the law by such devices as covenanting that an incompetent
                            master should teach Latin "as far as he was able," or that he should
                            "teach English and carry them on in Latin as far as he could." Even
                            where the teacher was fairly competent those desiring Latin came to be

                            rudimentary schools a law could not achieve much. Townships might have
                            something less than fifty householders with perhaps a hundred and fifty
                            children, and yet have no school. One school in a territory of six or
                            eight miles square was but a lean provision. Considering the number of
                            voluntary schools already in existence the first effect of the law must
                            have been slight indeed. Popular education under its provisions was
                            rough and scant, as the surviving documents of the succeeding age
                            testify all unconsciously. No new kind of school was introduced by the
                            act, and the question of support was still left with each township, "as
                            the maior part of those that order the prudentials of the towne shall
                            appoint." Its importance lay in the requirement by a central authority
                            that each local community of a certain population should sustain a
                            school in some way, and its historical value consists in the principle
                            thus established. The outcome of this law adopted, in what was the most
                            religious as it was the most intolerant period of New England history,
                            has been the development of a national system of secular education for
                            many millions of children professing nearly every creed known in the
                            wide world.</p>

                            invent; necessity rarely brings forth anything better than imitation and
                            adaptation. What makes the school act of 1647 of consequence is the
                            legal obligation imposed on local communities to provide opportunity for
                            education. For this England afforded no example. But New England was
                            quite as likely to fetch a precedent from some Presbyterian country as
                            to follow the tradition of England. She did not need to go farther than
                            to Scotland. At the Reformation Knox desired "to purge the Churche of
                            God from all superstition" and to disseminate the new doctrines in the
                            remotest corners of Scotland. In his Buke of Discipline he demanded
                            "That everie severall churche have a schoolmaister appointed, such a one
                            as is able at least to teach Grammar and the Latin tung, yf the Town be
                            of any reputation. Yf it be upaland... then must either the Reider or
                            the Minister take cayre over the children... to instruct them in their
                            first rudimentie and especially in the catechisme." Knox proposed this
                            system sixty-seven years before the law of 1647; in both we have the
                            same Latin schools in larger towns and rudimentary teaching in obscurer
                            places. The Synod of Dort repeated the attempt in Holland in 1618.
                            Knox's scheme and the Dutch imitation of it were but an expansion of the
                            parish and cathedral schools existing for centuries before.</p>

                        <p>The educational decline in all the colonies was inevitable and it was
                            universal as we may see by the extant letters, wills, and records
                            painfully written by men of the second and third generations. The
                            violent aberrations of orthography from even the rather free standards
                            of the time, the vagrant capital letters, the halting and confused march
                            of sentences, suggest that brains, as well as hands, were numbed by the
                            rude toil from which pioneers may not escape. The trees of the forest
                            were a hostile phalanx to be broken, fields beset with stumps that
                            defied the plow were to be subdued to culture; there were savages to
                            fight and to flee from, towns and ships to build, with tasks of Hercules
                            beside that left small room for learning. Frontiersmen find the Latin
                            accidence dispensable. The generations of bad spellers and clumsy
                            writers born to a new-world battle were much better trained for their
                            environment than the most accomplished of the first corners. They had
                            learned from boyhood to take bearings and lay a true course through
                            labyrinthine woods, to handle with steady sureness the heavy firelock
                            musket or the newer snaphance, and the long-barreled fowling piece, to
                            swing true the felling axe, and to wield the heavy beetle, to hew a
                            puncheon floor, to build a cabin of rough logs. They could balance and
                            paddle on salt water and fresh in wind and wild weather the tottling
                            canoe. Patience, courage, enterprise, and <note id="note_723"

                            result from such a curriculum. But these men hardly knew more of
                            literature than did the Greek heroes or the Hebrew patriarchs. In the
                            rather well-written manuscript records of Virginia parishes of that time
                            "the clarkes" record that the vestry "has made choyse on" one R. M. for
                            a church warden; that the parson has "affeciated"; that A. B. has been
                            "opoynted overseyear" of the highways; processioning of bounds is
                            spelled "persestioning," sufficient is "sofitiant," and so on. It is
                            entered that a certain person has been "making his redress to this
                            vestry for helpe." A Maryland vestry clerk had no notion of mental
                            reservation; he records that the vestrymen took the oath of abjuration
                            "without equivocation or governmentall reservation." In New England it
                            is amusingly pathetic to read the records of covenants with teachers
                            written by town clerks who doubled the n in English or stipulated that
                            the pupils should learn to "rite" or "wright." The awkward pronunciation
                            of the pioneer scribe shows through his phonetic spelling when those to
                            be taught appear as "childeringe," and one of the three r's in a
                            contract with a teacher is sometimes "refinetick," sometimes
                            "retmitick." Even the Boston clerk of 1652 bewrays his speech when he
                            writes of the "pore scollers of Hervert College." Local government has
                            its petty side; the New England towns had "tricks and shifts to evade
                            the school laws." Few towns escaped fine for neglect of, <note

                            towns there were children that traveled long roads to school; in one
                            case it was eight miles. In New England, as in Virginia, many children
                            learned to read in the old English way by home instruction. In Virginia
                            the ability to read was perhaps about as common as in England at the
                            same period, but there are cases of a man holding local office who was
                            obliged to make his "signum" or mark in subscribing to a document; in
                            Andover, Mass., in 1664, five out of eleven on a coroner's jury made
                            marks. In other colonies than Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Virginia
                            there was yet greater illiteracy. In Maryland half the adult males were
                            probably unable to write their names during the whole seventeenth
                            century. Harvard College ran down in the general decline. "The greater
                            part of the people were devoted to the Plow," as a writer of the time
                            explains, and "learning was forced to plod out a way to live." In the
                            last quarter of the seventeenth century Harvard was a Latin and divinity
                            school, slim in attendance, and inefficient in teaching, while it was
                            kicked about as a political football in the strife between the factions

                            legacy for the futurea system of schools sustained in part by enforced
                            local taxation. The school that survived "the dark ages" of New England
                            was no longer that brought from England. Supported partly by town rates
                            the so-called Latin school was less able even than the English school to
                            resist the intrusion of younger children. Such pupils gave trouble at
                            Harvard, and at New Haven they "bothered the master of the grammar
                            school by learning to spell English." Yielding to the demand of
                            supporters, grammar schools came to give more attention to writing and
                            arithmetic. But this innovation was admitted grudgingly at first. "It is
                            scarce known in any place to have a free school for English and writing"
                            was the objection raised in New Haven, but even New Haven only grumbled
                            in yielding, and so by slow degrees it came to pass that the English
                            studies at last drove the sacred Latin from the free school founded at
                            first for it alone. In vain did the town meeting exhort the master to
                            "bring his boys on to latting as fast as they were capable." Latin
                            teaching barely survived at all by the aid of such hortation and of
                            repeated legislation, local and general. Other important changes came by
                            the irresistible pressure of circumstances. The remoter townsmen were
                            taxpayers also, and they tired of sending their children over weary
                            miles of snowdrifts to the township <note id="note_732"

                            as time went on "outskirt schools" grew up. In many cases, over the
                            whole region covered by township communities the schools were rotated so
                            as to be kept first in one neighborhood and then in another. In the
                            eighteenth century we find New Jersey appointing men to look after the
                            schools, and see that they rotated properly, so that all the inhabitants
                            might have a fair chance. By such processes the town school gradually
                            became the modern district school. An obligation to establish and to
                            support schools, in part at least, from the public fund having once
                            become traditional, one finds in the eighteenth century even dame
                            schools and many writing schools maintained in part or wholly at public
                            expense. Taking our stand at the point where the half-medival
                            seventeenth gives place to the far more modern eighteenth century, we
                            can see that the thousand-year-old exclusive instruction of the few was
                            in process of slow transformation into a scheme of popular and universal
                            education. As usual in such a metamorphosis, the change was made by
                            insensible gradations; the continuity was without apparent seam.</p>

                            freely tolerating more than one form of religious belief could do little
                            or nothing by state initiative for education; and in communities where
                            there was a division of sentiment voluntary co-operation in schools was
                            almost impossible. In Maryland the poor little arts of reading and
                            writing were hardly known in some parts of the province, and it has been
                            estimated that in the seventeenth century half of the adult males were
                            unable to write their names. There were efforts to establish schools in
                            the lifetime of the first generation; these were kept by one Ralphe
                            Crouch, who was in some way connected with the Jesuits. Thirty-seven
                            years after the first settlement the Catholic upper House of the
                            Legislature proposed to found a government school, but the Protestant
                            lower House promptly barricaded the way by proposing as a condition that
                            all the teachers should be Protestants or that there should be at least
                            one Protestant master in the school. The notion of a wholly secular and
                            impartial rudimentary instruction had not entered the minds of men in
                            any part of Christendom. One of those "schools for humanities" for which
                            the Jesuit order was famous was begun "in the center of the country" in
                            1677, but without aid from the Maryland government. Rhode Island was
                            similarly embarrassed, and there is no mention of schools in the early
                            colony records. There were schools nevertheless. The early New England

                            a retardation of educational development was the natural penalty of
                            religious impartiality. One of the results of the English Revolution of
                            1688 was to make Maryland for a while a crown colony and rather
                            intensely Protestant. In 1692 and in years following laws were passed
                            for the promotion of "free schools" of the old Latin school kind,
                            intended to produce candidates for holy orders who were to complete

                        <p>By comparison of such notices as we have of American schools with the
                            English schools of the period, we can form a fairly clear conception of
                            the outward traits of school life in the age of American settlement. We
                            may dimly see the unwilling boy "with shining morning face" and a
                            lambskin satchel setting out for school, breakfastless, in the dark
                            winter mornings in time to begin his studies at the unchristian hour of
                            six o'clock. Some schools postponed the hour of beginning until seven.
                            The session ended at eleven, when the famished pupils went home to their
                            first meal, though in a few schools there was a recess of fifteen

                            There was a custom in earlier times of allowing the fasting pupils to
                            take some light food in school with bottles of drink, but if the custom
                            survived into the seventeenth century it left no trace in educational
                            literature. The session was resumed for the afternoon when the master
                            rapped on the doorpost at one o'clock, and it continued until "well-nigh
                            six at night," when the scholars, who must have been stupefied by an
                            all-day confinement, heard the welcome word of dismission, "Exeatis." In
                            a new country the rough roads and long distances must have made it next
                            to impossible to begin in the dark at six in the winter. By 1719 the
                            hour had fallen away in one place to "three quarters past seven." One
                            finds the pupils of Christopher Dock, the Pennsylvania Dutch teacher,
                            munching their "breakfast bread" along the road as they hurried to
                            school at some unearthly time, and back-country schools in America
                            retained cruelly long hours, with other cherished and venerable abuses
                            brought from Europe, until the middle of the nineteenth century. In the
                            early years of Harvard an hour was allowed at some time in the middle of
                            the forenoon for morning bever, a light snack preceded by no breakfast.
                            Half an hour was given to the afternoon bever, and an hour and a half
                            each to dinner and supper. Small allowance was made for the activity of
                            youth. There were no regular recesses for play <note id="note_745"

                            great man would lend his countenance to the school by a formal visit; at
                            such a time he might crave a little grace for the prisoners of learning;
                            a half holiday was granted at his request and in honor of his advent.
                            Such playtimes were of old called "remedyes," but austere Dean Colet
                            would not allow to the pupils of his new fountlation of St. Paul's a
                            playday at the request of anybody less than a king or a prelate. It was
                            thought best to cut off this ancient privilege wholly at the little
                            Virginia college; there were probably too many visitors of distinction;
                            but one afternoon a month was set apart for play, and whenever a new
                            student was enrolled "an afternoon extraordinary " was granted, "and no

                        <p>On a certain day in 1563, during the prevalence of "the fever pestilence"
                            in London, there sat at dinner in Secretary Cecil's chamber at Windsor
                            Castle a group of distinguished men. Cecil turned the table talk to the
                            recent flight of some lads from the neighboring school of Eton "for fear
                            of beating," and condemned the harshness of schoolmasters. There were in
                            the company of course some of those conservatives who rise up to defend
                            any old-fashioned practice. But, as good luck would have it, there sat
                            among the dignitaries of state Roger Ascham, the archery-loving,
                            cock-fighting, learned and gifted schoolmaster, who <note id="note_751"

                            Greek with the young Queen Elizabeth one of the orations of Demosthenes.
                            Without title or political position it is fair to suppose that he sat
                            far down near the foot of the table; but Cecil encouraged him to speak
                            to the question, and Ascham gave his opinion strongly and no doubt
                            eloquently against the barbarity of schoolmasters. Dinner ended, Sir
                            Richard Sackville, who had held his peace while the debate went on, led
                            Ascham away to a window for private speech with him. Sackville confessed
                            to Ascham that the beatings of a "lewde Schoolmaster" had brought him to
                            hate learning before he was fourteen years old. He entreated the queen's
                            schoolmaster to write out what he had just spoken at the table. By this
                            conversation Ascham was set on writing his famous work The Scholemaster.
                            But neither the authority of Ascham nor of any other could at once abate
                            the unsparing severity of school discipline which was popularly believed
                            to be eminently beneficial to boys and of scriptural authority. Thomas
                            Becon, the reformer, had complained that schoolmasters beat their pupils
                            "like stock-fishes." Mulcaster, the successor of Ascham, had no
                            hesitation about flogging; he speaks somewhat gayly of "my lady
                            birchely." Brinsley, the able and zealous advocate of school reform in
                            the reign of James I, suggests several practical ways of avoiding brutal
                            punishments, such as the use of rewards, and the keeping of a "black
                            bill," or, <note id="note_755" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">

                            unlucky scholars set down in this list were to be deprived of their rare
                            playtimes. But even the humane Brinsley did not once dream of sparing
                            the rod for serious offenders; he thought "ferula" a necessary remedy
                            for bad Latin, and he used what he calls "little ierkes "with a small
                            switch of red willow." When little jerks with little switches would not
                            serve, he recommends more serious flogging; the young rebel to be held
                            over a form or up against a post "by three or four of his fellows,"
                            making sure "to hold him fast as they are enforced to do who are to
                            shove or tame an vnbroken colt." This was the method of a conscientious
                            and humane master; the brutalities of the unfeeling are not pleasant to
                            imagine. There were others than Sir Richard Sackville who cursed some
                            "lewde schoolmaster" for a failure to get learning, and some who
                            attributed deafness to blows received in school. It's a general plague
                            and complaint of the whole land," writes Peacham, "that for one discreet
                            and able teacher you shall find twenty ignorant and carelesse." The
                            first master at Harvard went too far even for that age; it is not
                            certain that he would have been dismissed for his barbarous punishment
                            of students and the exceedingly short commons on which he fed them, but
                            when he ferociously drubbed even his usher, beating him mercilessly with
                            a hickory stick while two of his servants held the man fast, he lost his
                            place, and set on <note id="note_756" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">

                            mild; at Eton fifty-three stripes are recorded as given for a trivial
                            fault at an earlier period, and the young John Milton had to suffer a
                            beating from his tutor at Cambridge not very long before this. At

                            a contract with a teacher, but it was always understood that children
                            were boys only, girls did not count. There were no girls in the schools
                            sustained by towns or by endowment at the period of American settlement.
                            To read her Bible and psalm-book devoutly and to use her needle deftly
                            were the only necessary accomplishments for a woman, and these could be
                            got in a dame school or at home. The illiterate "her mark "is signed to

                        <p>An English writer recommends the middle of the day for teaching writing,
                            because the fingers would then be warmer and nimbler, which suggests
                            schoolrooms with no fire. In New England one finds the summer school
                            sometimes kept in "the unfinished room" of a house which is spoken of as
                            though a room unfinished was a normal part of a new-country house. The
                            kitchen of a dwelling, with its great fireplace, was sometimes made a
                            schoolroom in winter, or in its stead the "parlor"; the best room
                            reserved for weddings and funerals, on which occasions the bare floor
                            would be neatly strewn with sand. Even where there was a schoolhouse, as
                            at Dedham in 1658, the schoolmaster was allowed to assemble the school
                            in his own house "if the weather be extreme and unfit to travaill." In
                            that climate there early grew up a custom of exacting a half cord or a
                            "Wayne load of wood for fewell" for each pupil. This was to be delivered
                            at the schoolhouse in November, for no man of English origin in the
                            first two or three generations after settlement knew that wood could be
                            drawn much more easily on sleds over the snow.</p>

                        <p>The direct influence in America of the advanced education of the
                            seventeenth century was not great. No one with any sense of historic
                            perspective will believe that the university men who lived or sojourned
                            in Virginia in the early seventeenth century had any traceable relation
                            to the group of Virginia statesmen that grew as from a congenial soil in
                            the later eighteenth; it is equally fanciful to suppose that the
                            existence of a considerable body of Cambridge men in early New England
                            had anything to do with producing the literary forwardness of that
                            region two hundred years later. But the university ideals of the time
                            influenced directly the course of thought in the new provinces. Logic
                            was the main study in all higher institutions, and the logic bequeathed
                            by the schoolmen meant merely incessant practice of the art of
                            dialectical disputation as a means of acquiring universal truth. In
                            sermons and in conversation this verbal sword play was much affected and
                            it, rendered the wits nimble. But this highly valued "Aristotelian
                            method" had for ages retarded the advance toward larger learning and
                            broader views. Milton's disappointment in the university was great, and
                            his contempt for its studies is delightfully Miltonic if not always
                            discriminating. In his vehement complaint he ransacks "lofts of pild
                            thunder" for missiles with which to assail the curriculum of his time.
                            It is "a pure trifling at grammar and sophistry," "an <note

                        <p>In 1636 the Massachusetts General Court voted two hundred pounds toward
                            "a schoole or colledge," and the next year selected Newton, the present
                            Cambridge, as the place for it. This proposition might have proved as
                            futile as the early proposals for a college in Virginia had it not been
                            that John Harvard, a minister, dying in 1638, left a legacy for the
                            proposed institution which thus had the breath of life breathed into it
                            and became Harvard College. It was established on the most religious
                            plan possible. The study of divinity was made the chief end of a
                            student, prayer and religious consecration were prescribed academic

                            first degree was a student's ability to render the Old and New
                            Testaments out of Hebrew and Greek into Latin "and to resolve them
                            logically." For the second degree a summary knowledge of logic, natural
                            and moral philosophy, arithmetic, geometry, and astronomy were added.
                            There was here a slender recognition of mathematics in advance of the
                            English universities. The modes of study seem to have been mechanical
                            after the manner of the time. In the earlier years of the college each
                            student was accustomed to transcribe for himself certain treatises in
                            manuscript on logic and other studies made by Alexander Richardson of
                            Oxford. In examining the list of subjects for graduating theses we are
                            now and then refreshed by the intrusion of a question that has to do
                            with human progress; the question of the circulation of the blood was
                            discussed in 1660, and was again mooted in 1699, more than seventy years
                            after Harvey had announced his discovery. For the most part the themes
                            with which college graduates in that day busied themselves are
                            grotesquely futile as, "whether privation is the cause of anything in
                            Nature," "whether genus exists out-side of intellect," and "whether a
                            shadow moves." Behold philosophy! It was proved at Harvard commencements
                            by reasoners with youth and courage on their side that the starry heaven
                            is made of fire; that there is a stone which produces gold; and that the
                            quadrature of the circle is possible.</p>

                        <p>After the Restoration Virginia began to feel an alarm like that which had
                            startled Massachusetts earlier. It is probable that the deprived
                            churchmen who occupied Virginia parishes during the Commonwealth were
                            now returning to England to reap the reward of their fidelity to the
                            king. It was feared that the "want of able &amp; faithful Ministers"
                            would deprive the colonists of "those great Blessings and Mercies that
                            allwaies attend upon the Service of God," and the Assembly passed an act
                            in 1661, and again in 1662, to found "a colledge and free schoole." But
                            Sir William Berkeley, the governor, did not want either a college or a
                            free school, and Berkeley, with a salary independent of the good will of
                            the people, was more absolute in Virginia than his master Charles was in
                            England. This pinchbeck Stuart detested ministers who were able to
                            preach, and he abhorred printing presses. But the Virginia educational
                            movement at the time of the Restoration was not <note id="note_772"

                            subscription for the college was ever taken, it probably was not
                            collected, and the "houseing "ordered to be erected for the college is
                            not again heard of. But at least two bequests to found new free schools
                            were made in Berkeley's depressing reign. After the disorders and
                            despotisms which followed the failure of Nathaniel Bacon's bold stroke
                            for freedom in 1676 had passed away, a college subscription was set on
                            foot in 1688 and 1689, and sums amounting to twenty-five hundred pounds
                            were promised by wealthy Virginians and a few English merchants. The
                            confusion resulting from the English Revolution of 1688 probably caused
                            delay. Two years more elapsed before the Assembly took action by
                            ordaining an institution in three departmentsa grammar school, a school
                            of philosophy, and a school of Oriental languages and divinity. A
                            charter was secured from the sovereigns. William and Mary, whose names
                            the college took, gave freely out of the wild lands of the province, out
                            of the royal revenues from tobacco, and gave outright the income from
                            the fees for surveying land. The Virginia Assembly added an import duty
                            on furs. In 1700, while the building designed by Sir Christopher Wren
                            was yet unfinished, the college at the close of its first year held a
                            commencement. The novelty of such an exercise attracted a large
                            concourse of people to the new town of Williamsburg. Some of the great
                            planters came in coaches, which vehicles were yet rare enough <note

                            visitors arrived in their own sloops, sailing in some instances from the
                            upper waters of the Chesapeake, and in other cases on the op n ocean
                            from Pennsylvania and New York. Some even of the Indians gathered their
                            blankets round them and strolled into the little capital to lend
                            picturesqueness to this powwow of white men. The opening of an infant
                            college was a notable break in the rather eventless monotony of a
                            half-settled coast, remote from the great world.</p>
                        <p>The so-called college, thus hopefully launched, drifted inevitably into
                            the whirlpools and eddies of petty provincial politics; its revenues
                            were a tempting bait to the ring of predatory colonial magnates and
                            ambitious sycophants that surrounded a royal governor in that day.
                            William and Mary College was but a grammar school for years after its
                            start, and its development was tediously slow. But most of its resources
                            were saved from plunder and waste, and at the outbreak of the Revolution
                            it was said to be the richest institution of learning in Americafor all
                            of which it was primarily indebted to a single man.</p>

                            the project by the Assembly and governor in Virginia, by the king and

                            philosopher, and by the executors of Robert Boyle, there is the moving
                            hand of James Blair, one of the most pertinacious men ever born in a
                            land of obstinate pertinacity. Having seen the subscription well made up
                            in Virginia, Blair went to England in 1691 with a commission from the
                            Assembly to procure the best charter possible and a royal endowment. The
                            traditions of the court were dead against him. The government of Charles
                            II had made a point of discouraging in Virginia printing presses,
                            education, and other influences that unfit people for docile submission
                            to tyranny. The colony was to buy English wares, to swell the customs
                            revenues by producing the heavily taxed tobacco, and to buy negroes from
                            the Royal African Company, in which not only great courtiers but royalty
                            itself had held shares. When Blair argued the need of a college for the
                            sake of the souls of the people, Seymour, the attorney general, replied
                            contemptuously, "Damn your souls, make tobacco!" A less contentious man
                            than Blair would have given up and gone home, a man less canny and
                            persistent must have failed. He contrived to secure William's attention
                            in the midst of the exigent affairs of a critical time, and he managed
                            to gain the support of both the sovereigns. His manuvres were worthy of

                            Mary herself with skill, and won his suit handsomely. He carried back a
                            charter for a <hi rend="i">studium generate,</hi> a place of universal
                            study. After his return he fought triumphantly with petty courtiers and
                            successive governors, breaking Sir Edmund Andros himself, who had
                            contrived to survive for many years the infamy of a great variety of
                            disgraceful conduct in his various governments. Dr. Blair was a man of
                            versatile ability; his printed sermons passed through several editions,
                            and he held his place as bishop's commissary at the head of the Virginia
                            clergy for half a century. His discipline was mild, and he fought the
                            battles of his order against encroachments, but his clergy disliked and
                            opposed him. He resisted the oppressions of the royal governors, but the
                            people were never attracted to him. He had no arts of conciliation, and
                            he had no lubricating humor. He delighted to carry a measure by mere
                            push of pike, and to his contemporaries he was a bundle of pugnacities.
                            Every man born north of the Tweed was an object of prejudice, and Blair
                            was accused, moreover, of having received nothing better than a
                            Presbyterian ordination. Though no one seems to have questioned his
                            honesty, it was complained that he "had large worldly concerns." He
                            lived to an advanced age, and died rich in a land where many thriftless
                            and often dissipated parsons got on but meanly. He was one of the chief
                            benefactors of a colony that never showed him, young or old, living or
                                <pb id="VAA2405-265" n="254"/> dead, the slightest gratitude of
                            which there is any record. A single noble legacy made the obscure John
                            Harvard immortal, but fifty years of resolute service and a liberal
                            legacy to the college brought no honors to the founder of William and
                            Mary. A good and public-spirited man, he was personally unlikable. But
                            had Blair been less rugged, there might have been no "College Royal of
                            William and Mary."</p>

                        <p>At the end of the seventeenth century there were efficient beginnings of
                            higher education only in Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Virginia. New
                            York was too much divided by the various nationalities of its people and
                            too deeply interested in a trade reaching from Lake Ontario to the
                            pirate settlements of Madagascar to have advanced beyond rudimentary
                            schools. Pennsylvania and the Carolinas were too new, Maryland and Rhode
                            Island too much subdivided in religion, and the eastward settlements of
                            New England were too backward in development. Massachusetts had firmly
                            established a college destined to an illustrious career, Connecticut was
                            about to start into the new century with her Yale College, and Virginia
                            was flushed with hope of a time when the grammar school at Williamsburg
                            should grow into "a certaine place of universall study," as its charter
                            proposed. These small beginnings were enough to mark the persistence in

                        <p>"In the same year of our Lord's incarnation, 664," says Bede, "a sudden
                            pestilence... ravaged the country far and near... This pestilence did no
                            less harm in the island of Ireland. Many of the nobility and of the
                            lower ranks of the English nation were there at that time,... either for
                            the sake of Divine studies or of a more continent life; and some of them
                            presently devoted themselves to a monastic life, others chose rather to
                            apply themselves to study, going about from one master's cell to
                            another. "Egbert, one of the Englishmen among the Culdees in Ireland,
                            succeeded in escaping from the plague by vowing that he would say the
                            whole psalter daily to the praise of God, and that he would every week
                            fast one whole day and night. The account of his austerities in Bede,
                            book iii, chap. xxvii, throws light on the ideals of life taught in the
                            monasteries of the seventh century. In Tanner's Notitia Monastica he
                            says of the Culdees: "The ancient British, Irish, and Saxon Monasteries,
                            we find, were Schools and Universities of those times; they were not
                            only Cells of Devotion, but also Nurseries of Learned Men for the use of
                            the Church." To imagine anything like modern school or university
                            instruction or learning in the monasteries of that early age would be
                            misleading. In the Catholic monasteries and cathedral establishments
                            organization was perhaps more perfect than among the Culdees. We get a
                            view of higher and lower instruction as already established in a canon
                            of A. D. 747, number 7, in Johnson's Ecclesiastical Laws. Some curious
                            traits of the schools in the houses of the priests may be deduced from

                            the Danish wars," says Tanner, "an universal ignorance overspread the
                            land, insomuch that there was scarce any one in England that could read
                            or write Latin. But when, by the care of King Edgar and Archbishop
                            Dunstan, Monasteries were restored, Learning found its former
                            encouragement." Preface to Notitia Monastica. Fitzstephen relates that
                            there were famous schools in three principal churches of London in the
                            twelfth century. Furnivall cites a saying of Roger Bacon that there were
                            schools in every city, town, burgh, and castle in the thirteenth
                            century. Compare also Wright's Domestic Manners and Sentiments in the
                            Middle Ages, 338 and ff. There is evidence of the survival of the
                            teaching of children by the mass priest in the action of the corporation
                            of Bridgenorth. When a more modern "Comyn Scole" was substituted at the
                            beginning of the sixteenth century, a by-law was adopted which ordained
                            that "there schall no priste kepe no scole save oonly oon child to helpe
                            hym to sey masse." MSS. Commission, x, part iv, 425. There is an
                            instance as late as Mary's reign of the restoration of an ancient
                            endowment by town lands for the support of a priest "Habill to teache
                            Grammar." Ibid., 533. In Collier's Ecclesiastical History, part ii, book
                            iii, 165 (Lathbury's edition, vol. v, 29), we read: "The abbeys were
                            very serviceable places for the education of young people; every convent
                            had one person or more assigned for this business. Thus the children of
                            the neighborhood were taught [Latin] grammar and music without any
                            charge to their parents: and in the nunneries those of the other sex
                            learned to work and read English, with some advances into Latin." Stow,
                            in his Survey of London, notes that the Lateran Council in 1176
                            recognized cathedral schools, but in the Capitularies of Theodolf they
                            are carried back to the end of the eighth century, and were, beyond
                            doubt, still older. Johnson's Ecclesiastical Laws, 994, 19. Down to the
                            end of the tenth century almost the only seminaries in Charlemagne's
                            dominions appear to have been in cathedrals and convents. First Report
                            of Cathedral Commission, xxv. It is to be noted that many of the English
                            cathedrals were monastic institutions; in eight out of seventeen in the
                            twelfth century the chapters were composed entirely of monks. Collier's

                        <p>Schotel, in his Oud Hollandsch Huisgezin der Zeventiende Eeuw, p. 75,
                            says of education in Holland: "In the earliest time most of the parish
                            churches had their schools... The school of the cathedral church
                            [hoofdkerk] took the name of the great school... In these last were
                            taught not only Greek and Latin, but Dutchthat is, reading, writing, and
                            ciphering, and not alone to the children of the well-to-do, but to the
                            poor as well. They were all comrades in the school as in the street."
                            Roger's Work and Wages, 165, 166, remarks on the widely diffused
                            knowledge of Latin in the middle ages. Until the fourteenth century
                            English was not even suffered to play tender to Latin in the schools,
                            but in 1363 "it was ordeined that schoolemasters should teach their
                            scholers to construe their lessons in English &amp; not in French,
                            as before they had beene vsed." Holinshed, ii, 678. Down to the
                            Reformation Latin was taught before the reading of English, as we learn
                            from Mulcaster, an Elizabethan schoolmaster. "Now," he adds, "we are
                            returned home to our English abce." Positions, chap. v.</p>
                        <p>A definite number of scholars were to be sustained in each cathedral
                            while living in commons. Whiston's Cathedral Trusts and Harrison's

                            cites Cranmers Reformatio Legum that every cathedral should maintain a
                            school for the mature education of youth. Chantry priests, whose support
                            came from endowments for prayers for the dead, found their occupation
                            gone when the government had forbidden all praying for the dead, and had
                            indeed abolished purgatory. It was therefore ordained that such priests
                            should "exercise themselves in teaching youth to read and write and
                            bring them up in good manners and vertuous exercises." Bills were
                            brought into Parliament in Edward VI's reign "for incouraging men to
                            give lands for the maintenance of schools." Tanner's Notitia Monastica,

                        <p>By suppressing the alien priories, which were but offshoots of foreign
                            monasteries, Henry V made a tempting precedent for Henry VIII, but Henry
                            VI supplied the place of the schools lost with the suppressed priories
                            in the preceding reign by founding various free schools in 1393 and
                            1394. See the section on Schooles and Houses of Learning in Stow's

                            free schools of the Reformation period were endowed out of the spoils of
                            the monasteries. "For the most part the endowments were out of the
                            tithes formerly belonging to the religious houses or out of chantry
                            lands given to the king in the first of his reign, according to the
                            intent of parliament therein, which was to convert them from
                            superstitious uses into more godly, as in erecting great schools for the

                            Commons, in 1562 "took notice of the Want of Schools; that at least an
                            Hundred were wanting in England which before his time had been." In
                            giving this passage Strype adds, "being destroyed (I suppose he meant)

                            by the growing ambition of the people in the new social conditions. No
                            means were so convenient "to make Jack a gentleman" as to send him to
                            the university to win the coveted title of "Mr." Even cobblers sought
                            education for their sons. Hall's Satires, iv, II; Howell's Letters, 405,

                            refuses Latin to the common people because of the prevailing ambition to
                            rise in England, but he adds significantly that "both clownes in the

                        <p>There was published in 1538 an A B C book, and it has been reprinted. The
                            editor writes a preface wherein he says the Ten Commandments are not
                            included. But they are included in rhymerhyme was the only amelioration
                            of reading in that day. This is the authorized primer of 1538, though
                            the editor says it is not. It has the A B C and the "a b abs," the
                            Lord's Prayer in Latin and English, the Hail Mary in both tongues, and.
                            the Creed in both. Then there are parts of songs in Latin, "to help a

                            then a series of rhyming precepts. The great number of graces before and
                            after meat came from the habit of having children say grace. There were
                            no breakfasts in Henry VIII's time, and no graces for such a meal.</p>
                        <p>One may be permitted to doubt the unbroken continuity of the master's
                            Latin in many cases. The language in which the celebrated Harvey
                            lectured to medical students on the circulation of the blood was
                            probably better Latin than an ordinary schoolmaster's, but it is
                            intentionally mottled throughout with English. Take this phrase for one
                            example of a thousand: "Exempto corde frogg scipp eele crawle dogg
                            ambulat." Prelectiones, 7. But Bacon says that pupils are to make paper
                            books and to note the best sentences of the Roman tongue, and practice
                            them in speaking and writing.</p>
                        <p>I have referred in the margin to Wigglesworth's complaint of the
                            "boldness to transgress the college law in speaking English." Brinsley
                            laments the remissness of his time in teaching English. Some colleges in
                            the English universities made the constant use of Latin obligatory
                            (Brinsley's Ludus, 211), but in all lectures and exercises were in
                            Latin. Harvard students were quite unable to speak Latin when Dankers
                            met them in 1689. It may safely be said that the colloquial use of Latin
                            never found a lodgment in America.</p>
                        <p>Brinsley had "laboured and striven by Ferula and all meanes of severity"
                            to improve the Latin of his boys, but he says, "I have not been able to
                            make Schollers to vtter their mindes in any tollerable manner of
                            ordinary things," etc., "without great severity." He confesses" they
                            will not be brought to give overspeaking English." Ludus Literarius,
                            215. Theoretically, students admitted to Harvard could all speak Latin,
                            but the requirements for admission were probably not strictly exacted.
                            "When any scholar is able to read Tully or such like classical Latin
                            author <hi rend="i">extempore,</hi> and to make and speak true Latin in

                        <p>The rage for disputation in the schools had been even greater in earlier
                            times before logic had been mainly relegated to the universities.
                            Fitzstephen says in the twelfth century that upon holy days assemblies
                            gather in the churches to hear these disputaitons of scholars, in which
                            all the technical forms of reasoning and rhetoric taught by the
                            schoolmen are practiced for display, and boys of the different schools
                            "wrangle together in the art of versifying, and canvase the principles
                            of Grammar." Stow's Survey, 705, with his quaint translation, 710, 799,
                            edition 1633. In the sixteenth century this had been done away with, but
                            Stow himself had seen assemblies of boys from various schools gathered
                            in a churchyard to dispute on an improvised platform about the
                            principles of grammar for the fun of the thing. As above, 64. When these
                            gatherings ceased the boys from the rival schools of St. Pauls and St.
                            Anthonys would provoke one another in the open street with the challenge
                            to debate "Salve tu quoque, placet tibi mecum disputare?" To which the
                            reply "Placet" being given, they fell to wrangling over tenses and
                            constructions until often there ensued a general scrimmage of the two
                            parties laden with satchels of books and piling themselves on one
                            another in heaps to the obstruction of the streets.</p>
                        <p>The usher who was ultimately to be master of the free school at Charles
                            City, Va., was apparently incompetent to teach writing and arithmetic.
                            The Company gave him permission to take with him "an expert writer," who
                            should be able to teach" the <hi rend="i">grounds</hi> of arithmetic,
                            whereby to instruct the children in matters of account." But no other
                            provision was made for such a man than to give him his passage free,
                            leaving him to be paid by the parents. Abstract of Records, ii, 167. The
                            form proposed for the organization of the school at Charles City, Va.,
                            was identical with that carried out in the grammar school of William and
                            Mary College, nearly a hundred years later. There was in both a master,
                            an usher, and a writing master. Compare Ingle's Letter, 1705, in
                            Historical Collections relating to the Colonial Church, Virginia, 140.
                            See the statute regulating the mendicancy of scholars of the university
                            in 1388. Statutes at Large, ii, 302. Students appear to have continued
                            to beg until forbidden by the statute of 1572 in the reign of Elizabeth.

                            the "infidel" was substituted in part for the poor scholar as a means of
                            stimulating liberality. A kind of mixed school, in which plebeian
                            arithmetic jostled Latin grammar, existed in England and appeared early
                            in America. For example, Dedham Records for 1663, 1670, iv, 67, 133.

                            a schoolmaster in 1723 is specifically bound as an additional duty "that

                        <p>The old conception of education is struggling with the new. Of old higher
                            education was the property of the few. In 1559 one of the measures
                            suggested to Parliament was that the study of the laws, temporal or
                            civil, be restricted to the sons of noblemen or gentlemen. Seven years
                            later Knox sought to teach everybody their "first rudimentie" in order
                            to render them Protestant. In 1616 the Synod of Dort tried to teach the
                            catechism to all for purposes of religious indoctrination. In 1622 we
                            find Brinsley struggling blindly with the principles of education, "God
                            having ordained schooles of learning to be a principall meanes to reduce
                            a barbarous people to ciuilities." It was just twenty-five years later
                            that Massachusetts proposed to confound "the ould deluder Satan" by
                            schools especially in Latin and Greek and Hebrew, but English schools
                            were finally almost the only outcome of the act, the practical sense of
                            the people gradually doing away with the superannuated Latin school. Of
                            course, the clergy were educated in Latin. Justus Forward, of
                            Belchertown, Mass., so late as 1763, writes D. D. (dies dominica) for
                            Sunday, and several other days appear in their Latin dress. He says
                            "studiebam" and "occupatus studiendo," "occupatus de iisdem," and

                            Neill, in his Virginia Vetusta, says that the island in question was at
                            the mouth of the Susquehanna, and gives for authority the
                            Hermans-Fai-thorne map. I had the unique copy of this map in the British
                            Museum examined, and received this report: "There is no island marked
                            Palmer's Island on the map indicated at the embouchure of the
                            Susquehanna or at any other point. There are marks of islands, but no
                            name attached." That the island at the mouth of the Susquehanna was
                            called Palmer's Island is to be deduced from the Proceedings of the
                            Council in Maryland Archives, where an observation of its longitude is

                            which two cows have been bequeathed in 1691. As early as 1655 four cows
                            were left in Isle of Wight County for maintaining and schooling orphans.
                            In 1669 King Free School, in the same county, was established by
                            bequest, and some other endowments can be traced, while there were those
                            probably of which no record has been found. See two papers on this

                            that brutality which made his last years so terrible for Virginia, and
                            brought about his own ignominious downfall. In 1671, when Berkeley
                            wrote, the Symmes free school was in existence, the Eaton school was
                            founded before 1646 probably, the King Free School endowment was made
                            two years before, and four years later Peasley's liberal bequest was
                            given for another free school. Both the Symmes and Eaton schools were in
                            existence more than a century after their planting. An act had been
                            passed in 1661 for the founding of a college which involved a free
                            school. Berkeley probably knew better than any other person why the
                            project slumbered. See section xxv of the present chapter. But the
                            English system of free schools did not and could not obtain to any
                            considerable extent in Virginia in 1671 or even later; physical and
                            social conditions were against it. Compare Foote's Virginia, i, 12. In
                            colony times the only Virginia school that rose to the dignity of the
                            English free schools was the one attached to William and Mary College.
                            Compare the inhibitions of printing in Virginia in 1682, Virginia
                            Historical Register, iii, 13, and the utter prohibition of printing
                            presses in Effingham's instructions of 1685. The allusions to schools in
                            the seventeenth century that can be picked up from the remaining local
                            records of Virginia are not many, but by comparing them with Beverley's
                            statement of Effingham's course in licensing teachers about 1684, and
                            then examining the replies of the Virginia clergy in 1724 to the Queries
                            of the Bishop of London, we can form some notion of the voluntary
                            education by means of "old field schools" that early grew up among the
                            Virginians. As the bishop's query asks only about parish schools, some
                            of the replies give negative information; but wherever the clergyman
                            mentions the rustic schools they seem to be fairly numerous for a new
                            country, to be taught by men and not women, and not to be above the
                            level of the rough country school of the period elsewhere. "In most
                            parishes," says Hugh Jones, "are schools in Little Houses built on
                            purpose, where are taught English and writing." One private school for
                            Latin and Greek flourishes in the same parish with two endowed schools
                            of a lower grade. In one case a plantation was given to the incumbent of
                            the parish on condition that he should sustain "a sufficient person" to
                            teach reading, writing, and arithmetic. In Maryland, the ideal of Bray
                            was a free school in every county, and one or two in the province for
                            Indians. This does not account for the little schools. General View of

                            after a fashion put it together. This probably represents the education
                            thought fit for his son by the Virginia planter a hundred years later.
                            Even so much Latin probably could not always be had.</p>
                        <p>There were some convicts who were capable of teaching, but the convicts
                            were not usually of the kind to supply teachers, and in Virginia in the
                            seventeenth century there were fewer of these than of indentured
                            servants known as" free-willers" who had embarked of their own accord,
                            and the" kids" who had been" trapanned" aboard ship by craft or force.
                            The schoolmasters no doubt usually belonged to the class of voluntary or
                            involuntary redemptioners, and not among the petty criminals who were
                            sold for seven years. The will of Colonel John Carter, in 1669,
                            specifically provides for the purchase of a bond servant who had been"
                            brought up in the Latin school," to teach his son Robert, afterward the
                            famous King Carter of Virginia. See quotations from the records at
                            Lancaster Court House in a letter from Mr. Wilson Miles Cary in The
                            Nation of April 22, 1897. Boucher long afterward says that two thirds of
                            the schools in Maryland were taught either by indentured servants or by
                            convicts. Causes, 184, 189. I think the convicts much the smaller of the
                            two classes. Boucher would have mentioned the fact had it been the other

                            gradually changed to our more local system. Compare, for example, what
                            Brinsley says in 1622 in speaking of badly managed schools: "That it
                            were better to turne the maintenance given to the schoole to bear the

                            together. Such an order was doubtless without any result. In 1645, after
                            the news of the great Virginia massacre had startled New England, boys
                            were ordered to learn the use of small guns, half pikes, and bows and
                            arrows, thus reviving old English customs and customs as old as the
                            Roman law, no longer of any value. Compare Ridley's View of the Law,
                            1634, p, 48.</p>
                        <p>In President Chauncy's Commencement Sermon of 1655, p. 38, what may be

                            Hebrew also, which ought to be had in great account with us for the Old
                            Testament sake."</p>
                        <p>In the platform of Church Discipline adopted in 1648, vi, 6, the school
                            is regarded as "lawful, profitable, &amp; necessary for training of
                            such in good Literature or Learning as may afterward be called forth
                            unto office of Pastor or Teacher in the Church." This hesitating
                            indorsement of the school is backed up by half a dozen texts of
                            Scripture. In re-enacting the school law the Connecticut General Court
                            of 1673 omitted the epithet "old dcluder" before Satan, whose character
                            was well enough known by this time, and in 1692 the diabolical preamble
                            disappeared entirely from the laws of Massachusetts. Compare also the
                            New Hampshire law of 1715. In 1673 Connecticut made it obligatory on
                            county towns to have a grammar school, "for the use of the county,"
                            under penalty (after 1677) of ten pounds. In 1678 Connecticut took the
                            lead of Massachusetts by making it obligatory on every town of thirty
                            families to have an English school. In 1684 the surplus money of the
                            treasury was to go to the grammar schools. All this legislation
                            testifies to the increasing difficulty of maintaining the so-called
                            Latin school. Massachusetts in 1671 increased the fine for neglecting
                            schools to ten pounds, and ordered it paid to the nearest town having a
                            grammar school. To cite no other evidence of the struggle to keep alive
                            grammar schools, the New Hampshire law of 1721, in something like
                            desperation, makes the failure for a single month on the part of a town
                            of one hundred families to provide a Latin school punishable by a fine
                            of twenty pounds, to be collected from the personal estate of the
                            selectmen. This was no doubt in depreciated currency. See Weeden's
                            Economic History of New England on the decline, and in some cases the

                        <p>From the Third Report for the Commissioners on Education in Scotland for
                            1867-'68 we learn that schools for Latin, to which were subsequently
                            added "Lecture" schools for English, existed in the chief towns from a
                            very early period. Several of these schools are known to date from the
                            twelfth century. All the chief towns had schools before the beginning of
                            the sixteenth century. "The statute of James IV (1496), which ordains
                            that barons and freeholders who were of substance should put their
                            eldest sons and heirs to the 'scholes fra they be six or nine year of
                            age, and to remain at the Grammar Schools quill they be competentlie
                            founded and have perfite Latine,' is conclusive on this point." These
                            schools were closely connected with the cathedrals, monasteries, and
                            religious establishments; the teachers were ecclesiastics "or in some
                            way connected with the cathedrals and monasteries," and they were
                            sometimes sustained by altarages. "The scholars... were no doubt
                            originally those destined for the church. Gradually, however, sons of
                            gentry and of barons... were sent... to these schools, and from the

                            the higher middle classes took advantage of them." It is interesting to
                            find that not only the grammar but the elementary schools existed in
                            Scotland in 1494. In that year the chancellor of the diocese of Glasgow
                            orders that no one without his license should teach "scholares in
                            grammatica aut juvenes in puerilibus." Light is thrown on the condition
                            of Scottish schools just before the Reformation by Andrew Melville's
                            account in McCrie's Life of Knox, 475, 476. The repeated legislation in
                            1616, 1633, 1646, and finally in 1696, shows how slowly the plan was put
                            in force. Report of Commissioners, p. 8. It is worth remarking as
                            illustrating the force of historic continuity, even in time of
                            revolution, that Knox's reader or minister teaching the rudiments in an
                            "upaland" town is only a Protestant reproduction of the older priest in
                            small parishes combining teaching with "praying for the people," such as
                            we have already mentioned above as existing in former ages in England.
                            It would carry us too far afield to note here the rather futile efforts
                            made in the seventeenth century to make Knox's ideal actual in Scotland,
                            or to discuss the Scotch school establishment of 1696, etc. It is
                            sufficient that the plan set forth in 1560 remained a fixed ideal and
                            tradition in Scotland, as the plan of 1647 did in New England. In 1704
                            most of the parishes in Scotland had each a Latin school in name, but
                            the masters were nearly all incompetent. The schools were not free, but,

                            Holland, the reformed clergy early sought to strengthen their position
                            by means of schools and a system of catechetical instruction. The plan
                            proposed by the Synod of Dort in 1618, probably with a purpose of
                            extirpating Arminianism as well as Romanism, was to establish schools
                            for teaching "Christian doctrine" "in towns and country places where
                            none have existed." In these schools the children of the poor were to be
                            gratuitously instructed by orthodox teachers, well versed in the
                            catechism. Two whole days in the week were to be given up to teaching
                            the catechism. The resolutions are translated in De Witt's Historical
                            Sketch of the Parochial School System of Holland preceding Dunshee's
                            History of the Dutch Church School in New York. Of the state of the
                            schools of Holland in the seventeenth century a notion may be formed
                            from Schotel's Oud Hollandsch Huisgezin, Hoofdstuk, x, from which I have
                            quoted in a preceding note. Compare also a brief summary in English of
                            Schotel's chapter in Geddes's History of the Administration of John De
                            Witt, 33-37. Some of the mistresses of Dutch bye schools or shop schools
                            (by-scholen, winkelscholen) could not read, but taught the catechism
                            orally, and the school teaching was generally of a primitive sort. But
                            the Synod of Dort had made a declaration resembling that of Knox in
                            favor of schools in every parish, and this unattained Dutch ideal would
                            be likely to have weight also in New England. Rude and imperfect as was
                            the system launched by the Massachusetts law of 1647, it made "writeing
                            and reading," not the catechism, as in Holland, the corner stone of the
                            country school.</p>
                        <p>A letter written by Governor Dudley to the Society for the Propagation of
                            the Gospel in 1701 says of Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire,
                            and Maine, "I am of opinion that there are no children to be found ten
                            years old who do not read well, nor men of twenty that do not write
                            tolerably." Such a condition probably has never existed among the people
                            of so large a region in any part of America from the Glacial epoch to
                            the present time, and, considering the character of the astute
                            politician who expressed this opinion, one should not take it too
                            seriously. It is said by Upham, the industrious historian of Salem, that

                        <p>In the Blue Book for 1867 the Report on Burgh and Middle Class Schools in
                            Scotland, from which I have already quoted, referring to the Buke of
                            Discipline, says that by the colleges which Knox proposed for every
                            notable town he intended "grammar schools on the model of those more
                            ancient seminaries in which the 'trivium' or course of three sciences
                            were taught," p. 5. A passage in the same report on p. 7 suggests the
                            source of John Harvard's inspiration: "Cambuslang, where the Rev. John
                            Harrison, minister of the parish, endowed a Grammar School in 1602; with
                            Prestonpans, where a trilingual school for the teaching of Latin, Greek,
                            and Hebrew was founded about the same time by the Rev. John Davidson,
                            who endowed it with all his fortune, including his books." That it was
                            early found difficult to exact Hebrew of the Harvard students is
                            apparent from the extracts from Wigglesworth's diary in 1653, given in
                            Sibley's Harvard Graduates, vol. i, under the name of the diarist.</p>
                        <p>A multitude of illustrations might be cited. "That ye education of youth

                            Records in 1660, vol. ii, 373. A very notable entry in the town records
                            of New Haven in 1723 directs that a certain piece of land be used "for
                            the educating of children of Congregational or Presbyterian parents
                            only, and for no other use whatever, forever, hereafter." Atwater's New

                        <p>Meals were hard to reckon with in the reigns of Elizabeth and James. It
                            seems clear that most people of position in Elizabeth's reign ate their
                            first meal at about noon. Harrison, in Holinshed, i, 287, says:
                            "Heretofore there hath bene much more time spent in eating and drinking
                            than commonlie is in these daies, for whereas of old we had breakfasts
                            in the forenoone, beverages or nuntions after dinner, and thereto reare
                            suppers generallie when it was time to go to rest.... Now these od

                            The school was then resumed from ten to twelve, and again from two to
                            six. But most English schools were held unbrokenly from six to eleven
                            and from one to six, and even at a later period, as we may infer from
                            Brinsley. In another Scottish school, that at Elgin in 1649, work began
                            at six and continued till six, with two hours' intermissionone for
                            breakfast and one for dinner. Report as above, p. 15. I can find no
                            trace in later schools of the bever taken in the schoolroom, which must
                            have been the custom in the reign of Henry VIII. The statutes of St.
                            Paul's School, as drawn by Colet, say: "Also I will they bring no meate
                            nor drinke, nor bottel, nor use in the school no breakfasts, nor
                            drinkings in the tyme of learnynge in no wise," etc. Knight's Life of
                            Colet, 308. The hours of St. Paul's School were from seven to eleven and
                            from one to five. This, with the difference between Aberdeen in 1553 and
                            Elgin in 1649, as given above, and some other facts I have noted, cause
                            me to suspect that the longest hours came in only with the new zeal of
                            the Reformation period. But Colet's statutes are very severe in refusal
                            of holidays, etc. "Yf the master grantith any remedyes he shall forfeit
                            xl s. totiens quotiens," etc. The holy days of the Church were
                            interruption enough in Colet's time. As late as 1763 I find in Justin
                            Forward's diary that he visited Hatfield's school, and advised a
                            "vacancy," which was granted. Manuscript in my possession.</p>
                        <p>John Brinsley was a clergyman of Puritan tendencies, and a brother-in-law
                            to the famous Bishop Hall. He has been less cited than his forerunners
                            Ascham or Mulcaster, but he appears to have had practical ideas on the
                            subject of school management in advance of both, and his books are most
                            instructive to the student of the history of education, especially his
                            Ludus Literarius and his Consolations for Our Grammar Schooles. The
                            latter has a special interest for us, because it was written to promote
                            the welfare of the schools projected for Virginia, as well as those in
                            Ireland and Wales. It was submitted to the Virginia Company for approval
                            before its publication. Among the reforms advocated by Brinsley were a
                            somewhat later hour of beginning schools, a recess for breakfast in the
                            middle of the forenoon, and another in the middle of the afternoon, and
                            a large attention to the teaching of English.</p>

                            schoolmasters when they teach little and beat much," says Becon. He says
                            one might think them "vexed with some infernal fury." It should be
                            remembered, in mitigation of censure on the schoolmasters, that in a
                            civilization like that of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,
                            discipline without corporal punishment would have been more difficult
                            than in our later time. The pupils regarded their master as a natural
                            enemy. This was hit off by a Dutch schoolmaster of that time, whose sign
                            before his door showed a portrait of himself sitting in the midst of his
                            uproarious and unruly scholars with a crown on his head and this legend
                            be low: "Het gekroonde hoofd-sweer" (The crowned headache). Schotel's
                            Oud Hollandsch Huisgezin, 76. From this antagonism came the practice of
                            "barring out," or, as it was called in this country, "turning the master
                            out." There was an early instance of this turning out at William and
                            Mary, in which the boys received encouragement from Governor Nicholson
                            himself, and fired blank cartridges at Dr. Blair, the president. This
                            custom seems to have died in England only in the nineteenth century. It
                            lingered long enough in this country for the present writer to have

                            from it, and to have had the bitter experience when about twelve years
                            old of leading in an actual conflict of the kind, when the resolute
                            master with stalwart help from without broke down the door casing and
                            carried the house by storm. Addison at the same age was more successful
                            at Litchfield in an enterprise of the kind, according to Dr. Johnson.
                            The practice was very common in the seventeenth century. See the
                            Gentleman's Magazine of 1828, part ii, pp. 402-408. The custom of
                            "taking the school" was set down as an old one in Aberdeen in 1568, when
                            the boys secured three clays of vacation. In 1604 the boys again "took
                            the school" with guns and other weapons, and foraged for "puir folke's
                            geir," such as "geisse, foullis, and ultheris vivaris." Burgh Records of

                        <p>Mulcaster, like his predecessor Ascham, was an admirer of the classical
                            attainments of Queen Elizabeth, and so inclined to advise a higher
                            education for women than was customary. But tradition was against him.
                            "I set not yong maidens to publike grammar Schooles," he says, "a thing
                            not used in my countrie, I send them not to the vniversities, having no
                            president thereof in my countrie." He says that maidens "taught to read

                            Positions, 166. The Puritans naturally regarded Elizabeth's rule with
                            disfavor, and her masculine acquirements seemed to them rather
                            unscriptural. Anne Bradstreet was an example, however, of an educated
                            woman in New England, though a reluctant Puritan, and An Cotton of a
                            cultivated woman in Virginia. "For the first fifty years after the
                            settlement very little is on record in respect to schools, and from the
                            numerous instances of persons of the second generation who could not
                            write their names, it is evident that education was at a low ebb. Female
                            instruction in particular must have been greatly neglected, when the
                            daughters of men who occupied important offices in the town and church
                            were obliged to make a mark for their signature. Yet the business of
                            teaching was then chiefly performed by women.... Every quarter of the
                            town had its mistress, who taught children to behave, to ply the needle
                            through all the mysteries of hemming, overhand stitching, and darning up
                            to the sampler, and to read from A B C through the spelling book to the
                            psalter. Children were taught to be mannered and pay respect to their
                            elders, especially to dignitaries. In the street they stood aside when
                            they met any respectable person or stranger, and saluted him with a bow
                            or courtesy, stopping modestly until he had passed. This was called
                            'making their manners.'" Miss Caulkin's History of New London, 395.
                            "Children who did not attend school were taught to read at home, and
                            nearly all could read, females as well as males. Writing was considered
                            much less important, and it was not judged necessary that females in
                            common life should learn to write." Judd's History of Hadley, 64.
                            Compare Bailey's Andover, 13, footnote. Judd adds that girls were not
                            permitted to attend public schools in Boston until 1790, and that the
                            permission was not granted in Northampton until 1802. Mrs. Grant says
                            that in Albany women could usually read in Dutch the Bible and a few
                            Calvinistic tracts, but not English in 1704. Memoirs of an American

                            the age that D'Ewes finds consolation in reflecting that the religious
                            opinions of his licentious, riotous, and impious fellow-scholars were
                            uncorrupted by "Anabaptisticall or Pelagian heresies," and that there

                            Instructions, in the Library of Congress. It is printed with Hartwell,
                            Blair, and Chilton's account of Virginia, and the copy of the latter in
                            the Library of Congress is annotated by some critic, who notes slight
                            variations in the sense of the English version of the charter from the
                            Latin original. The phrase "studium generale "has a sense hardly
                            appreciated by those who copied it from the ancient charter for William
                            and Mary. See Heinrich Denifle, Die Universitten des Mittelalters bis
                            1400, 1-29, for an exhaustive study of this word. On page 15 he says:

                            intricate the world has ever seen. The feudal law in its passing had
                            left behind a mass of technicalities, and the evasions of that law had
                            given birth to a multitude of fictions. In many cases instruments of
                            conveyance were ostensibly instruments to do something else, and they
                            were often not registered, but kept secret. There was a jargon of
                            land-law terms mastered by conveyancers, that made it sometimes
                            difficult to transfer land. In the century preceding colonization there
                            came in the custom of piling up whole vocabularies of conveyance in one
                            deed, with endless tediousness of repetition of clauses and provisos.
                            The statutes were stuffed at the same time until the reader "was made
                            giddy by a continual recurrence of the same form of words in the same
                            endless period." Law came into disrepute as something hardly
                            comprehensible, and a source of endless entanglements to the lay mind.
                            Lawyers were forbidden in the colonial courts. In Virginia mercenary

                        <p>The New England colonies had a like prejudice, and would not suffer a
                            single lawyer to becloud the acts of the early courts. When
                            Massachusetts came to framing a working Constitution in 1641 there was a
                            rivalry between Ward and Winthrop, educated as lawyers, and Cotton, who
                            wished to proceed on a theological basis. The lawyers triumphed, but
                            they did so by holding to the severe simplicity of old English law. The
                            laws were not even called laws, but liberties; a man had the liberty of
                            being hanged in certain cases. Somebody saw the absurdity, and appended
                            a note explaining that liberty meant law, and the experiment of using
                            this term for laws was not again tried in Massachusetts. The Dutch had
                            but one lawyer among them, and they pretended to be unwilling to give
                            either side in a case the exclusive benefit of his skill. They refused
                            him permission to practice. Thus it came to pass that the earliest laws
                            were simple and direct. Decisions were based on common sense and the
                            merits of the case, as seen by the magistrate. There were other forces
                            that held land laws to simplicity. There was little land in America that
                            had come through feudal tenure. Even the king as a source of title did
                            not usually appear in the deed. In the later seventeenth century lawyers
                            and conveyancers began to be sought after; their services could no
                            longer be dispensed with. The colonial laws and deeds after the
                            Restoration became somewhat more intricate, and affected the English in
                            their style. But the habit of passing <note id="note_823"

                            remained substantially the same, the 'simple and direct ownership of the

                        <p>There was one trait of land law that had survived from the middle
                            agesthat had survived apparently from nobody knows what remote
                            antiquity. It made so dry a matter as the transfer of land picturesque
                            and dramatic. This was called livery of seizinthe delivery of
                            possession. The seller stood on the tract to be conveyed and taking a
                            bit of turf from the land, and, if there were trees, plucking a twig and
                            thrusting it into the turf, passed it into the hands of the buyer. The
                            custom was capable of many variations. Judge Sewall, of Boston, received
                            seizin of six hundred acres of forest by "turf, twig, and splinter," as
                            if to embrace all the possibilities of timber land. In the history of
                            Salem it is recorded that John Rush took a twig from a growing tree and
                            a bit of green turf and said, "Here, son Thomas, I do before these two
                            men give you possession of this land by turffe and twigg." In turning
                            over the primitive records in Virginia one finds that "livery and sesen
                            was made of a turffe of the earth of the within written land." In other
                            cases "twigg and turff" marks another form. Sometimes the livery is
                            marked by a different form and personal estate is <note id="note_824"

                            wishing to give his whole estate for the benefit of his wife and
                            creditors, delivers to them "one silver spoone, part of premises as a
                            voucher to lead to intent, purport," etc. When a house was to be
                            delivered the seller took hold of the ring of the house door and
                            formally gave it into the hands of the new owner. The ground with its
                            appurtenances was thus handed over in a manner suitable to illiterate
                            times and restricted territories. But land in a new country became an
                            article of frequent merchandise. Tracts of wilderness, remote and
                            sometimes unsurveyed, could not be given by livery of seizin. In
                            Maryland the mere certificatethe warrant entitling the holder to take up
                            landcame presently to be passed about as current money. And, indeed, the
                            custom of livery of seizin probably went out of use in America more
                            rapidly than in England. In Virginia, the most conservative of the
                            colonies, it was still somewhat in vogue in 1748, when it is recognized
                            in a statute. Perhaps this was a mark of oncoming decrepitude. For a
                            thousand years and more it had existed without legislation; when it
                            became necessary to mention it in statute law the usage had passed its
                            prime. In England to-day the seller often passes a ferule into the hands
                            of the buyer of land without leaving the court room. So does the faint
                            shadow of ancient custom stretch itself across modern life, growing more
                            attenuated until at length it vanishes, no one perceiving where it left
                            its last trace.</p>

                        <p>One mode of holding land, the oldest known to the English world, dating
                            far back of the feudal system, seems very curious to modern eyes. It did
                            not much attract the attention of lawyers in its time. Questions
                            regarding it were settled almost wholly in the petty court of manor or
                            township, and the great jurists had no call to discuss it. As a general
                            rule it was a subordinate kind of land-holding. The town community was
                            tenant, as a whole, to the owner of the manor. The manor ownership might
                            be litigated, might be taken away by violence, but the town held of the
                            lord of the manor, whoever he might be, from time to which the memory of
                            man runs not. If the ownership of the land came into question, it was as
                            a whole. In this way it escaped almost entirely the notice of the land
                            courts and of the older writers on the law of land. But as it went out
                            of existence the township community began to attract the attention of
                            the learned. Who should have the commons? What rights had the lord of
                            the manor and the people under new conditions? And then inquiries were
                            made by the curious into the origin of the commune, and presently a
                            great literature has grown up about it mostly in a lifetime. Efforts
                            have been made to connect it with similar forms in other countries. The
                            great fact coming out in all this discussion is that the town commune
                            was very primitive. It can be traced in <note id="note_831"

                            portion of the surface of England was cultivated in this way in the
                            seventeenth century, and it shows how far human development can be

                        <p>What was this village commune? Setting aside the disputed points in its
                            ancient historywhether the commune was a combination at first of serfs,
                            or whether it was a free markit seems probable that it once held all its
                            territory in common, and that at the earliest period the arable land was
                            allotted annually. The advancement of civilization relaxed the severity
                            of this communism. Little patches were dealt out permanently to
                            residents, or at least to shareholders, but the division of land
                            retained marks of the older order. The land of a single owner was
                            scattered over the lands of the town apparently as last divided. The
                            meadow, the pasture, the mast land, and the woodland remained an
                            undivided common when William Marshall began the study of it in the
                            latter part of the eighteenth century. The fences and gates were kept up
                            by the proportionate care of the several cultivators, and the rents of
                            the lord were paid by the "town" as a whole. In New England, where there
                            was no lord, a town registry was established, and the town held the
                            disposal of land in <note id="note_832" place="unspecified"

                            "furrowlongs"were held by each household, were fenced in a common field,
                            and often for the first years of settlement were held undivided and
                            allotted year by year. Each person had his "homelot right" and "acre
                            right" in the undivided meadow, forest, and upland. These were at first
                            sold as a unit, and were termed "an accommodation." The times of
                            planting and of turning in of cattle were sometimes regulated in "field
                            meetings" or "side meetings," after the immemorial usage of the English
                            township. The common fields were in primitive towns but three. Two were
                            in different sorts of grain, the third was taking its year of rest as a
                            sheep and cow pasture. Each cultivator had to raise the crop decided on
                            by the majority in the side meeting or field meeting. It was an animated
                            scene in a common field when all the commune was planting or harvesting.
                            There were New England towns that went back to the original norm of the
                            town, and cultivated the land by dividing it annually until the town
                            should fill up. Then when the town was fuller, they divided their arable
                            land, giving each an equal chance. Society was prone to fall apart in a
                            new country. The town community held it together in common
                        helpfulness.</p>

                            sheep-raising landlords, but the greater part were yet in full vigor
                            under one and another shelter. Some seem to have kept a stiff proportion
                            of their ancient rights. We find ducking stool and pillory in one rustic
                            town; in Queen Mary's days there remained a prison and gallows in
                            another. Persons seeking justice outside the borough for any matter

                            right to appeal to higher courts was hampered and jealously watched. In
                            England the townships in James I's time looked to overlords for
                            protection. Some were resolutely independent.</p>

                        <p>That the New-Englanders were largely born to the commune is evident. They
                            were mostly farmers, and farmers in that time were frequently found in
                            village communes. Perhaps the small farmer was more susceptible to
                            Puritanism; perhaps the condition of the towns was favorable to the
                            spread of Puritanism. Threatened with inclosure of their "wastes"their
                            mast land, their woodland, and their meadowthese villagers embraced the
                            religion of the discontented. In New England the origin of the commune
                            was soon forgotten. In the time of the Revolution we find John Adams

                            mode of settlement. He had no notion of its English origin. From the
                            first, Plymouth was organized somewhat on the communal model. Salem,
                            after trying independent holdings awhile, adopted the same plan. The
                            great migration of Winthrop seems to have brought along with it the plan
                            of the village community as the very best one on which to settle Puritan
                            churches and congregations. If it was predetermined, it was a
                            masterstroke of policy; but whether it was a matter of forethought or
                            not, the townsmen must many of them have been acquainted with it. Nearly
                            the whole of New England adopted the same plan. From I know not how far
                            east clear down the coast to Connecticut and Long Island, and down the
                            Jersey coast to Delaware, the people organized in this way. One never
                            hears any other plan proposed. The phraseology of the town community was
                            theirs. The swineherd or hogreeve went through the town blowing an early
                            morning horn, the cowherd, the goatherd, the gooseherd, the shepherd
                            were all present, as needed in various New England towns. There were
                            water bailiffs, there were drummers to call people to meeting and to
                            make announcements, there were overseers of chimneys and of chimney
                            sweepers, perambulators, cullers of staves and corders of wood,
                            firewards and haywards or hedgewards, and all the half a hundred other
                            occasional officers of the town. Their names passed easily from one to
                                <pb id="VAA2405-293" n="282"/> another, like coins worn smooth. One
                            thing they missedit was the lord and his rents. But when a Connecticut
                            town moved to Newark they easily spoke of the quitrents as the lord's
                            half-penny. It would have been the lord's penny in England.</p>

                            in the cultivated field, his right to feed his cows in the common
                            pasture and in common fields when crops were off, and so on, duly
                            awarded him. A part of the fence or a gate, a pair of bars or "a lift"
                            was assigned to him to keep up. The town owned the realty and divided it
                            according to its by-laws and its own good pleasure. There were town cows
                            sometimes, there was always a town hull, and a town horse was kept at
                            Salem. Town sheep were not uncommon; a herd of two thousand paid all the
                            corporate expenses of a certain town in Connecticut. The town sometimes
                            kept packs of dogs to hunt wolves with. The tradespeople who wished to
                            settle within the bounds of the town made bargains with the "selectmen"
                            or others having charge of "the prudentials of the town" for a monopoly.

                            was always a member of a community and therefore civilized. Thus grew

                        <p>The word town underwent a change in New England, or at least a provincial
                            sense became the main sense of the word. It did not mean at first a
                            town, but a group of farmers engaged in agriculture on a particular
                            plan. The New England village was almost precisely the same at the
                            outset as the English farming community. But it was in a new country
                            where there is a chance to change, where change is inevitable. In the
                            first place, the township in Massachusetts took on governmental
                            functions. It became the political unit; this was its capital change.
                            Deputies were elected to the Legislature from the "towns," large and
                            small. The counties sank into insignificane, the towns were the sources
                            of power. In the next place, the town boundary was also the boundary of
                            the parish. The parish in Massachusetts was of primary importance. And,
                            in the third place, the rulers, finding themselves freed from some of
                            the cares of <note id="note_845" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">

                            made even the farms attachments to the several towns. The town meeting,
                            from being a side meeting to assign a date for the putting in and out of
                            cows, became a place where the very sources of political power lay. The
                            leading magistrates were outvoted by the representatives of the towns
                            over and over. This was unexpected in a day when the magistrate was
                            reverenced as the appointed of the Lord. The magistrates offered strong
                            resistance, but the stronger resistance of the commons would not down.
                            Efforts were made to overrule the lower House, but the deputies, having
                            got the bit in their teeth, carried things their own way, and then the
                            government fell into the hands of the towns, or rather, as has been
                            said, into the hands of the churches, whose members did all the
                        voting.</p>

                        <p>The custom of granting farms in the first generation to prominent
                            citizens in return for the assistance given in colony planting was
                            discontinued. In the rivalry between independent towns and farms the
                            towns by natural selection won the day. The prominent than, a little
                            more eminent than the others, was content to take a larger share in the
                            town instead of a separate grant. After the first generation there were
                            fewer men of distinction engaged in planting towns, and hence fewer
                            occasions for special <note id="note_847" place="unspecified"

                            exceedingly fond of the town system; he did not think of doing without
                            it. Everywhere that New-Englanders went in the first and later
                            generations the town system went with them. But it did not elsewhere
                            acquire any such prominence as in Massachusetts and Connecticut. There
                            were no political privileges, and the church was not of the prevailing
                            order. Long Island, New Jersey, and certain regions in the Delaware Bay
                            all had the inevitable town plan. One or two churches moved away into
                            South Carolina and Georgia, where their village plan was lost in the
                            larger agriculture of the South. If we had the evidence that is perhaps
                            lost, we should find that the township or village community could be
                            found germinating in the Southern colonies. Such a sub-colony as that of
                            Barkly or Berkley, to which an "incorporation by some vsuall or fit
                            name" was promised, must have contemplated common lands and other
                            elements of the commune. That and its rustic ally the hundred, and its
                            civic type the borough, were the form in which nearly all the local
                            government of England was cast. But nearly all the men of Barkly
                            perished at the hands of the Indians or otherwise. Indian massacres, the
                            growth of a staple demanding much land, and the consequent rapid
                            development of territorial greed, soon destroyed every vestige of the
                            town in Virginia. A "hundred" in 1660 proved that a "commons" had been
                            granted to it in 1631. If we look to Maryland it is hard <note

                            leet" established there very early had jurisdiction of commons, as is
                            probable from the usual organization of a manor. But the circumstances
                            were most unfavorable to the community; the great staple of tobacco set
                            people's teeth on edge to become rich out of it. Cultivation almost from
                            the start began to change its character. Great and greater shiploads of
                            bond servants, free-willers, kids, and convicts were unloaded in
                            Virginia and Maryland and sold for four years' service. For half a
                            century or more large estates with white bond servants were the rule. In
                            1670 there were three times as many white bond servants as blacks in
                            Virginia. Within ten or fifteen years after that, as the century drew to
                            a close, Virginia ceased to buy white servants in any numbers, and
                            plantations worked by black servants became the rule.</p>

                        <p>A very usual method of holding land in England was by the manorial
                            system. The manors were entailed to the eldest son or other heir of the
                            manor lord. But parts of these manors were village communities from the
                            most ancient times. In New England they made village communities without
                            any lord of the manor, and quitrents were left out of the count. The
                            granting of farms quite independent of the town contemplated another
                            English mode of landholding. But just as agricultural <note

                            were independent farms driven to the wall in the Northeast. An order
                            went forth that farms should belong to the towns in which they were
                            situated. It was inconvenient to have them separate. The Church was the
                            drilling ground to keep the people strictly in line with advanced
                            Protestantism. The farmer could have no rights in common fields, his
                            cattle were foreign to the pasture, his pigs had no right to pick up
                            nuts from the common woodland, he had no acre rights when dividends were
                            made, but he must attend the town church and pay the dues levied upon
                            him for the clergy and other town burdens, and all burdens were put
                            directly on the town. Individuals were unknown, the town was the
                            taxpayer and the landowner. Sometimes, as at Salem, the town bought out
                            a man's holdings, his "accommodation," exchanging therefor a farmstead
                            carved out of the great unappropriated wilderness. But the favorite
                            method of settling land came to be in a colony or town. By this means
                            the ecclesiastical power was greatly augmented. The minister was usually
                            the one educated man in the parish. He knew some Latin and Greek, and he
                            had even a smattering of Hebrew. He was educated in what was the only
                            branch of knowledge affected by minister or laymantheology. His
                            dominance over the unlettered was tolerably complete. On the other hand,
                            the Southern planter, with long stretches of woodland between him and
                            his neighbors, could <pb id="VAA2405-299" n="288"/> cultivate his wide
                            fields in almost entire independence; his code of morals even was mostly
                            his own, but his public interests were as extensive as his county or his
                            province. This state of society begot self-reliance, and produced more
                            leading statesmen than the other; but the people lacked the New England
                            cohesion and susceptibility to organization, without which the
                            statesmanship of the Revolution would have been vain. The Southerner,
                            from his isolation and from other causes, became hospitable, eager for
                            society, and in general spontaneously friendly and generous; the New
                            England people became close-fisted and shrewd in trade; it is a trait of
                            village life. But the benevolence of New England was more effective than
                            that of the South, because it was organized and systematic. The village
                            life of the extreme North trained the people to trade, and led to
                            commercial development, and it made popular education possible. The sons
                            of the great planters at the South were averse to commerce; they were
                            also the most liberally educated and polished in manners of all the
                            colonists; but the scattered common people could have few schools, and
                            were generally rude and ignorant, even when compared with the lower
                            class of New-Englanders, who stood a chance of getting some rough
                            schooling, besides a certain education from the meeting-house and the

                        <p>A stranger might in old New England find a constable at the door some
                            morning to warn him to leave. He was not expected to go, but his
                            landlord must give security that he would not be chargeable, or at least
                            the town was quit of him. People attracted by the superior medical skill
                            of Boston physicians were thus warned. St. Clement's Manor, in Maryland,
                            at its Court Leet, orders John Mansell "to remove his inmate or give
                            security." The towns had done so from the most remote times. Even in the
                            Salic law, a thousand years before, no person was suffered to remove
                            from one villa to another. A trace of this is found in the Connecticut
                            law that "noe Inhabitant shall have power to make sale of his
                            accorodation of house and lands vntil he have first propounded the sale
                            thereof to the Towne... and they refuse to accept of the sale tendered."
                            The town community is dead in New England, though its methods of
                            government remain, and even in the West and South there are traces of it
                            in the language. In the old common field, strips were allotted from year
                            to year, but one piece of land belonged to nobody. It was called "Jack's
                            Land." Here the plowman left his plow, his hoe, his seed to the
                            hospitality of an undefined somebody called Jack. The author of
                            "Wonderworking Providence," a New England captain, calls Ireland "Jack's
                            Land." It was nobody's country; one man and one party after another

                        <p>In Virginia and the South the parish vestry took the place of the
                            township in New England. Virginia was the Southern model as
                            Massachusetts was the Northern. In the extant parish records of Virginia
                            the vestry makes a contract for building a church, ordains a referendum
                            for locating a church, and employs and dismisses a minister, builds a
                            paling fence about the church, and "distreynes" for tithes. The vestry
                            also opens roads, appoints over-seers of roads and holds them to
                            account, levies fines for bastardy and concubinage and for disorder in
                            church, orders the land processioned, relieves the poor, binds out
                            "orphants," appoints side men or collectors, and objects to the
                            admission of non-residents lest they be chargeable. The parish also in
                            one case elects a "select vestrye" from each of three precincts. In 1694
                            Petsoe Parish divides itself into eight precincts for the processioning
                            of land. Here is nearly everything that was done by the New England town
                            transacted by the vestry of a Virginia parish. The parish in Virginia

                        <p>The processioning of land was observed by the Virginians between Easter
                            and Whitsunday. They made formal processions about the bounds of their
                            several tracts, renewing the marks in the line trees. When a division
                            line had been thus marked three times it was no longer open to question.
                            In Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Long Island the townships, as
                            landholders, were "to go the rounds "at regular intervals. Each
                            individual owner of plowland and mowland within the town must trace his
                            boundary every winter if his adjacent neighbor exacted it. The colonists
                            were thus following a custom whose origin was lost in the obscurity
                            before written records.</p>

                        <p>The leadership of the great families was sustained in New York and in the
                            colonies south of Pennsylvania by primogeniturethe prerogative of the
                            eldest son to inherit the landed estate in case the father left no will.
                            Custom followed the law, and fathers who willed their property usually
                            left most or all of the land to the eldest son, as belonging to him by
                            prescriptive right. To primogeniture the aristocratic colonies added the
                            dead hand of entail, by which the land was sent down for generations in
                            the line of the eldest male. Even a clumsy fiction, called in law

                        <p>The Pilgrims at Plymouth and the Massachusetts Puritans had belonged to
                            that politico-religious party in England which sought the abolition of
                            certain old abuses. As early as 1636 Plymouth enacted that land should
                            be held after "the laudable custom, tenure, and hold of the manor of
                            East Greenwich "that is, in an ancient Saxon way preserved at the coming
                            of William the Conqueror by the county of Kent. One characteristic of
                            this tenure was that it divided the lands equally among the sons in case
                            there was no will. Massachusetts, which expressly abolished many of the
                            worst features of feudal tenure, by name, gave to the eldest son a
                            double portion according to the Mosaic code, but divided the rest among
                            daughters as well as sons. This system prevailed throughout New England.
                            Primogeniture had come to be esteemed a natural right, and the
                            Massachusetts leaders felt obliged more than once to defend themselves
                            from the charge of having "denied the right of the eldest son." They
                            answered by showing the comparative insignificance of land in a new
                            country, and took refuge behind the example of Moses. Pennsylvania took
                            the same middle course of sheltering innovation under the law of Moses
                            by giving the eldest son a double portion. The laws of some of the
                            colonies made the <note id="note_868" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">

                            with personal estate for the debts of the deceased, which robbed the
                            eldest of a part of his "insolent prerogative"; but it was not until the
                            shock of the Revolution that primogeniture and entail were swept away,
                            under the leadership of Jefferson and others. But land was so abundant
                            that a thrifty younger son often earned in a lifetime a better portion
                            than his elder brother. The eldest son's double portion in New England
                            survived the Revolution for some years. A very ancient mode of
                            inheritance prevailed in some English boroughs, called among lawyers
                            "borough English." By this custom the lands descended to the youngest
                            son. It found no lodgment in the laws of the colonies, so far as I know;
                            but in New Hampshire it was a widespread custom to leave the homestead
                            to the youngest, who remained at home and cared for the old age of his
                            parents. This reasonable form of the custom of "ultimogeniture" lingers
                            yet in certain parts of the country, as, for example, in some of the
                            northern counties of New York. The other custom of a widow inheriting a
                            third of her husband's estate is even more widely prevalent, and is a
                            matter of law in most of the States.</p>

                            ears. They were sent a-wandering, living as they could live by hook or
                            by crook. Necessity made many of them rogues, and the desire to have
                            done with rogues was so intense that England hanged its thieves out of
                            hand. Henry VIII thought to be rid of such vermin of society, and he
                            hanged, if we may believe Harrison, two-and-seventy thousand, including
                            "great theeves, pettie theeves and roges." In Elizabeth's reign three or
                            four hundred felons were eaten up annually by the gallows, and James I
                            merrily carried on the work of extermination; one reads of "twenty
                            hanged up at a clap," in one place. But the vagabonds did not grow
                            fewer.</p>
                        <p>Recent serfdom had left its mark on the poor man. He had been freed, not
                            from benevolence, nor from any motive having regard to the personality
                            of the serf. Wickliffe and others had taught that it was meritorious to
                            free a man from bondage who was a Christianthat is, who had been
                            baptized. This scruple fitted to the churchly conscience of the age; it
                            grew more and more exigeant. "We think it pious and meritorious with God
                            to make certain persons absolutely free from the yoke of servitude who
                            are at present under villenage to us," said Henry VIII. Elizabeth and
                            James, less scrupulous on this point, proposed to sell to those whose
                            blood was tainted with slavery the privileges of freedom. It was not

                            <pb id="VAA2405-306" n="295"/> eighteenth century had dawned that
                            Chamberlayne's State of England, an annual publication, could drop its
                            set phrase, "but few now in England," and say, "Now slavery is entirely
                            thrown away and every Servant Man or Woman are properly hired Servants."
                            But the habit of regarding the peasant as a recent serf had its
                            influence in the treatment of him.</p>
                        <p>The "spirit," who was later called a crimp, was on the watch for him. Did
                            they need more soldiers in Flanders? The spirit, by means best known to
                            himself, packed off the poor man to Flanders. He was equally ready to
                            ship him to any other country for a reward. The Virginia colony began to
                            ask for people. The wilderness was hungry for laborers. The spirit
                            shipped little children by the score down the Thames and off for
                            America. Parents followed the vessels all the way to Gravesend, but the
                            law would not help them; Virginia wanted laborers. Sometimes a parent
                            could pay enough to get the lad released. Men were carried also to that
                            abode of hopelessness. From the first there were two general classes:
                            free apprentices and convicts mostly for petty crimes. "Apprentices,"
                            says Chamberlayne, "are a sort of servant that carry the mask of Pure
                            villains or Bond slaves, differing however in that Apprentices are
                            slaves only for a term and by covenant."</p>

                        <p>From the outset there were in New England as well as in Virginia
                            apprenticed servants, who had been bound for a long term before leaving
                            England, and were treated as a recognized species of property. Winthrop
                            speaks of the "money" the three hundred servants had cost that they were
                            enforced to set free for want of food. Cradock and others who did not
                            come to New England sent servants to take care of estates for them. In
                            1629 De Vries, the Dutch traveler, saw English men and women staked and
                            lost at cards, and he bluntly told the Virginians that he had "never
                            seen such work in Turk or Barbarian." George Donne, the author of a
                            manuscript in the Bodleian, saw servants brought to Virginia by the
                            shipload after 1630, and he describes the horrors of the traffic, their
                            insufficient food, their ragged and barefoot condition, and their
                            landing far from their destination and being forced to march the rest of
                            the way in their enfeebled state. Nearly all the emigrants that came
                            between 1620 and 1650 were bondsmen. This does not imply that they were
                            not some of them educated, for many Latin-school men were obliged to
                            sell themselves to the crimp. After the Restoration servants were sold
                            in great numbers to Virginia. Fifteen hundred a year is the estimate of
                            Berkeley at a time when Virginia contained but two thousand black
                            slaves. As the term was for four years, there were six thousand <note

                            Before 1650 the term of some was ten years or more, and that of many was
                            seven or eight years. After the restoration of the Stuarts in 1660 the
                            term of service was permanently reduced to four years.</p>

                        <p>English laborers bound themselves to serve a term of years, fairly hoping
                            to better their condition in America; and men in domestic or other
                            trouble would sell themselves for a term of service in the plantations,
                            plunging into the abyss and trusting to luck to come up in better plight
                            in a new world. Husbands forsaking their wives lost their identity in
                            the transport ship, and wives fleeing from unbearable husbands were
                            swallowed up in the flood. Runaway children and fleeing apprentices were
                            greedily welcomed by the crimps; felons and prison breakers pursued by
                            hue and cry were quickly safe on board. In those days of slow
                            communication, renegades of every sort were as utterly lost to their old
                            lives in America as they could have been had they migrated to the moon.
                            It was an age of flogging; criminals, soldiers, sailors, pupils,
                            children, and now and then even wives, were thought the better for
                            scourging. One ought hardly to be surprised, therefore, at the numerous
                            and cruel whippings of English servants, women as well as men, who were

                            sometimes at intervals for hours, or being renewed day after day. There
                            were also in use, by masters and overseers, thumbscrews, sweatings, and
                            other such devil's devices. The food allowed was sometimes a scant diet
                            of Indian meal. The sick servant was neglected lest the doctor's charge
                            should exceed the value of his remaining service; and one thrifty master
                            in Maryland required a servant, sick of a mortal disease, to dig his own
                            grave in advance, in order to save the other men's time. In 1705
                            Virginia prohibited the secret burial of servants and the whipping of
                            "Christian white servants" naked, without the consent of a justice.
                            Great numbers fled away from the sharpness of bondage, taking the risk
                            of cruel punishments and an extension of their terms if captured. During
                            the existence of New Netherland, Dutch servants broke away to New
                            England or Maryland, while English servants from both directions made
                            their way to the Dutch territory. With New England the Dutch had at one
                            time a treaty for the return of those "who carried their passports under
                            their feet." To get away on shipboard, to seize a shallop and make off
                            to a neighboring colony, and represent themselves as shipwrecked
                            mariners, and to fly to the Indians, were favorite devices of runaways.
                            So great was the number of fugitives that "inferior persons" were always
                            liable to arrest on suspicion. North Carolina was filled with runaways
                            from Virginia. In 1663 a dangerous conspiracy of indentured servants

                            fear of the class, among whom were many desperate characters, probably
                            prompted much of the severe treatment inflicted on bondmen. The Pilgrims
                            found that servants led astray "the unstaid and young." The
                            Massachusetts colonists before starting essayed at considerable cost to
                            sift their servants, excluding a corrupt element; they even sent back
                            two boys who had shown vicious propensities on shipboard. But the large
                            proportion of penalties meted out to servants during the first years of
                            the colonies shows how slight was the effect of the sifting process.
                            Even in the colonies where the convict element was shut out, many of the
                            servants were obtained from dangerous classes, such as "sturdy beggars,
                            gypsies, and other incorrigible rogues, idle and debauched persons."
                            They could "eat till they sweat and work till they freeze," in the
                            quaint words of a traveler in New England. It was probably from those
                            who had been servants that the sea rovers fitting out in the colonies
                            found recruits. The pirate James, when short of hands, lay off the
                            Virginia coast and captured transport ships, many of the convicts and
                            servants in them preferring to risk a halter in cruising "on the grand
                            account" to pining in colonial bondage. In some instances the criminal
                            transports rose and slaughtered the crew, taking the ship into some
                            out-of-the-way harbor and escaping. The degradation of the women
                            servants was a continual source of evil; laws were made to correct their
                            immoralities, and other laws <pb id="VAA2405-311" n="300"/> to prevent
                            these "Christians" from intermarrying with the heathen Africans. In all
                            the colonies there were those brought as servants, even as convicts, who
                            rose to wealth through industry and frugality, two virtues on which a
                            new land pays high premium. Some founded families that attained to honor

                        <p>The severity of English penal laws occasioned evasions of all kinds; for
                            Anglo-Saxon people prefer to reform an abuse by avoidance rather than by
                            direct abolition. The old provision for "benefit of clergy" was
                            stretched to an absurd comprehensiveness. The need for men in the
                            colonies offered a new opportunity for merciful evasions of the death
                            penalty in cases of minor felony. It became common to pardon thieves on
                            condition, of their accepting a seven years' term of service in the
                            colonies, and the English State-Paper Office has many curious petitions
                            for this commutation. As early as 1622 a horse thief indicates that he
                            much prefers service in Virginia to hanging. At a later period a husband
                            is found petitioning on behalf of his wife, condemned to death for
                            stealing three-and-sixpence, that she might be transported to any
                            plantation. After the Restoration it was enacted that justices, at their
                            discretion, might send "loose and disorderly persons" to the colonies,
                            and at intervals a hundred or so of "Newgate birds" were taken in a

                        <p>Bristol was the chief center of the colonial trade; here even the small
                            traders and sometimes the peddlers had ventures in the colonies.
                            Bristol, therefore, naturally took the lead in the servant trade, and
                            most of the great officers of the city became involved in kidnapping.
                            When, in Bristol, a man was on trial for some small crime, the petty
                            officers would persuade him to beg for transportation in order to escape
                            being hanged. These transports were then assigned to the mayor and each
                            of the aldermen in turn, who sold them to the plantations, and grew rich
                            from the spoils of the poor and the desperate. In the most paradoxical
                            scene in judicial history the worst of judges, George Jeffreys, himself
                            reeking with corruptions and cruelties incredible, is found arraigning
                            aldermen of this opulent city for their share in this trade. Ordering
                            the scarlet-robed mayor from his seat on the bench to a place in the
                            prisoner's dock, he cried, with brutal exultation, "See how the
                            kidnapping rogue looks !" He ranted at the aldermen in words too vile to
                            be reprinted. Yet the selling of condemned men and the condemning of men

                        <p>In 1619 a "Holland man-of-war," short of water and food, put into the
                            James River, and cast anchor before the only English settlement on this
                            side of the globe. The captain was forbidden to land, but as he
                            threatened to throw overboard some slaves captured in the West Indies,
                            Captain Kendall, commanding at Jamestown, exchanged some "presents" for
                            them. These fourteen "negars" were the first slaves in English America.
                            The opening of new settlements and the lighting upon new staple products
                            produced a demand for unskilled labor which the English "spirits" or
                            crimps could not adequately supply. Negroes were therefore brought from
                            the West Indies, and afterward direct from Africa or Madagascar. The
                            labor of slaves increased the ability of the colonies to "take off"
                            English goods; it is therefore not surprising that a Committee on
                            Foreign Plantations, soon after the Restoration, declared that "black
                            slaves were the most useful appurtenances of a plantation."</p>
                        <p>The English serfs had received their freedom chiefly on theological
                            grounds as fellow-Christians, with some additional weight thrown into
                            the scale by their being fellow-Englishmen. But freeborn Englishmen were
                            by custom sold into severe bondage for long terms, and even sent beyond

                            seem to be another species, not entitled to human consideration. At

                        <p>Slavery is more ancient than historic records. In the centuries of
                            warfare between Christians and Mohammedans, the practice of enslaving
                            captives outlawed by their "infidelity" had prevailed. Negroes were
                            easily confounded with the Moors, and thousands of blacks were annually
                            brought into Europe for sale as early as the middle of the fifteenth
                            century; and a century later, in 1553, one finds four-and-twenty of them
                            brought as far as England. From Spain first, and then directly from
                            Africa, black slaves had been carried to the Spanish colonies to develop
                            the mines. The Royal African Company of England announced to Charles II,
                            in 1663, that the very existence of the plantations depended on an
                            adequate supply of negro servants; and though their declaration was due
                            to cupidity, it was at least true that all rich and successful American
                            colonies up to this time had possessed slaves. So late as 1735 the Lords

                            <pb id="VAA2405-315" n="304"/> Commissioners of Trade declared that the
                            colonies "could not possibly subsist" without an adequate supply of
                            slaves. Indeed, the first effect of the introduction of slaves was a
                            rapid advancement in subduing forests and opening sources of wealth.</p>
                        <p>For nearly sixty years after the beginning of negro slavery here, there
                            seems to have been no scruple or question about it. The lifelong bondage
                            of negroes was tacitly justified by their heathen condition. When, in
                            1677, the question was first raised in an English court, Africans were
                            held to be slaves by the custom of merchants and "as being infidels."
                            This notion was so general that very many planters resisted efforts to
                            instruct their slaves in the Christian religion, lest baptism should
                            emancipate them. To remove this obstacle the Virginia Assembly had
                            enacted, in 1667, that the conversion of a slave should not invalidate
                            the owner's claim to his services, and similar laws were afterward made
                            in most of the other provinces. But these laws were merely of colonial
                            authority, and were not sufficient to overcome the scruple of
                            covetousness. A proposal from England to encourage the conversion of the
                            negroes "would not go down" with the New York Assembly in 1699.
                            Philanthropic exertion for the negro was at first wholly religious,
                            seeking his conversion not so much for the good of the negro as for the
                            glory of Christianity. The attention of James II having been called to
                            the pagan condition of the negroes, he resolved at the council board, in
                            1685, <pb id="VAA2405-316" n="305"/> that all the slaves in the
                            plantation should be christened; the thought of baptizing them in a mass
                            by royal order, whether they would or no, was no doubt doubly pleasing
                            to him as a zealot and as a lover of arbitrary methods. Efforts to
                            convert the slaves in the seventeenth century were few and languid, the
                            most notable being those of the superannuated Eliot, in Massachusetts.
                            There were a few individuals who, like William Penn in 1700, had "a
                            concern for the souls of the blacks "; but many held them to be quite
                            without souls, and hence not proper objects of concern.</p>

                        <p>The first voice in America to speak against the perpetual bondage of man
                            to man was heard in a memorial of some Friends of Germantown in
                            Pennsylvania. This protest, in vigorous broken English, was addressed to
                            the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting in 1688, and it opened an agitation
                            which resulted, seventy years later, in bringing the Philadelphia
                            Quakers to a conclusion opposed to slaveholding. In the fundamental law
                            of Massachusetts and Connecticut, villanage and other feudal servitudes
                            were prohibited, and in 1646 the Massachusetts General Court actually
                            undertook to send back to Africa negroes who had been kidnapped by a
                            slaver, and to send with them a letter of apology and explanation. But
                            the Calvinist reverence for the law of Moses was a less elastic <note

                            followers of Fox. If the early Puritan, bound to the letter of
                            Scripture, was less likely to run into aberrant fanaticism than the
                            Friend, he was also less quick to gain new and modern views of duty.
                            Refusing to participate with "man-stealers," the textual conscience of
                            the Massachusetts forefathers did not shrink from selling Indians
                            captured in war into chattel slavery, or from buying slaves who appeared
                            to have come into bondage otherwise than by downright kidnapping. These
                            nice distinctions could not be kept up, and thousands of negro slaves
                            were sold into New England without any question for conscience' sake.
                            The scruple about human liberty with which the Puritan forefathers had
                            come to this country had been swiftly forgotten. Some merchants of
                            Boston were engaged in the Guinea trade, of which, however, Newport was
                            the great center. Before the antislavery writings of the Quakers,
                            Hepburn, Burling, Lay, and Sandiford, had appeared, an influential but
                            rather timid voice, that of Judge Sewall, was heard opposing the
                            importation of slaves to Massachusetts. He had been led by the narrow
                            theological spirit in which he was bred into grievous mistakes in the
                            witchcraft trials, but he was an honest and even a scrupulous man. Fond
                            of popular favor and shrinking from censure, it cost him a struggle no
                            doubt to give to the press, in 1700, his little tract against the slave
                            trade, entitled The Selling of Joseph. Its influence was probably not
                            great.</p>

                            Denton's Brief Description of New York: "These persons being thus
                            qualified settle the place and take in what inhabitants to themselves
                            they shall see cause to admit of until their Town be full; these
                            associates thus taken in have equal privileges with themselves and they
                            make a division of the Land suitable to every man's occasions, no man
                            being debarr'd of such quantities as he hath occasion for, the rest they
                            let lie in common till they have occasion for a new division, never
                            dividing their Pastureland at all which lies in common to the whole
                            Town." There is some ambiguity in Denton's description, and the towns
                            may refer themselves to New Jersey and New York. An instance of village
                            community of French origin is found in Parkrnan's Discovery of the Great
                            West, p. 7. Here there are town lots with arable land outside of the

                            of a common for a new town. This was the usual course of procedure. Long
                            before this time it is probable that manors were given up. Copley to
                            Lord Baltimore, April 3, 1638, in Calvert papers, makes a strong
                            statement of the difficulty of maintaining them in Maryland.</p>

                            etc. This bears date February 3, 1618 (1619), and was no doubt the model
                            on which many grants were made at that time. It indicated a liberal gift
                            of local autonomy hardly to be realized without the granting of township
                            government or of government by the borough or hundred. The colony of
                            Virginia was to have no jurisdiction except in case of "tryals of
                            matters of Justice by appeale or otherwise." This was precisely the case

                            the way into the interior. Commons they are to-day, but the title and
                            the thing are passing into swift forgetfulness. Boston Common remains a
                            part of the original common land of the town, and there are some others.</p>

                            no doubt begun somewhat earlier. In 1513 a law of Henry VIII prescribes
                            that the "pulling downe and destruction of townes within this realm, and
                            laying to pasture lands which customably have been manured and occupyed
                            wyth tythage and husbandry," should be restored. So the succeeding acts
                            of 24 and 25 Henry VIII. The reformer Becon denounces the "wrong they
                            have done to the poor commons, as by making common pastures several to
                            themselves," etc. Fortress of the Faithful, 598. The character of
                            Latimer's sermons against the abuse is well known. In 1549 the peasantry
                            rose in an endeavor to restore the commons. Harrison says in 1577 that
                            some "daily do make beggars inough whereby to pester the land espieng a
                            further commoditie in their commons, holds, tenures, dooth find such
                            meanes as therby to wipe many out of their occupiengs, and turne the
                            same unto his private gaines." Holinshed, i, 308. In 1607 riots are
                            noted against inclosures of commons and wastes. Nichol's Poor Laws, 232.
                            There is a sermon on the Rainbow preached at Paul's Cross in 1617 by
                            Bourne, in which he graphically says: "Depopulators have inclosed
                            fields, townes, churches, and all, pulling those down which their
                            religious forefathers did build up, stopping doores with thornes and
                            their windows with brushes; yea, covering their roofs with thatch; nay,
                            leaving them naked or else turning these holy places into barnes or
                            sheepcoates or other prophane uses," p. 47. See also Stafford's A Brief
                            Conceipt of English Pollicy, 1632. Harleian Miscell. ix, 199. The
                            extracts that might be quoted are all but innumerable, but Marshall in
                            1786 shall end these where he says that the spirit of inclosure is such
                            that in half a century more an open field or undivided common may be
                            rare. It was the cry of oppression at first, when the change to sheep
                            farming was made. Selden says Depopulatio Agrorum is a great offense in
                            the common law. And yet this revolution in agriculture, so unjustly
                            enforced, was beneficial to England. The peasants thrown out to beg
                            lived or died according to their shiftiness. The cruel law of natural
                            selection destroyed those unable to adapt themselves; human advancement
                            is pitiless and unforgiving.</p>
                        <p>Chamberlayne's State of England, All the volumes after 1710 say of
                            villanage, "But this kind of tenure is in a manner out of use."I am
                            aware that this brings serfdom further down than the authorities by a
                            hundred and fifty years. The copy I consulted lacked the volumes between
                            1702 and 1708, but the change <note id="note_904" place="unspecified"

                            went out before this time; it had practically been out of use for long
                            generations.</p>
                        <p>Servants hired or apprenticed "were subject to be corrected by their
                            Master or Mistress, and resistance by a servant is punished with some
                            severe penalty," says Chamberlayne. A fatal blow from a servant to a
                            master was petty treason, and brought on him capital punishment. He had
                            no redress for ill treatment. The hired servant as well as the
                            apprentice might be sold for his unexpired time. He must work for a
                            price fixed by others, and no man would hire him without the permission
                            of his former master. He was a slave for a time in all but name. Any
                            combination on the part of the employed looking to a strike was
                            treasonable.</p>
