				<lb/>
				<p>The history of the hotels of South Bend has in several instances been given more or less
					attention through the local newspapers and otherwise. If the present effort in the same
					direction should show in some particulars more detail and closer approach to accuracy, it
					will be owing solely to the fact that more time and patience have been given to the matter
					than would be practicable in the rush of ordinary newspaper work. Yet I do not by any
					means flatter myself that my narrative is exhaustive or free from error. To the end that
					the facts and impressions given may be made as trustworthy as possible, candid acclaim is
					earnestly invited.</p>
				<p>Within its first decade there were altogether eleven taverns operated in the town. Just
					when the first two of these were opened may not at present be easily determined. The
					earliest documentary evidence on the subject known to the writer is to be found in the
					records of the county commissioner's court, where, at their first September session, 1831,
					Calvin Lilly, Benjamin Coquillard, and Peter Johnson were each granted a license for this
					purpose. On November 12th, following, the advertisements of Lilly and Coquillard appeared
					in the Northwestern Pioneer, this being the second number of that newspaper, the first
					number being missing from the preserved file. Lilly's place is said to have been the first
					and Coquillard's the second, both dating back to 1830. These claims appear to be based
					solely upon tradition and cannot now be verified. Both Lilly and Coquillard boarded some
					of Brookfield's men when he was surveying the Town Plat in the spring of 1831, which may
					signify, as far as it goes, that they were keeping tavern at that date.</p>
				<pb id="VAC1111-003" n="2"/>
				<div2 type="part">
					<head rend="center">SOUTH BEND INN</head>
					<p>Mr. Lilly's announcement runs as follows: <q rend="blockquote"><p rend="center">"SOUTH
								BEND INN"</p><lb/>
							<p><hi rend="center">CALVIN LILLY</hi><lb/> Has opened a House of Public Entertainment
								on St. Joseph Street. His table is furnished with the best the country will
								afford-his Bar is supplied with the choicest of Liquors and his Stable with
								Provender. No exertion will be wanting to render general satisfaction to those who
								may favor him with a call."</p></q></p>
					<p>This building stood on the northeast corner of Lot 37, which is the irregular tract
						lying southwest of Vistula Avenue, and west of St. Joseph Street. The property seems to
						have belonged to Edmund Pitt Taylor, who advertises the same for sale April 17, 1832,
						possession to be given May 1, and describes it as "a good Frame House, 2 stories high,
						with a brick seller-likewise a 2 story hewed 'Log House and Kitchen' well calculated for
						a public stand and situated in as beautiful and pleasant a part of the town, as any
						other. The lot is 200 feet front on Pearl Street."</p>
					<p>On May 22, 1832, the Northwestern Pioneer makes the following announcement: "The
						Printing Office has been removed to the second story of the house formerly occupied as a
						tavern by Mr. Lilly, on the corner of St. Joseph and Pearl Sts." St. Joseph street is
						here mentioned first, which may have some significance, indicating that this was then
						the principal street, the Michigan road not having been erected, and the 'Dragoon Trace'
						between Ft. Wayne and Chicago at that time crossing Bowman's Creek near the present
						Henry Studebaker's barn, intersecting the St. Joseph Street at about Wayne St., and then
						following the former down to Pearl. The place was now certainly vacated as a hotel. I
						have not been able to find out anything of its subsequent history. If part of the
						building was a frame, as is stated, it was most likely the first of the kind in the
						state north of Logansport. E. P. Taylor, the owner, as is well known, was a brother of
						Lathrop M. Taylor, one of the founders of the town, and came to this locality not long
						after his brother. Most people of today remember 'Pitts' Taylor best as the owner of a
						sawmill on the west race, and his immense log piles on and about the present site of the
						standpipe and over the adjacent bluff.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="part">
					<head rend="center">UNION HALL</head>
					<p>This 'House of Public Entertainment' in the language of that day, was owned by Benjamin
						Coquillard, brother of the older Alexis, and father of the late Alexis, the well-known
						capitalist and wagon manufacturer. The building stood on the site of the L. F. Baker
						rooms attached to the rear of the present Citizens' National Bank. Some say the location
						was on the point across the alley; but that is hardly probable, for Mr. Coquillard did
						not own any ground there, and it is not likely he would have built on ground <pb
							id="VAC1111-004" n="3"/> belonging to somebody else, especially as his brother was
						half-owner of the whole town plat. The frame that preceded the present brick that was
						long known as the Harris corner, was built in 1838 by William H. Patterson; and now
						modified in external appearance, stands on the northeast corner of Jefferson and St.
						Joseph streets. Mr. Patterson was long a merchant in South Bend, was recorder of the
						county, and always a staunch pillar of the Baptist church. The late "Deacon" Hatch
						called him "Praying Billy." The two were partners. They did business, as Hatch was wont
						to say, according to the scriptures; they watched and prayed, Billy doing the praying
						and Hatch the watching. Humble as the Union Hall was in itself, it was nevertheless
						quite ambitious in its pretentions. The proprietor, in his advertisement, "hopes, by his
						long experience in the business, to give general satisfaction to those who may favor him
						with a call. His table is furnished with the best the country affords. His bar is
						supplied with the choicest of liquors." His advertisement appears in the same issue of
						the paper as Lilly's though it has been claimed-I know not on what authority-that the
						South Bend Inn was the first to begin business. It is not probable that his career as
						mine host was long continued. At any rate his last license was issued in September 1832
						and on November 10, following, the title passed to his brother Alexis, he having held it
						exactly one year.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="part">
					<head rend="center">LILLY'S TAVERN</head>
					<p>Calvin Lilly, in 1831, purchased of the original proprietors Lots 28, 29, and 30 which
						comprise the block lying on the west side of Michigan street between Jefferson and the
						first alley north, being 198 feet by 165, or three-fourths of an acre. On this property
						he erected a one and one-half story frame house which occupied the frontage now covered
						by the Lippman Clothing Store and the Kuntsman Saloon. The proprietor took out a tavern
						license for this stand at the September term. It was in the bar room of this
						establishment that the first Circuit Court of the county was held on October 22, 1832,
						with Hon. John R. Porter as the president judge. The session lasted but a single day.
						The first case was a divorce suit and was successful, thus establishing a reputation for
						the state in this line which it has since zealously sustained. The second case was for
						libel, and the third the prosecution of a woman for selling liquor to the Indians. I
						believe a son of this defendant learned his trade as a tanner with Mr. Bugbee, and is
						now, if living, a respected citizen of one of the flourishing county seats of Northern
						Indiana, having, represented the county in the legislature for one or more sessions. Mr.
						Lilly appeared at the commissioner's court for a tavern licensed the last time at the
						May term 1834. On March 9, 1835, he sold to John Fowler and went his way to swell the
						tide as the star of empire takes its way. From my rather cursory examination of the
						record, Mr. Fowler appears to have held but one license as tavern-keeper, this having
						been issued at the September term 1855. What happened here for several years suceeding
						this date, I have been unable to learn. But in 1837, Mr. Almond Bugbee, to whom I am <pb
							id="VAC1111-005" n="4"/> indebted for much of the information used in this article,
						boarded at the place, the location being indicated by a large swinging sign which bore,
						in sharp relief, the, at that day, anomolous legend, "TEMPERANCE HOUSE." By the way, in
						passing, it may be remarked that while drinking may have been quite as at present, the
						cause of temperance was then perhaps given much more serious attention. Early in this
						very year, the Rev. Alfred Bryant was at the head of a temperance movement which
						received 156 signatures, among which were those of the father, mother, two uncles and an
						aunt of the writer. These, indeed, needed no such formality for self-protection; for not
						one of them touched, tasted or handled. Of that 156 whose names were thus enrolled, but
						one remains to tell the story. He had been in the village but a few weeks. The letters
						T.T.A follow his signature, meaning teetotalabstinence, a designation he has ever since
						maintained, in letter and in spirit. It goes without saying that I refer to our
						well-preserved and highly esteemed octogenarian, Almond Bugbee. I do not know how long
						Mr. Fowler kept the Temperance House. The last occupant of the place in the Forties was
						James Doan, who was a blacksmith at the end of the West Race, and made the first steel
						plow known in Northern Indiana. He crossed the plains in 1849, the entire distance on
						foot. A year or two later his body, still warm, was found on the trail between Carson
						Valley and Placerville, where he had been murderdered and robbed. Mr. Fowler sold all
						his real estate to David Stover and moved to California. To the latter gentleman I am
						also indebted for much old-time data, and who, hale and hearty, at four score and four,
						now resides at his cozy semi-country home near Springbrook Park. Mr. Fowler had several
						sons and one or more daughters. One of the daughters was the mother of the Listenberger
						brothers, Albert and Miner. Alexander, the second son, was a Mexican war veteran, and
						lost a thumb at the storming of the Heights of Cerro Gordo. He also made an honorable
						record as a colonel of infantry in the war for the Union. The building, according to
						Judge Turner in his "Gazetteer of St. Joseph Valley" was moved to Jefferson St. and used
						as a warehouse for the Studebaker Wagon Works. I know not what became of it afterward,
						but I believe it to be a part of the livery stable on West Jefferson St.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="part">
					<head rend="center">MICHIGAN HOTEL</head>
					<p>The Michigan Hotel was situated on the corner known as the Coonley drug store. It was
						erected by Peter Johnson, grandfather of Thad S. Taylor, and several years later, an
						associate judge. Mr. Johnson moved with his family to South Bend from Logansport early
						in 1831. Ice was still in the Tippecanoe and in Yellow river, but was too rotten for
						safe crossing; so that Indian canoes had to be obtained with which to ferry. The trail
						from the south then swung to the westward through what is now Liberty and Greene
						townships, this county, to avoid the lakes, marshes, and heavy timber on the direct
						route, afterward taken by the Michigan road. Mr. Johnson was a practical carpenter and
						builder, and began at <pb id="VAC1111-006" n="5"/> once the erection of his hotel and
						stable, the latter on the alley at the west end of the lot. The main building was a
						two-story structure, and may still be seen at 215 West Navarre St. There was also a wing
						attached, which fronted on Washington St. The license was granted to commence August 1,
						that year. The same season Mr. Johnson built the "Fairplay", which was the first keel
						boat to gladden the waters of the St. Joseph. Washington St. between Michigan and Main
						was his ship-yard. Here he erected the necessary scaffolding upon which he mounted the
						largest pirogue available. This he split in two with a whip-saw. Then oak plank of the
						proper length were ripped out in like manner and bent to match the contour of the boat
						along the line of its cleavage. Now, with the knees, beams, calking, pitching,
						running-board, enclosing, pike-poles and rudder-sweep, the boat was launched for
						service. Mr. Johnson was also the contractor and builder of our first court house.</p>
					<p>In 1834, the license for this house was issued in the name of Mr. William L. Earl,
						father of Mrs. A. B. Merritt, of this city, and Wm. L. and Daniel Earl of California.
						Mr. Earl was previously a partner with Alanson M. Hurd in the iron works and town plat
						of Mishawaka, and was keeping tavern there, says Mrs. Merritt, at the time of the great
						meteoric shower, in 1833. He alleged that Hurd swindled him out of his interests in that
						locality. In 1835, when the United States Land Office was opened at La Porte, the
						Michigan Hotel did a thriving business. At the September term, 1836, Mr. Earl took out a
						license for Earl's Tavern, a stand which he erected that season at the present site of
						Lakeville, he having purchased for this purpose a forty acre tract of Jacob Rector,
						grandfather of our Attorney J. D. Henderson. In the same year Mr. Johnson sold the
						Michigan Hotel property to one Charles Thrasher, and built a sawmill on the edge of the
						bluff at the rear of the present residence of Hon. J. B. Stoll. This was the first
						attempt to employ steam power for manufacturing purposes in St. Joseph county, and the
						experiment proved a dismal failure. It cost more for fuel than the mill could earn.
						Daniel Gephart appears to have kept the hotel for a short time, having taken out a
						license at the September term, 1836. Levi Wills followed; then John Mowry and Isaac M.
						Baldwin, September 1837; several months after, Levi Wills again, in January, 1838. Mr.
						Wills, it may here be stated, afterward kept "Our House" at Mt. Pleasant, this county.
						In 1850 he crossed the plains to California. There he engaged in supplying some of the
						Hangtown markets with beef cattle, and soon after was killed by a wild steer. The hotel
						property was sold December 12, 1837, by Mr. Thrasher to Abram R. and John H. Harper and
						John N. Smith. On February 27, 1838, a permit was granted these proprietors to occupy
						for 120 days a part of Michigan street opposite this lot and the one adjoining on the
						south for making improvements on this property. What these improvements were does not
						appear; perhaps the erection of the wing to the west was one of them. It was the
						Harpers, probably, that changed the name to American Hotel, a name borne on its large
							<pb id="VAC1111-007" n="6"/> swinging sign to the close of its career. In 1838,
						Renatus N. Koehler came to South Bend from Pennsylvania, and clerked in Harper's store
						for awhile. In January, 1839, he and Thomas Duey, having formed a partnership, rented
						the hotel and ran it till November 1840. Then the Harper brothers themselves carried on
						the business, and later Abram took charge alone. In January 1845, the smallpox broke out
						in the village and spread to an alarming extent. From first to last there were about
						seventy-five victims and the percentage of fatalities was very great. Some of the
						patients were quartered in this hotel and Harper, rather than have these taken to the
						pest house, had the doors closed. Louis Comparet, brother of Mrs. Alexis Coquillard, and
						long a noted wit of the town, had a very severe attack of varioloid among the earliest
						of the attacked. He recovered in season to be of much service in attending other
						patients, among these our ex-mayor, William Miller, who was at the American Hotel. Jacob
						N. Massey, happening to meet Louis on the street, inquired as to Miller's condition, and
						was told the case was very serious. Jacob was very pious; and his thoughts turning
						beyond things earthy, he asked Comparet whether he thought Miller would like to see a
						preacher. "Oh, yes! Oh, yes!" said Louie, seizing heartily upon the opportunity to
						perpetrate a joke. Jacob soon found the Rev. William Pratt, the Baptist minister here,
						brother of United States Senator Daniel D. Pratt, of Logansport. Both the preacher and
						the senator were men of giant frames and stentorian lungs. Preacher Pratt consented to
						serve without hesitation, although he may have wondered why Mr. Massey did not see his
						own preacher, Alfred Bryant, long the Presbyterian pastor here. Well, Mr. Pratt prepared
						himself for the ordeal as well as he could, covering his face with a bandana
						handkerchief. As he opened the door of the scourged chamber, Louis, now happening to be
						in and expecting a scene, slipped out. Pratt approached the bedside and asked Miller as
						to whether his services were desired, and was told that no such request had been made.
						Mr. Pratt then inquired whether he should come again, with the reply forthcoming that
						there was no necessity for him to thus expose himself. Nor did he. This story, with many
						variations, was for many years retailed as the stock joke of the town. I have given Mr.
						Miller's version of the incident, as he related it to me a few days ago. In 1847, August
						25, Koehler and Duey again became the landlords, and now the owners as well. Mr. Koehler
						was the actual head, as Mr. Duey, for his part, took charge of the farming interests of
						the firm.</p>
					<p>Another story was current about the town for many years, happening during this
						management. One James Mc Goggy, a carpenter, who had a terrible impediment of speech
						from a bad case of hare-lip, came into the bar room one day, in a state, seemingly, of
						great excitement. Elmer Rose was with him. Addressing Mr. Koehler, Mc Groggy went on to
						detail that Rose and he had just bet the drinks on a certain dispute between them, and
						asked <pb id="VAC1111-008" n="7"/> whether they could get the grog and pay for it when
						the wager was decided. Mr. Koehler, with his usual sagacity, set out the jug. Both
						quaffed down a generous potation. Mc Goggy now proceeded to explain, "Well, Mr.
						Koehler," said he, "Elmer and I were looking at your sign-post out there and wondering
						which way it would fall when it rotted off at the bottom. We got to disputing about it
						and finally made the bet. I bet it would fall south, and Elmer, the damned fool, bet it
						would fall north." Of such were the wit and humor when the bar room was the social
						resort of the town. In 1850, Koehler and Duey sold the property to Captain Samuel L.
						Cottrell and the furnishings to Colonel Adam S. Baker, our now venerable townsman, of
						908 S. Michigan St. Mr. Baker kept the hotel till the Southern Michigan and Northern
						railroad was completed, which I think was in 1852. Daniel Haight and George Clark, his
						brother-in-law, next became the proprietors. They remained as such only about six
						months. Sylvanus G. Gaylord then operated it, probably till he and Lot Day, Jr.
						succeeded to the proprietorship of the St. Joseph hotel, which was on December 28, 1858.
						This seems to have been the last use made of the so-called American corner as a hotel.
						Indeed, the lower floor had for some time prior been used for merchandising by Ezekiel
						French and ----- Adams, and perhaps after them others. It was the longest-lived hotel
						known to South Bend, running as such for about a quarter of a century. The present
						three-story brick was erected in 1866 by Ex-Sheriff Solomon W. Palmer, Dr. George F.
						Nevius and James Bonney, the latter our veteran photographer.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="part">
					<head rend="center">EAGLE HOTEL</head>
					<p>I do not know much of this hostelry. It is one of the three hotels marked on the first
						map of South Bend, made, as would seem from some of its data, early in 1837. It was a
						story and a half frame that stood on the southeast corner of Lafayette and Washington
						streets, across from the present First Presbyterian church. The lot was purchssed of
						Samuel Hanna by Levi Barnes and Samuel C. Russ, jointly, on November 16, 1835. Both were
						carpenters and joiners, and doubtless put up the building. Samuel C. Russ was licensed
						to keep tavern here at the May term, 1836, and again at the September term, 1837. Russ
						was succeeded by John A. Prestana, who became owner of the property August 24, 1841.
						Prestana sold to Amable M. Lapierre, April 26, 1843, and moved from here to Chicago. Mr.
						Willis A. Bugbee remembers the family well and visited them in that city, they having a
						son about his age. Mr. La Pierre was a Frenchman and an ardent Methodist, although
						brought up a Catholic. He was a bricklayer and plasterer by trade, and was the head
						mason on the first college building put up at Notre Dame. The smallpox here in 1845
						marked him as one of its victims, and he carried a badly pitted face to his grave. He
						was also involved in the noted Norris fugitive slave case and I think, as a consequence,
						lost his property through process of the United <pb id="VAC1111-009" n="8"/> States
						court at Indianapolis. Later he removed to Niles, where he was gathered to his fathers
						some years ago. John M. Lapierre of 119 W. Marion street is his nephew. Mr. Bugbee
						boarded with Russ a while in 1837. His bedchamber was the loft with nothing between him
						and the star-bespangled firmament save the shingle roof, through which the snow often
						filtered with a liberality that did not always evoke joyous apostrophes to "the
						beautiful". There were flush times then. The Kankakee canal was in course of
						construction; so was the East race. Judge Garrett V. Dannister, who, with "Prince" John
						Van Buren, General Wm. J. Worth, of Mexican war renown, and others, was pushing the
						last-named enterprise, was one of the boarders. There were about twenty in all. The
						current rate was $3 for board and lodging, cheap enough, in all conscience, one would
						think, since most supplies were at that time as high or higher than at the present day.
						But, nevertheless, a dollar looked much larger than it does to our vision. Benjamin R.
						Hall was running the Exchange at the same time. He had syndicate ideas in his head, and
						organized a combination among the craft to advance the rate to $3.50. At once there
						arose a loud protest. The hotel patrons of the several establishments held a meeting and
						vigorous resolutions were adopted. Mr. Bugbee, backed by those of the Eagle Hotel,
						presented a series of these fulminations to his landlord, John Milligan, of the Free
						Press, got out fiery dodgers headed "Insurrection" and had them scattered about the
						streets. The big two-story Collmer building on Vistula avenue, built by Robert
						Wickersham, was rented and a man named Laribee engaged to take charge of it as a
						"community boarding house" for the irate 'insurrectionists' as they were pleased to call
						themselves. The upshot was a backdown on the part of the hotel keepers, a restoration of
						the old rate and the abandonment of the boarding house project. The Eagle Hotel building
						burned down a few years ago and the site is now graced with the elegant Kizer and
						Woolverton block occupied by the Eliel drug store.</p>

					<p>The Washington Block was the pride of the town in its day. The site was on Lot 19,
						which lies on the north side of Washington street from Main to the first alley east. The
						lot was purchased February 5, 1833, from State Senator Samuel Hanna, of Ft. Wayne, by
						Samuel Studebaker, who was the original owner of the Martin L. Wenger farm, now embraced
						within the city limits. March 1, 1836, Mr. Studebaker sold the same to Hiram Rush, but
						there being some deferred payments, the deed was not made out till 1840. Mr. Studebaker,
						dying meantime, the conveyance was executed by the late Judge Thomas S. Stanfield, as
						commissioner in chancery. Mr. Rush, immediately after the purchase in 1836, subdivided
						the lot into blocks fronting upon Washington street, about if not exactly, as marked off
						by the several buildings that occupy the ground today. The purchasers were James and Wm.
						Wickersham, Charles Egbert, F. J. and E. Townsend, and Wm. M. and John Parker. <pb
							id="VAC1111-010" n="9"/> The building was a frame, 60 feet deep by 145 feet long, the
						whole three stories above the ground with a basement. Thus extending from Main street
						east on Washington to within twenty feet of the alley, it was for that day and for so
						small a village a quite imposing structure, as its front elevation appeared in its white
						paint varied with window shutters in green. The two Wickershams owned three of the
						blocks, and were the prime movers of the enterprise. Both were carpenters and joiners,
						as was also their brother Robert, and these three did the bulk of the work, William
						superintending and doing the laying out. Ralph Staples arrived in the village just as
						the rafters were being placed, and thereafter was a conspicuous figure on the job. From
						that time forward for many years there were few buildings requiring carpenter work,
						hereabouts, either in town or county, that Ralph did not have a hand in their
						construction. Sixty-two feet of the west end of the building in question was planned and
						fitted up for a hotel and took the name Washington House, which it bore to the end. It
						was owned by the two Wickershams, James and William. The first license for the tavern,
						as such called in the official records, was taken out by William and Robert Gephart at
						the September term, 1837; but the establishment was opened August 1, the previous month.
						Andrew Simmons succeeded the Gepharts, taking out the county license in his name at the
						March term, 1838, while the town incorporation license was issued to Alva Simmons, his
						wife, May 15, following. Simmons was keeping the place as early as February 3, that
						year, at which date David Scott took breakfast there and had his horse fed, after having
						foully murdered and robbed his friend Joshua Copeland on Rolling Prairie. Mr. Bugbee at
						the same time did some repairing on Scott's bridle. Scott was overhauled at Edwardsburg,
						taken back to La Porte, tried, convicted, and hanged in the presence of an immense
						concourse of people. Gephart and Richmond were the next proprietors, their license being
						dated September 1838. The next license was issued to Robert Gephart at the May term,
						1839. On December 12, the same year, Mary Gephart, widow of Daniel and mother of Robert
						and William, figures as the proprietress through an advertisement of the hotel furniture
						and fixtures for sale. From the spring of 1840 for several years the stand seems not to
						have been occupied. At least, definite data is not at present known. Chauncey S. Fassett
						and John Hooper each take the station as mine host here for awhile, but exactly when or
						how long have not been ascertained. I interviewed a lady in this city on the subject.
						She was married in 1844, and at once took rooms in the Washington House, occupying them
						for a year or more. Mr. Fassett, she said, kept the hotel during that time. From Mr.
						Bugbee's abstracts of titles, which he kindly allowed me to consult, we learn that Mr.
						Hooper purchased an interest in the property February 13, 1845, and that he sold this
						interest to Stephen Field's December 18, 1847. If this period of part ownership affords
						any clue to Mr. <pb id="VAC1111-011" n="10"/> Hooper's occupancy, it is about all I have
						been able to find, except that the lady to whom I have just referred stated that he was
						living there at the time of the death of his mother-in-law, Mrs. Smith. Mr. Defrees, the
						accommodating sexton of the city cemetery, at my request, found the proper inscription
						on Mrs. Smith's tombstone in the Hooper lot. I have a distinct personal recollection of
						seeing Mr. Fassett then. We lived on a farm three or four miles distant from town. He
						was the customer for the butter we had to spare, paying ten cents per pound by the year
						whatever the current price. I was attending school in town, living at home and walking
						back and forth for the sake of muscular development. I sometimes had to carry the dairy
						product to boot. But I do not recall the date. Nor do I remember even having seen Mr.
						Hooper about that place. In 1848, "Black" John Rush succeeded to the proprietorship, his
						advent as such being duly heralded in The Register, in which, under the date of February
						18, he announces that he has rented the hotel, "refurnished and refitted it up in the
						most convenient style". This was the first instance after 1832 that any direct reference
						to any hotel in South Bend had been found, and afforded much relief, as the musty pages
						of The Register and of the few stray copies of The Free Press were being eagerly
						searched. Mr. Rush kept the place till March 3, 1849, when the ownership passed to John
						Grannis and John Hammond. Mr. Rush, wife and two daughters crossed the plains to
						California in 1850, the two former dying of cholera in Sacramento shortly after their
						arrival. The oldest daughter, Julia, married William L. Earle and lived in Jolon,
						California. Mr. Hammond became the active manager of the hotel and became its sole owner
						till it went into "innocuous desuetude" as Grover Cleveland would say. This was probably
						in about 1856, when the first St. Joseph Hotel was opened. The three-story brick now
						occupying part of the site of the hotel was erected by Joseph G. Bartlett in 1865, T.
						Wilke Defrees and Elias V. Clark, contractors.</p>

					<head rend="center">TRAVELER'S REST</head>
					<p>In 1837, Benjamin Wall began tavern-keeping on the southeast corner of Michigan and
						Jefferson streets. Upon the great swinging sign, in conspicuous letters, was the
						alluring scroll, "Traveler's Rest". The license was issued at the November term. Mr.
						Bugbee was a guest at the opening spread. Mr. Wall kept the place a number of years. The
						writer well remembers the guide-board on the tall sign post that with its index finger so
						long pointed the wayfarer to the south, advertising him that it was "65 miles to
						Logansport".</p>
					<p>The property was purchased by Mr. Wall of the writer's father, and, it is believed, did
						not prove satisfactory as a hotel venture. The building was removed by Alex. Staples to
						1221 Laurel street, where it may still be seen.</p>
				</div2>

					<head rend="center">RAILROAD EXCHANGE</head>
					<p>This is the building that, with a number of modifications and under various
						appellations, is still standing on the southwest corner of Michigan and Water streets,
						the only one of the pioneer hotel structures in South Bend that still occupies its
						original site. The lot is number one of the old plat. It was first sold to Levi F.
						Arnold, who was a member of the Brookfield surveying party in 1829, and who was one of
						the first justices of the peace of St. Joseph county. He is marked on Colonel Taylor's
						books as such purchaser, but appears to have been given no deed for the property. August
						11, 1834, the fee simple passed from Samuel Hanna to John Rush, "Black John", as he was
						familiarly called, to distinguish him from another John Rush to whom he was distantly
						related. Mr. Rush, most likely, proceeded at once to erect a building upon his purchase,
						as may be inferred from the following entry in the minutes of the board of trustees of
						the town corporation, at the meeting of December 29, 1835: "It is ordered that John Rush
						be permitted to occupy ten feet in front of his building on Michigan and Water streets
						for three months with lumber and building materials." This record is signed "H. Chapin,
						Prest." It appears from this wording that the building was already erected at that date.
						The place was first occupied as a general store by Mr. Rush in co-partnership with Dr.
						John A. Hendricks, under the firm name of Hendricks and Rush. It is not probable that
						the building as at first put up was more than a story and a half or two stories in
						height, for it appears to have been designed only for a store room. In May, 1837,
						Hendricks and Rush removed their store to the new square brick house that stood on the
						east side of Michigan street, just in front of the present Hill Brothers grist mill. The
						building vacated by them was fitted up for a tavern and perhaps now received its
						christening as the Railroad Exchange. Benjamin R. Hall was the first landlord, taking
						out his license in Septemder, 1837. Mr. Hall, later, kept "Our House" at Mt. Pleasant,
						on the Michigan road, in German township. This, as remarked elsewhere in these sketches,
						was a boom period for South Bend. The bridge across the St. Joseph, which was located
						exactly east of the first alley north of Navarre street, was opened for travel; the
						Kankakee race was about completed, it was thought, and the three mills to be thus set in
						operation were one of the happy dreams of the village; the hydraulic canal on the east
						side of the river was also in process of construction, giving employment to many
						laborers; the boats, for the most part, landed and discharged their cargoes at the
						Chapin warehouse directly opposite the Railroad Exchange; land speculation was running
						rampant; in a word, the outlook for South Bend was remarkably promising, especially for
						the north part. Other hotels were springing up in the village, and the capacity of the
						Exchange must be enlarged to meet the demands <pb id="VAC1111-013" n="12"/> of the hour.
						So under date May 21, 1838, we find Mr. Rush again granted permission to occupy 30 feet
						in front of Lot 1, for forty days, "for building purposes". This is the time, probably,
						when the structure received another story, had the wing annexed, and was adorned with
						the rows of front piazzas. Barnes and Russ of the Eagle Hotel did the work. Just why Mr.
						Russ should have taken out this permit is not clear, however, for on January 8 of the
						same year, the title to the property was conveyed to Alexis Coquillard with John T.
						Smith having a fractional interest, and these gentlemen were now the proprietors of the
						hotel.</p>
					<p>On March 3, 1838, the place was the scene of a grand dinner and jollification over the
						news that the twelfth branch of the State Bank of Indiana was to be located in South
						Bend. This was considered as of immense importance to the town and especially as a
						signal triumph over Michigan City, which had been working might and main to secure the
						same prize. Speeches were made, many toasts were given, and full many a purple bumper
						trembled at willing lips. One of the toasts, which passed as especially witty, ran about
						as follows: "Dot goose dot quack in de Michigan City (hard) Times, white folks cuss 'im
						an quit 'im. But bless 'im if I ketch 'im down this way, I pluck ebery tail fedder out
						of de wing." This Michigan City Times was a newspaper that most likely had been laboring
						hard to get the bank established in that village, and this sally was aimed as a terrific
						stunner for this now under dog. If I remember aright, Mr. Bugbee informed me that he was
						present as a participant on that occasion although we may be sure he drew not his
						inspiration from the purple cup.</p>
					<p>John Hooper was married at this hotel to Miss Phoebe Smith, on April 14, 1840, his wife
						being a sister of Mr. Coquillard's partner in the hotel; and Mr. Hooper at about this
						date succeeded these gentlemen in the charge of the hotel. Mr. Bugbee boarded with the
						last named landlord during the exciting "log-cabin and hard-cider" campaign of that
						year. Everywhere wagons were to be seen in procession, surmounted with log-cabins with
						coon skins decorating the outside, and a cider barrel lying hard by. An immense caravan
						of ox-teams thus headed drove the whole distance from South Bend to the Tippecanoe
						battleground, where it was met by similar caravans from other parts of the state, and
						where a grand jubilee was held in furtherance of the Whig cause. Everywhere the air was
						resonant with the refrain "Go it Tip and come it Tyler, Pull the trigger, bust the
						biler", ending with the chorus, "Tippecanoe and Tyler too."</p>
					<p>Well the Whigs won out at the election, but soon got more of "Tyler too" than was to
						their liking. As is well known, about the first thing Tyler did, after succeeding to the
						presidency, upon the death of General Harrison, was to vote the Whig pet measure to
						re-charter the United States Bank. And now it was the Democrats' turn to laugh, which
						they did metaphorically, with thundering cannon and a big whoop and hurrah blow-out at
						the Exchange in the first week of September, 1844. Mr. Hooper still presided <pb
							id="VAC1111-014" n="13"/> at that hostelry, and, himself an ardent Democrat, (or
						Locofoco) as the Whigs called them, he was, most assuredly, in hearty sympathy with his
						guests on this occasion.</p>
					<p>Mr. Hooper was succeeded by J. B. Cicot, who was the last to keep the place as a hotel
						for several years to come. I do not know when Mr. Cicot began or when he quit, but after
						closing out the business, he removed to Detroit and settled there. His brother, Edward
						V. Cicot, was for a time one of Mr. Coquillard's mercantile partners, and he was also
						one of the early directors of the South Bend branch of the State Bank.</p>
					<p>A serious reaction had now set in: in fact had set in some time before. The Kankakee
						canal proved to be too small and had to be enlarged at great cost, and even then it was
						a sad failure. Work on the East Race had been indefinitely suspended, indeed, had lasted
						but a single season. The bridge north of town had become unsafe, and had been torn down.
						Another bridge was thrown across the river at the foot of Washington street. Lewis M.
						Alverson had absconded with nearly $30,000 of Mr. Coquillard's money, which the latter
						was to have received from the government for removing the Indians west, and which he had
						entrusted Alverson to collect. Altogether, the north part of the town, which had so long
						depended largely upon Mr. Coquillard's bounty and enterprise, was now in a piteous
						plight. Mr. Rush collapsed financially about the time he sold the Exchange to Coquillard
						and Smith. He was never able to pay for much of the material with which the hotel had
						been reconstructed in 1838. Cassius Caldwell, of German township, lost to the value of
						about $100, on this account. A search of our land records will show that Mr. Rush was
						engaged widely in land speculation on his own account, as well as with Dr. Henricks and
						Coquillard. Henricks, as well as Rush, thus became swamped, while Coquillard also became
						seriously crippled. The Exchange passed from hand to hand rapidly, and for a season was
						abandoned to the bats and owls. During one summer when the hotel was thus forsaken, I
						went to school in the frame building which until recently stood on the corner now
						occupied as the Wyman residence grounds. This was the first time that I had heard
						grammar parsed, and the lingo, "Man is a common noun, masculine gender, third person,
						singular number, etc.", seemed very funny to me, and was as unintelligible to my
						perception as if it had been Sioux or Pawnee twaddle. We boys went swimming in the river
						about daily, and the dock of the Chapin warehouse was our favorite diving stand. We had
						to pass the forlorn Exchange in going back and forth; the railroad part of the name had
						now been dropped. There was a barn at the rear end, and all along Water street in that
						vicinity was a wilderness of the odorous gimson, among which a flock of sheep was busy
						in midday fighting flies. Finally Martin N. Gibbs, in 1855, got hold of the property. He
						was a carpenter by trade, and had erected some of the best buildings in this section
						whether in town or country. He changed <pb id="VAC1111-015" n="14"/> the name of the
						place to the "Gibbs House", and doubtless did more or less to make the building
						presentable. Still it lacked much of being a success in a business way. It was for a
						while turned into a school house where Elisha Sumption and Rev. A. Van Wormer and
						perhaps others taught a general school including the higher branches. On June 29, 1863,
						Mr. Gibbs sold to the late Dwight Deming, who fitted up the house for a residence; but
						upon the burning of the St. Joseph Hotel, he was prevailed upon to change the building
						back to a hostelry, which he did, calling it the Dwight House. Mr. Deming presided at
						this establishment till October 1, 1867, when Captain A. A. Allen, previously of the
						Bramble House, Lafayette, Indiana, became the host. "This house", as Mr. Allen's
						advertisement reads, "is first-class in all respects. The building and furniture are all
						new, and the rooms neat, airy and dry. Omnibuses at all the trains, for the hotel or any
						other part of the city. Stages leave this house daily for Niles, Berrien and St. Joseph,
						Michigan. Express coaches depart for Mishawaka, Notre Dame and St. Mary's several times
						each day. Good stabling."</p>
					<p>Captain Allen was succeeded, in 1873, by Jerry H. Knight and Captain Wm. C. Mills. The
						successive proprietors since have been John Freeman, Thomas Ragan, Wm. F. Mason and
						George H. Horn, Warren B. Titus, Colonel Wilson, Mason and Horn again, Howard Wagner and
						the present proprietor, Bird Bickford, who took possession Feb. 10, 1892, thus occupying
						the place for a considerably longer period than any of his predecessors. The name was
						changed from Dwight House to Sheridan House by Mr. Ragan, doubtless from the
						circumstance that the association of the names Ragan and Sheridan was more compatible in
						the view of the proprietor. The word "House" has since been dropped and that of "New"
						prefixed, so the name is now simply New Sheridan. To such terseness and simplicity is
						the present tendency; it is "The Oliver" and not "The Oliver House". The brick saloon
						part on the alley was erected by Mr. Ragan. He also enclosed the three piazzias, which
						fronted upon the north half of each of the three stories, the width of which may be seen
						in the break in the siding in the south wall. The extension on Water street out to the
						sidewalk line was done by John F. Kirby, when he became the owner, the brick veneering
						under Mr. Wagner's management. But with all its disguises and transformations, a close
						inspection can still determine the outlines of the building as it stood sixty-two years
						ago, when the citizens of the village, then with half its buildings of logs with stick
						chimneys and puncheon floors, here rollicked in gleeful banquet over securing a branch
						of the State Bank. Mr. Almond Bugbee was there, as I have said, and perhaps Cassius
						Caldwell. These alone remain to tell the story.</p>

				<div2 type="part">
					<head rend="center">FRANKLIN HOUSE</head>
					<p>The Franklin House stood on Lot 36, on the first alley corner east of Odd Fellows Hall.
						An oval signboard mounted upon a high post, and inscribed with the name of the house,
						invited such as were <pb id="VAC1111-016" n="15"/> hungered and athirst. It was the
						property of Henry and Margaret Diehl, both immigrants from Germany. The former was the
						maternal uncle of Charles Vinson, sr. of this city, and Margaret was the sister of John
						Bert (or Beard, as generally called,) who for many years kept a similar house in
						Mishawaka. He was the father of Henry Bert, the well-known meatmarket man, of this city.
						The first record we have of Henry Diehl in South Bend is that of a license to retail
						liquor, taken out at the September term, 1837. He then occupied a log house on the east
						side of Michigan street, somewhere between Washington and Colfax avenue. The same kind
						of license was issued to him a year after that date, and also at the May term, 1839. At
						the September term, 1840, he received his first license for tavern-keeping. On January
						15, 1838, he purchased the corner referred to, with 292 feet fronting on Washington
						street and extending back 118 feet along the alley. The building was a two-story frame,
						covering the Washington street frontage, and extending back seventy feet. His barn was
						on the rear end of Lot 33, on which Edward Fredrickson is now doing business. He could
						not pay for this lot and it reverted to the grantor, Samuel Leeper. Mr. Diehl was a
						baker by trade and the fame of his gingerbread soon became known far and wide. The
						writer remembers distinctly how tempting it looked, dark brown from the New Orleans
						molasses and the top crust deftly corrugated. A kind of root beer of his make also drew
						many customers. But his greatest attraction perhaps was his musical clock. Set in
						motion, a number of automatic musicians would file out in front and at the signal of the
						leader the instruments were properly adjusted and the melody began to pour forth. At the
						end to the right was a clown whose antics kept time to the cadence. Mr. Bert had the
						same kind of a clock at Mishawaka. The writer acknowledges his profound indebtedness to
						each of these instruments for sundry free entertainments. The Diehl clock was sold by
						Mr. Charles Vinson in the settlement of the estate to Edward Buysee, the jeweler, for
						$20., and Mr. Buysee in turn sold it to some Chicago party; so the mock orchestra may
						still be amusing the unsophisticated somewhere. Mr. Diehl died November 19, 1841, at the
						age of about 35 years, and the funeral services were held at the Presbyterian church. He
						is said to have been quite intelligent and comely of person. His wife survived him many
						years, and for some time continued the business. There were three children: Mrs.
						Catharine Schreck, Malinda, widow of J. George Vinson, and John H., all of whom are
						still living and residents of this city.</p>

					<head rend="center">THE FIRST ST. JOSEPH HOTEL.</head>
					<p>This old-time monument to the enterprise of South Bend stood upon the site of its
						present grand and massive successor, The Oliver. This was then a village with but about
						two thousand souls, but one railroad, not a paved or even a graded street, and its
						manufactories well nigh wholly confined to the West Race.</p>
					<pb id="VAC1111-017" n="16"/>
					<p>The ground was purchased of John Hammond, July 7, 1855, for $3,000, by the South Bend
						Hotel Company. The frontage on Main street extended across two lots, 132 feet, the same
						as that of The Oliver, and the frontage on Washington was 111 feet, 23½ feet less than
						that of the Oliver. No articles of incorporation can be found, so that the names of the
						stockholders cannot be definitely ascertained. Some hitch occurred in the working out of
						the project, the records showing that, on June 13, 1857, the property was sold on an
						execution to the late Judge Thomas S. Stanfield as commissioner in chancery, for
						$19,500. The same was quit-claimed by him January 1, 1858 for $38,168 to the following
						persons, with frontages on Washington proportional to the amount each paid: Elmer Rose,
						Matthew B. Hammond, David G. Rose, George F. Layton, Jesse Frame, Thomas Rockhill, John
						Hammond, William Miller, Hiram Doolittle, Christian Holler, John Casteter, William G.
						Whitman, and Elisha Egbert. All were residents of this county, and eight of them were
						farmers. It may be reasonably assumed that this list of names approximately tallies with
						that of the original South Bend Hotel company. Mrs. John Hammond of course joined in the
						conveyance; she is a resident of California. Mr. Whitman, familiarly known as "Bill
						Whit"&mdash;one of the stockholders, and County Treasurer John W. Zigler, Charles W.
						Martin, Thad. S. Taylor, and the Mesdames D. A. Veasey, John M. Veasey, E. S. Reynolds,
						J. F. Kirby, H. B. Hine, D. Dayton, and L. Humphrey. David K. Wall, now of Denver, was
						the first floor manager. The Hoosier Club, Dr. J. C. Sack, manager, and Lorenz Elbel,
						music director, gave popular entertainments here for several years, and some of our
						older citizens will remember in this connection "La Petite Ole Bull", the violin
						prodigy, and his father, J. Goodall, the dancing master.</p>
					<p>George B. Stedman, a cousin of the late L. T. Stedman, of this city, was the first
						clerk and came with Mr. Butts from Cleveland. He did not remain long in that station,
						but became proprietor of the Edwards Hotel, Plymouth, and while keeping this place was
						killed in some sort of a brawl by one --- Tibbetts, father of Charles A. Tibbetts, who
						was ripped open with a knife and immediately killed by Orange G. Stage of Walkerton, in
						the west room of the St. Joseph Hotel block, then a billiard hall, on May 19, 1870.</p>
					<p>Mr. Butts opened very auspiciously, but his patronage gradually waned. He was long a
						merchant tailor of South Bend and is supposed to be living in Chicago. All others
						connected with the enterprise are dead. Mr. Whitman has a son in Ann Arbor, who is a
						distinguished lawyer and politician, and another son in Detroit who is quite wealthy and
						occupies a high place in insurance circles. The investment, as these manipulations would
						indicate, proved to be far from satisfactory; and in March, 1858, the stockholders began
						one after another to dispose of their interests, till finally Mr. Ruckman and President
						Whitten became the sole owners, the bulk going to the former and much of this at about
						ten percent of the original cost.</p>
					<pb id="VAC1111-018" n="17"/>
					<p>Elmer Rose superintended the erection. Robert and James Alexander were the head
						carpenters. One Williams, of New Jersey, was foreman of the mason work. Oliver, Little
						&amp; Co. made the castings. Arch Defrees helped on the carpenter work of several of the
						store rooms; though very few local mechanics were employed on the job. Financial
						embarrassment seems to have arisen at about the time of the completion of the work, for
						the records show that September 14, 1856, one Travis B. Day filed a lien against the
						property for $98, being a claim for 49 days' work at lathing and plastering. November
						4th., following, the Alexanders also filed a lien to secure payment for carpenter work
						to the amount of $1,500.</p>
					<p>The building was a four-story brick covering the entire ground&mdash;111x132 feet. On
						the lower floor there were eight rooms, four fronting on Main street, and four on
						Washington. The main entrance, 18 feet wide by 40 deep, was also on this floor, in the
						center of the south front. Near the north end, on Main Street, there was another
						entrance, chiefly for the use of the house. The first room from the north, 21x40 feet,
						was included in the lease and served for the kitchen and the pantries; next came the
						postoffice, then conducted by the late Ralph Staples; then the St. Joseph Valley Bank,
						alias "Waubeck Bank-De Soto", by Harry B. Hine &amp; Co., and lastly, the offices of the
						U. S. Express and the "Electro Telegraph" companies, Esq. Charles M. Heaton, both agent
						and operator. The 'Squire never learned to read the ticks from sound.</p>
					<p>The corner room fronted south and was leased to George F. Layton for a drug store.
						Adjoining, west, was Whitman's clothing and merchant tailoring house. Beyond the hotel
						entrance came the Farmer's or People's store, Hon. Mark Whinery, manager. It is
						uncertain as to whether the last room on this street was occupied. The rooms were not
						considered desirable, being too far from the business center. There were, in part,
						different occupants at the time of the great fire. Staples and Vanderhoof then had a
						grocery in the corner room and the First National Bank was in the room formerly occupied
						by the Waubeck bank.</p>
					<p>The hotel proper comprized all above the first floor, together with the north room
						below, as already stated. The parlor was in the southeast room, second floor. Next,
						north, came the dining hail, and then the pastry bakery and lumber room. The public hall
						or ball room was on the fourth floor, on the west side; and ran along the whole length
						of the building, north and south. A court in the center afforded light and ventilation
						for the inner rooms.</p>
					<p>The full text of the first hotel lease is recorded in Book A, Miscellaneous Records,
						County Recorder's office. It was made September 6, 1856, to William R. Butts, and is
						signed on the part of the company by John Hammond. Elmer Rose, Benjamin F. Price, and
						William Ruckman, directors. The term was for five years, and the rental $500 for the
						first year and $1,000 per annum, thereafter, all payable in equal quarterly
						installments. <pb id="VAC1111-019" n="18"/> A part of the barn at the rear of the hotel,
						the property of Elmer Rose and James A. Ireland, was embraced in the lease, there being
						so much travel by carriage at that day that such accommodations were an essential part
						of hotel-keeping. Mr. Butts came at the suggestion of H. B. Hine; was from the Weddell
						Hotel, Cleveland. He is said to have been a model landlord.</p>
					<p>As has been mentioned else where in these sketches, John Hammond was at about this time
						keeping the Washington House, which was directly across the street east from the new
						hotel. Mr. Hammond, having now become part owner of the latter, immediately upon its
						opening, closed the former. There were a number of guests in the old hotel, and these,
						to make a sort of pageant, marched in a body, double file, across the street, from their
						old quarters to the new. C. A. Kimball, the genial, ever sunny "Cale", of the First
						National bank, was a member of this procession. Day board was $2.50 to $3 per week. Mr.
						Hammond and wife (no children) continued to reside at the old stand.</p>
					<p>The hotel was formally dedicated on Wednesday evening, September 10, 1856, with a grand
						banquet and ball. Several of the printed programs are still extant-- one in the
						possession of Mrs. W. D. Martin and another treasured by Charles W. Martin. It is quite
						an elaborate engraving, of which the Tribune presented a half-tone copy in its special
						edition on the recent dedication of The Oliver. The honorary members outside of South
						Bend comprised representatives from Chicago, Toledo, Cleveland, Mishawaka, La Porte,
						Goshen, Adrian, White Pigeon, Fremont, Coldwater, Elkhart, Monroe, Carlisle Hill, Terre
						Coupee, Niles, Plymouth, Rochester, Sturgis, Constantine, and Michigan City. Dean and
						Leland's orchestra, of Chicago, furnished the music. The chef, the waiters, and the
						corkscrew artist for the occasion were also from that city. There were one hundred and
						twenty-six couples present. A rubber-cushioned false floor covered the entire hall for
						the benefit of the terpsichorean devotees. South Bend has not to this day seen a more
						sumptuous or elegant social affair; at least, so some who were present still maintain.
						The guests on that occasion who were then and still are residents of South Bend, are
						John Gallagher, Caleb A. Kimball, ex-mayor William Miller. The lease had to be cancelled
						and about April 1, 1858, Dr. Alanson B. Merritt became the lessee. The late Daniel
						Hatch, the well-known liveryman, was the first clerk and later one Thomas.</p>
					<p>The late Theodore Witherill was the only boarder at the hotel when Mr. Butts retired,
						and he remarked that he would not have been there, only that he was boarding out a debt.
						But business picked up rapidly under the new management, and at the end of about nine
						months there were 100 patrons instead of a lone one. The rooms on the third floor had
						not been furnished by the preceding occupant. This now became necessary and was done,
						and the patronage reached a fair paying basis. The doctor became financially involved
						because of some other unfortunate business ventures, <pb id="VAC1111-020" n="19"/> and
						his thoughtful helpmeet, in an endeavor to relieve the stress, for a while did about all
						the kitchen and dining room work with her own hands.</p>
					<p>Sylvanus G. Gaylord, just from the American Hotel, and Lot Day, jr. succeeded Dr.
						Merritt December 30, 1858, having at that date entered into a partnership for the term
						of three years for this purpose. In the following April, Mr. Day sold his interest to
						the late Dr. Jacob Hardman, when the proprietorship became Gaylord and Hardman. It is not
						known how long this management lasted, but ex sheriff Charles M. Tutt and Thomas B.
						Roberts were the next occupants. In 1860, when George Wyman, our dry-goods prince, came
						to South Bend to cast his fortune among us, William Ruckman was occupying about one-half
						of the east part of the building for hotel purposes and Whitten and Borden the west part
						for the same. No further change of occupants occurred until the great fire of Tuesday,
						April 25, 1865, an account of which appeared in The Register.</p>
					<p>The St. Joseph Hotel was a losing enterprise well-nigh from the start, and more in
						advance of the town at that day than is its magnificent successor, The Oliver, at
						present. The Oliver is two stories higher and has 23½ more feet of frontage on
						Washington street than The St. Joseph. Making a rough comparison of the floor area, the
						Oliver, exclusive of the section on the alley, is about as 20 is to 11, or somewhat less
						than double that of the St. Joseph, while the population of South Bend during the
						intervening period has increased at least fifteen fold.</p>
					<p>Of course the merry jokes went round at that day, as ever. One was that a certain
						boarder had gone out one night to call upon his best girl, and the hours flitting away
						all too swiftly, as usual in such cases, on returning he found the street entrances
						locked against him. Night clerks and watchmen had not become known to South Bend at that
						day. A high board fence at the rear shut off the hotel from the livery stable and its
						unsightly concomitants. He could scale this fence easily enough; had done so many times
						before. Inside was a ponderous sugar hogshead used for a swill receptacle. It had been
						standing on the other side of the gate but now some blundering scavenger had changed its
						place. It was filled nearly to the brim; but all unawares of this change, over bounded
						the hapless swain "kersplash" into the unsavory cask up to the chin. He had just that
						evening donned his spring suit for the first time, a natty fresh tailor-made gray. The
						next morning he appeared at the table; in his seedy, last-years castaway garments,
						exciting much surprise and evoking the humorous comments of his fellow boarders. The
						facts would out despite all efforts to suppress them. But the victim won out on the main
						issue; he got his girl, has her yet, is still a resident, and now has several to call
						him grandpa.</p>

					<head rend="center">THE SECOND ST. JOSEPH HOTEL.</head>
					<p>This is the quaint-looking three-story brick, with four dormer windows, now known as
						115-117 Colfax Avenue, and partly occupied by Schuler &amp; Klingel, the wholesale
						fruit, feed, and produce dealers.</p>
					<pb id="VAC1111-021" n="20"/>
					<p>It was built and owned by the late David Greenwalt, being planned expressly for a
						hotel. Mr. Greenwalt was from Lebanon, Pa. and had the peculiar Pennsylvania ideas of
						architecture. The brick on Water street directly north of this hotel presents another
						example of Mr. Greenwalt's architectural taste, as did the J. F. Studebaker residence,
						just east of Sunnyside, before it was remodelled.</p>
					<p>The hotel was opened September 10, 1868, by Chauncey Nichols, formerly of the Bond
						House, of Niles, as proprietor, and L. H. Packard as clerk. The next year Barber &amp;
						Slocum took the place and this management was succeeded by E. L. Abbott, in 1871; by
						Jerry H. Knight and Henry Galloway, in 1872; by Henry Galloway in 1873-4-5; and by John
						G. Greenwalt, in 1876, at the close of whose lease the St. Joseph Hotel, with its large
						imposing sign, ceased to exist. The building then stood untenanted till about 1880, when
						Marvin Campbell became the lessee, with an extensive stock of hardware. With Marvin's
						characteristic hustle the locality became a brisk and stirring center. Mr. Campbell sold
						his business in 1886 to Munroe &amp; Creviston. When this film, now Munroe &amp;
						Keltner, removed to 111 North Michigan street, James A. Schuler &amp; Philip Klingel,
						under the firm name of Schuler &amp; Klingel, began their present business in the east
						half of the building. If "Jimmy's" genial nature and ever sunny smile count for what
						they ought, the haunts thereabouts will be radiant and jolly-wise for many a day. Jimmy
						sometimes drives the police patrol wagon, just for a little outing, you know, when his
						graceful and stately bearing becomes the cynosure of all eyes that may be so fortunate
						as to be along this line of the run.</p>

					<head rend="center">THE NATIONAL HOTEL</head>
					<p>In 1852, the late President Whitten, father of ex-city Engineer William M. Whitten,
						purchased of the late Evan C. Chalfant, of Clay township, 54 feet of the west end of
						lots 240 and 239, this being part of of the site of The Oliver block. He also purchased
						the next lot north and the one now occupied by Louis Nickel, Jr. &amp; Co. There was a
						one-story frame on Washington next to the alley. Mr. Whitten put another story on this
						for his family residence and alongside of it he erected a two-story wagon shop. Just
						east of this building he had a blacksmith shop. William Conrad, later, became interested
						with Mr. Whitten in both ownership of the property and the business, the firm being
						Whitten &amp; Conrad. The former was a blacksmith and the latter a wagonsmith. Mr.
						Conrad, later, became a resident of Warsaw, where he still resides. He is a staunch
						Democrat; is always seen at Democratic district gatherings and has served as a member of
						the state central committee.</p>
					<p>In about 1857, Mr. Whitten removed his shop to the rear end of the lot just across the
						alley east of the present post-office and converted his two buildings adjoining the St.
						Joseph Hotel into one and added at the rear a one-story part 30 x 40 feet. About the
						first of December, 1859, John A. Derbin leased this property and went to keeping tavern,
						calling the place The Derbin Hotel. County Assessor Thomas J. Slick clerked there about
						three months, commencing in December of that year. Mr. Derbin <pb id="VAC1111-022"
							n="21"/> was an uncle of Yoppie Hogue, of the Hogue Photograph studio, Jefferson
						street.</p>
					<p>About June 1, 1861, Mr. Derbin was succeeded by M. M. Shultz, who changed the name to
						National Hotel. Mr. Shultz (father-in-law of J. Edward Skillman, of the Singer works)
						continued here until 1862, when Mr. Whitten and his son in-law, Harvey C. Borden, took
						possession and rented the west half of the St. Joseph Hotel of Elisha Egbert and Mary J.
						Higinbotham, connecting this with the frame by an arched way. The west room of the St.
						Joseph Hotel was used for the office. The name National Hotel was continued under the
						new arrangement. In February, 1865, about two months before the great fire, Lot Day, Jr.
						purchased Mr. Borden's interest. There were some deferred payments. The loss was total,
						with no insurance. There was not the scratch of a pen to witness the indebtednes, yet it
						was paid to the last cent, without a whimper or quibble. The Days, it may be added, were
						long a prominent family in and about South Bend. Captain Lot Day, the elder, settled
						here in 1832, carried on the tanning business in several places, one of his tanyards
						being on Michigan street just north of Navarre. He was also a brick manufacturer, and
						was the contractor in the erection of the first brick jail. He served as county
						commissioner, twice as sheriff, and once as state senator. At a celebration of the
						Fourth of July, 1844, young Lot, then about twenty-one, was acting as cannoneer. The
						cast-iron piece was placed on the bluff, about where the standpipe now lifts its lofty
						column. A charge prematurely exploded, driving the ramrod, with its rough swab end,
						through Lot's hands, tearing off the right hand entirely and the thumb off the other
						hand, besides terribly lacerating the remaining four fingers but these were saved. Lot
						walked from the scene of the accident to the old Eagle Hotel (southeast corner of
						Washington and Lafayette) then occupied by his sister, Mary Ann, wife of William Norton.
						Here a Dr. Brown and Dr. Merritt amputated the arm and dressed the other wounds, the
						former operating and doing a bungling job. This, I believe was prior to the use or
						knowledge of anesthetics in the practice of surgery. David Stover, ex-mayor Miller and
						Thomas Byerly witnessed the operation. Much sympathy was aroused for the unfortunate
						young man and liberal contributions were made by the citizens for his schooling, under
						the tutorship of Prof. C. M. Wright, who was long the leading educator in this
						section.</p>
					<p>In 1846, the two Lots, father and son, were candidates on the Democratic ticket, the
						one for the state senate and the other for sheriff. The county was decidedly Whig, and
						each had a strong competitor, but both were elected. Lot Jr. succeeded himself as
						sheriff by a largely increased majority, and at the close of his second term was elected
						county recorder. Later, he was a member of the first board of directors of the state
						prison North. Of splendid figure, pleasing address, and a genial nature, Lot Day Jr. was
						beloved by everybody that knew him, even by the schoolboy and the frowsy urchin playing
						"knuckles" on the sidewalk. The elder Lot was among the early overland emigrants to
						California, where he died. The younger Lot went too later; kept the National Hotel, at
						Sacramento, for awhile, and died in that state some ten or more years ago.</p>
					<pb id="VAC1111-023" n="22"/>
					<p>June 13, 1865, Mr. Whitten purchased of the late George Knoblock the Lafayette Hotel, a
						one-story frame on the southeast corner of Lafayette and South Streets. He enlarged the
						building by putting on another story and adding other improvements. In the following
						December the place was opened as the National Hotel, with Mr. Whitten and Thomas J.
						Slick, his son-in-law, proprietors. July 28, 1868, Sarah A. Matthews, widow of Daniel
						Matthews, deceased, and daughter of Mr. Whitten, purchased part of the property at
						$5,000, and Mr. Slick retired. The business was continued in the firm name of Whitten
						&amp; Matthews till 1874, when L. H. Packard took charge. In 1877, we find R.
						Wansborough thus acting. This is the year the building was partially destroyed by fire;
						but was soon rehabilitated, making it a three-story, as you see it today, when it was
						re-christened the St. James. Mrs. Matthews had now become the sole owner.</p>
					<p>We shall now have to run over the succeeding proprietorships hastily as detail would be
						tedious. L. H. Packard, 1879; Matthews &amp; Crawford, 1880; Mathias M. Faulknor,
						1881-2-3-4-5; Clem Crawford, 1885; Byron J. McElrath till May 18, 1888, when the
						irrepressible Louis Pfeiffer stepped upon the scene, purchasing the property,
						refurnishing the hotel, making certain improvements, and in general instilling new life
						and a thrifty air into the place. Louis seems to be there to stay.</p>

					<head rend="center">THE FIRST OLIVER HOUSE</head>
					<p>The history of this hotel was recently printed in ample detail, and therefore calls for
						little notice here. The story, in short, is that three-story business blocks and Good's
						Opera House were erected by various parties on the site of the first St. Joseph Hotel
						after its destruction by fire in 1865. December 24, 1878, the entire block was again
						destroyed by fire, and in rebuilding the owners decided to convert a part of the first
						floor and the greater part of the other stories into a hotel. Out of compliment to Mr.
						James Oliver, the new hostelry was christened the Oliver House, which was formally
						opened on the evening of July 14, 1879, with Jerry H. &amp; Godfrey E. Knight
						proprietors. The Knight brothers ran the place for nearly ten years and were followed
						successively by Jones &amp; Cox, J. S. Mc Farland, father-in-law of Melville E. Stone,
						founder of the Chicago News, W. B. Titus, Phelps &amp; Parsons, Parsons, Parsons and
						Faulknor, Faulknor &amp; Mc Elrath, Rice &amp; Faulknor, and S. H. Rice. Under the
						latter's management, the house was finally closed with a supper on the evening of April
						30, 1898, after a period of nearly nineteen years. Few tears followed its passing, for
						it betokened the beginning of the gorgeous up-to-date and splendidly equipped new hotel,
						The Oliver.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="part">
					<head rend="center">GRAND CENTRAL HOTEL</head>
					<p>On South Michigan street 114 116, built and owned by Daniel M. Shively. Henry C. Knill
						was the first proprietor, opening in 1875. M. L. Dennis succeeded Mr. Knill in 1882.
						Frank Knill, Thomas Ragan, Henry C. Needham, A. K. Price, George W. Reynolds, <pb
							id="VAC1111-024" n="23"/> S. H. Rice, Warner B. Titus, and Mrs. S. J. Junkin followed
						in order as the lessees. Under Mr. Reynold's regieme, the name was changed to Reynold's
						House; under Mr. Titus' to Titus House; and now it is the Columbia. It is the first
						house in South Bend to introduce the passenger elevator, having put in one of these in
						May 1879, and was the only hotel in the city with such convenience till the opening of
						the new Oliver.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="part">
					<head rend="center">EUROPEAN HOTEL</head>
					<p>Now the Y. M. C. A. hall, 121 124 South Main street. Erected by Dr. Robert Harris and
						Edward M. Irvin in 1880. Opened by L. H. Packard the following year. In 1883, Mrs. Anna
						R. Smith became the proprietress, and changed the name to Hotel Bristol, under whose
						management the establishment eked out a precarious existence for about two years, when
						it finally closed as a hotel.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="part">
					<head rend="center">GRAND VIEW HOTEL</head>
					<p>On the southeast corner of St. Joseph street and Vistula avenue. Built by Christopher
						Muessel in 1892-3. Opened August 11, 1893, by John Ober. Then came, in order, Byron L.
						Mc Elrath, Sept. 28, 1896; Godfrey E. Knight, March, 1897; Mrs. Ida Powell, June, 1898;
						Thos. M. Morrison, March, 1899, who changed the name to The Morrison. The building is a
						substantial and sightly four-story brick and the view from the location is one of the
						most picturesque in the city. It is the property of the heirs of the original projector,
						as above stated.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="part">
					<head rend="center">HOTEL JOHNSON</head>
					<p>Situated adjacent to the Chicago &amp; Grand Trunk passenger station on the north side.
						Built by Johnson &amp; May in 1895. Was badly damaged before its completion by the
						burning of John R. Shank's livery barn. Was purchased by Charles L. Goetz and the late
						Louis Benz and leased by them, June 1, 1896, to Alexander Curtis, who at once won a
						liberal patronage and has since maintained the stand as a favorite resort for the local
						and transient public. Mr. Curtis was by no means a novice in the hotel business, having,
						previously, long and acceptably filled that station at the Milburn House, Mishawaka. He
						also, by the way, belongs to one of Penn township's earliest pioneer families, being
						himself a native of that section, not of yesterday, either. He bears vivid recollections
						of the luxuries of the round-log cabin, the country schoolmaster's hickory sprout, and
						corn-hoeing barefoot among the nettles, as well as do some of the rest of us.</p>

				<div2 type="part">
					<head rend="center">OTHER HOUSES</head>
					<p>Under the heading of "hotels" the following houses are mentioned in the city
						directories, but were perhaps more in the nature of boarding houses than hotels. Emmet
						House, corner of Franklin and South streets, F. Sullivan, 1869-70-71-72, Kunstman House
						1871-2, 125 South Michigan street, Andrew <pb id="VAC1111-025" n="24"/> Kunstman, and
						later, Conrad Oltsch; and Union House, on the corner of Michigan and Center streets,
						Frank Bauer, jr., later Arnold &amp; Vahlert, and now John C. Wagner. In 1873-74 there
						was the Lafayette House, 77 Michigan street (old numbering) George Knoblock &amp; Son. In
						1876 the South Bend House was located at 76 Michigan street run by Frank Ambos. In 1889
						Hotel Royal was at 117 West Washington street, Mrs. Vanderhoof, proprietress. In 1892
						the Hotel Washington was operated at 538 South Scott street by M. Pfaffenbach.</p>
					<p>The Oliver of today needs no writing up. It speaks for itself, as the pride of South
						Bend, as unexcelled in the state or in the West, as the latest and highest ideal of
						hotel appointments, as an enduring monument to its public-spirited and free-handed
						founder, James Oliver. It may be added, however, that the patronage of the house has
						proved much more encouraging than was expected by the management.</p>
					<milestone unit="typography" rend="center" n="*****"/>
					<p>An item overlooked at the proper place might still be mentioned as fitly illustrative
						of the advantages incident to our free institutions where there are the proper elements
						of character to render these available. Two of the boys that were diningroom waiters
						at the St. Joseph Hotel in the early Sixties merit notice in this connection. Later, one
						became a leading attorney at our bar and served as city judge; the other is well
						remembered as a member of our city council and long the trustee and efficient employe of
						the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway as baggagemaster and ticket agent. I of
						course refer to the brothers- the late John and Cornelius Hagerty. Surely, <q
