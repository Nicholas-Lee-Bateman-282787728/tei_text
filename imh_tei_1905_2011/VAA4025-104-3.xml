                         craze of the 1890s. Large groups of cyclists were, after all, a common
                         sight at the end of the nineteenth century. 1896 was the height of the
                         &quot;bicycle boom,&quot; a period of almost ten years when
                         Americans of every age, class, sex, and race fell head-over-heels in love
                         with a novel form of transportation that promised health and happiness,

                         Harmond has observed, the success of the cycling craze was due in large
                         part to the &quot;paradoxical attraction of the bicycle - as an
                         instance of inventive progress and as a means of flight from the
                         consequences of such progress.&quot;<hi rend="i">3</hi> On a more basic
                         level, however, this success can be attributed to major improvements in
                         bicycle design in the late 1880s that resulted in a safer, more comfortable
                         form of transportation, one essentially no different from the bicycle we
                         ride today. Thanks to these improvements, millions of ordinary Americans
                         became cyclists in the 1890s. &quot;Everyone was supposed to ride a
                         bicycle and one was not what they called &apos;in the swim&apos;
                         unless you mastered the wheel,&quot; one contemporary later wrote.<hi

                         groups of cyclists was not unusual.</p>
                    <p>What was unusual was the fact that only a week before McKinley addressed the
                         crowd of <placeName>

                         by an even larger crowd of cyclists. On that occasion, at least 3,000

                         willing to resort in order to win the election. The events of 1896,
                         however, were part of a much larger story, for even though it was the
                         Republicans who finally won the support of the &quot;bicycle

                         support of cyclists. For their part, cyclists were far more than passive
                         participants in the political process. They were, in fact, masterful
                         politicians in their own right, and, as I will show, they turned a national
                         craze for an exciting new form of technology to their personal and
                         political advantage. Historians have already recognized the importance of
                         the bicycle in the women&apos;s rights movement of the late nineteenth
                              century.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> In this article, I demonstrate that, in
                         the same period, the bicycle also helped middle-class white males -

                         establishment and acquire power in doing so.</p>
                    <p>Before delving into the details of the relationship between these elections
                         and the bicycle boom, it is worth taking a moment to answer the question of
                         what exactly the bicycle bloc was and how it came into existence. Although
                         representatives of the bicycle industry often advertised the bicycle as an
                         appropriate vehicle for a forward-looking, egalitarian, democratic nation,
                         and stood to reap some very tangible rewards from the establishment of a
                         bicycle bloc, the actual creation of this bloc was the work of the League
                         of American Wheelmen. Founded in 1880, the LAW was a national organization
                         of cyclists whose members worked to promote a greater appreciation and
                         awareness of cycling, to encourage cycling-friendly legislation, to stand
                         behind cyclists who felt they had been mistreated by state and local
                         governments or other entities such as railroad corporations, and, above
                         all, to encourage the construction and maintenance of good roads. Its
                         membership grew steadily, numbering over 70,000 at the height of the
                         cycling craze, and although in 1896 more than half its members hailed from

                         country; moreover, its prominence on the national cycling scene meant that
                         it also had the power to influence the millions of American cyclists who
                         did not officially belong to the league. Even before cycling&apos;s
                         popularity took off in the 1890s, the LAW had urged cyclists to unite and
                         put pressure on politicians to meet their demands for better roads and fair
                         treatment. As early as 1881, the league&apos;s president called for
                         &quot;laying aside all differences of party politics&quot; in
                         cities where wheelmen had come into conflict with municipal governments, in
                         order that they might &quot;combine, and use their earnest organized
                         efforts to defeat and kill off politically any alderman, mayor, or other
                         official who should attempt to deny their just rights.&quot;<hi

                         politicians. Nourished by the bicycle boom, the seeds sown in the 1880s
                         finally began to flower in the 1890s, and, as had been predicted, the
                         American &quot;wheel rider&quot; suddenly found himself being
                         courted by ambitious office-seekers who saw what was to be gained by
                         catering to the bicycle bloc. With this new political power in mind, we
                         return to William McKinley&apos;s campaign in the final weeks leading
                         up to the election of 1896.</p>

                         to one of his aides. &quot;If I should go now it would be an
                         acknowledgement of weakness. Moreover, I might just as well put up a
                         trapeze on my front lawn and compete with some professional athlete as go

                         McKinley&apos;s best hopes, he and his party were weaker than they
                         believed as the 1896 campaign unfolded. Although the ongoing economic
                         crisis, coupled with Grover Cleveland&apos;s four years of uninspired
                         leadership, had seemed almost to guarantee an easy Republican victory in
                         the coming election, the sudden appearance of William Jennings Bryan in the
                         summer of 1896 changed everything. Bryan&apos;s famous &quot;Cross
                         of Gold&quot; speech, delivered at the Democratic National Convention
                         in St. Louis on July 7, touched off a firestorm that the Republicans barely
                         survived. &quot;You shall not press down upon the brow of labor this

                         the gold standard, which he and many Democrats believed gave middle- and
                         upper- class residents of the industrialized Northeast an unfair advantage

                         times. Although most experts considered bimetallism risky at best, the
                         genie was already out of the bottle: Bryan had dared to offer a way out to
                         the hundreds of thousands of people from whom the American dream was
                         slipping away. Farmers and laborers in the South, the West, and large parts
                         of the Midwest considered him a crusader, and before long one witness could
                         write: &quot;The people in that section are simply crazy upon the money

                         as a thinker was beside the point,&quot; one of McKinley&apos;s
                         biographers has written of Bryan. Although McKinley could offer material
                         comfort, his platform &quot;lacked the mystical vision of the American
                         dream. Bryan&apos;s platform had precisely that dream.&quot;<hi

                    <p>Bryan set about turning the nation&apos;s geography to his advantage. Up
                         to that time, politicians had generally traveled only when necessary,
                         largely because of the difficulty of reaching some parts of the
                         nineteenth-century American interior, but also because many Americans
                         considered campaigning to be beneath the dignity of a candidate for high
                         office, particularly that of president. Consequently, Americans tended to
                         vote for parties rather than individuals. Bryan, however, cast tradition to
                         the wind in 1896. He chartered a train and set off on an extensive tour
                         that took him to more than half the states and made it possible for him to
                         appeal directly to the American people, drawing on the force of his
                         character to win their hearts and minds. The Republicans cringed. Thanks to
                         Bryan, &quot;the number of people to be reached, educated and convinced
                         was much larger than in any National campaign in the history of the
                         country,&quot; one Republican leader recalled in 1906. &quot;[W]e

                         damage Bryan was causing from the back of his train, GOP leaders came up

                         Republicans&apos; strategy was to flood the country with Republican
                         literature. While Bryan was out riding the rails and making stump speeches,
                         Mark Hanna was overseeing the printing of millions of posters and pamphlets
                         booming McKinley and the Republican ticket. A bottomless till meant that
                         there was essentially no limit to the amount of this literature that could
                         be produced. Finally, Republican clubs were established to help rally
                         voters, organize political events, and distribute campaign literature. This
                         was a sound strategy in its own right, but party leaders soon realized that
                         at least one thing would bring all three prongs of their strategy together
                         - the bicycle.</p>
                    <p>Cyclists would be the perfect campaigners. First of all, there were thousands
                         of them and their numbers were growing, so much so that bicycle
                         manufacturers could hardly keep up with demand. And not only did cyclists
                         love to be part of a crowd, they also displayed an impressive ability to
                         draw a crowd of their own. In 1895, one Fourth of July bicycle derby in <placeName>

                         territory in less time than a man traveling on foot. Cyclists could also
                         travel far out into the country and reach small towns and farms that may
                         have had limited contact with more densely populated and politically
                         informed areas.</p>
                    <p>There were other ways in which the bicycle was a godsend. The bicycle
                         industry was one of the few that had actually <hi rend="i">grown</hi>
                         during the depression of 1893-96. Steel mills, rubber manufacturers,
                         mechanics, department store owners, and even tailors and shoemakers all
                         benefited from the cycling craze. The bicycle came to stand for honest
                         industry, and that was something people could be optimistic about.
                         Republicans could also tap into a well-developed bicycle advertising
                         infrastructure; just as advertisements had helped the bicycle industry to
                         prosper during the lean years of the mid-1890s, there was no reason to
                         believe they could not do the same for McKinley. Furthermore, the main
                         issues of the 1896 campaign - money standards and tariffs - were not easy
                         subjects to interest people in, even though, if rather inadequately, both
                         parties did manage to explain these subjects in terms the average American
                         could understand; on a similar note, the economic depression that had led
                         to the debate over the &quot;money question&quot; in the first
                         place was psychologically depressing. The bicycle might well add a touch of
                         lightheartedness to an otherwise serious campaign. Despite the importance
                         of pamphlets in the election of 1896, &quot;education alone,&quot;
                         as historian Michael McGerr has written, &quot;did not win the battle
                         for McKinley or lose it for Bryan.&quot;<hi rend="sup">17</hi>
                         Amusement, far from diverting attention from the issues at stake, helped to
                         lure people into the debate and thus complemented the GOP&apos;s
                         educational campaign. In short, bikes were both bait and hook.</p>

                         rug, a lamp, gloves, a rocking chair, $7.50 in cash, bicycle boots, a
                         bicycle cape, two hats, a dozen McKinley tumblers, and twenty shaves. One
                         thousand cyclists took part in the parade. Russell Harrison, son of
                         ex-President Benjamin Harrison and chairman of the Terre Haute Electric
                         Railway Company, had a searchlight placed on the balcony of the

                         illuminate the scene below. Many extravagantly decorated bicycles appeared
                         in the parade, including one covered with flowers. Others were more mindful

                         appeared everywhere. Even the smallest newspapers routinely carried bicycle
                         ads, and readers of big dailies such as the <hi rend="i">St. Louis

                         the era of the cycling boom. The bicycle industry knew how to sell its
                         product, and Hanna&apos;s realization that he could pirate this
                         advertising infrastructure to sell a political candidate like McKinley was
                         nothing less than a stroke of genius. Theodore Roosevelt said of Hanna that
                         &quot;he has advertised McKinley as if he were a patent
                         medicine!&quot; It would not have been amiss of Roosevelt to say

                         Bicycle manufacturers lost no time in getting in on this latest fad, and
                         all the major manufacturers handed them out. The Republicans, too, managed
                         to take advantage of both the button craze and the bicycle craze, producing
                         at least five political buttons that either advertised the National
                         Wheelmen&apos;s McKinley and Hobart Club or drew some sort of parallel
                         between bicycles and the political race. One shows a spry Governor McKinley
                         sporting bicycle stockings and a cycling cap as he rides a wheel toward the
                         White House. On another, we find McKinley and Hobart riding a tandem
                         bicycle down the road to the executive mansion. The caption: &quot;Gold
                         Didn&apos;t Get There July 7th (the date of Bryan&apos;s
                         nomination), But Watch Us Take It There Nov. 3rd.&quot; A pin showing
                         Hanna reveals even more explicitly the similarities between political and
                         corporate advertising. The wily chairman of the GOP is perched on a
                         handsome gold bicycle with cameos of McKinley and Hobart fitted into its
                         wheels. Cautious customers are reassured that the product is

                         Bicycle&quot; and &quot;A Sure Winner&quot; printed on it. On
                         closer inspection it becomes clear that &quot;A Sure Winner&quot;
                         refers not only to Orient bicycles but also to one of that year&apos;s
                         presidential candidates: the tag has a small window and a wheel inside of
                         it which, when rotated, will reveal either the name
                         &quot;McKinley&quot; or &quot;Bryan.&quot; It is up to the

                         agitation with the Wall Street money doctrine was what angered the crowd.
                         They got up and howled in chorus, making it impossible for Pleus to hear

                         carried a cartoon of a distressed secretary of the treasury, John G.

                         because of their staunch opposition to free-coinage. The cartoon shows

                    <p>The situation is perhaps best summed up by two campaign pins that have

                         and were it not for the fact that McKinley&apos;s face appears on one
                         and Bryan&apos;s on the other, the pins would be identical. These
                         remind us that no matter how many wheelmen supported McKinley in 1896, the
                         Democrats still believed that cyclists could be persuaded to cross party
                         lines. Indeed, only one <list type="footnotes">

                         one day his younger brother Preston returned from a one-hundred-mile
                         bicycle ride (a &quot;century&quot;) and commented that the
                         &quot;elderly&quot; Harrison would probably have found it too
                         difficult. &quot;His pitying condolence made me secretly mad. I held my
                         peace, but the next day I was out at an early hour, telling my wife I would
                         be away on business until evening. I had in mind an attempt at &apos;a

                         the football season, to Harlan&apos;s dismay, was coming to an end.
                         &quot;Great were the wheelmen and Harrison was their prophet. The
                         Cyclists&apos; Champion had the center-rush candidate backed off the

                         resurrected bicycle baggage bill. If passed, the law would force railroads
                         to carry bicycles free as luggage - something which cyclists in many other
                         states had been lobbying for for some time and which railroads had been
                         fighting against. A circular signed by several prominent wheelmen endorsing
                         Harrison was sent around in the first week of April in an attempt to secure
                         the votes of <placeName>

                         Harrison, a poorly-timed blunder on the part of the state legislature.
                         Republicans quickly issued a circular of their own, pointing out that
                         &quot;it would not be consistent ... for wheelmen as an organized body

                         with the wheelmen of his city. In the summer of 1897, Taggart was nearing
                         the end of his first term. Like Carter Harrison, Taggart was a sound-money
                         Democrat who had crossed party lines in 1896 and supported McKinley and the
                         gold standard. Taggart began making appointments to a revitalized city park
                         board shortly after his election. Early in 1897, the park commissioners
                         allocated more than half-a-million dollars for the acquisition of land
                         along the <geogName key="tgn_1131742" reg="White">White River</geogName>

                         administration, the city&apos;s paved streets grew from 26 to 43 miles,
                         brick streets from 15 to 25, and creosoted wood streets from 1.6 to more
                         than 15; the mileage of cement sidewalks increased fivefold. In all, more
                         than four million dollars were spent on public works during his six years

                         consumer&apos;s attention. At the same time, new technologies softened
                         the boundaries of local communities. &quot;The radio, the railroad, and
                         the automobile did more to weaken the experience of community than to
                         strengthen it.&quot; When once-distant places were suddenly only a few
                         hours&apos; drive away - when with a flick of the wrist one could tap
                         into the radio waves and hear what was going on halfway across the country
                         - Americans became more aware of a national community.<hi rend="sup"

                    <p>If these things were true of the automobile in the early decades of the
                         twentieth century, they were less true of the bicycle at the end of the
                         nineteenth. Although the national craze for cycling undoubtedly distracted
                         many Americans from important developments in politics and society - just
                         as the bicycle&apos;s critics argued that it distracted wives from
                         their domestic responsibilities, men from their duty to God and family,
                         society from more proper literary pursuits - it clearly also helped others
                         find their political voice. The real importance of the history of the
                         &quot;winged wheel&quot; in American politics lies in the fact
                         that, as the turn of the twentieth century approached, the bicycle still
                         represented the nineteenth-century world of close-knit communities, mass
                         spectacle, and educational politics, but also looked forward to the new
                         world that was to come: a world of nationally advertised politics in which
                         political parties adopted corporate advertising strategies. This duality
                         raises some interesting questions. First, assuming that technology played a
                         leading role in the decline of popular politics in the early 1900s, at what
                         point had enough gadgets and new opportunities for amusement appeared that
                         we can safely say that politics as entertainment had finally taken a back
                         seat to the &quot;enchantments of leisure and consumption&quot;?
                         The story of the bicycle in the 1890s suggests that these twin enchantments
                         do not necessarily oppose - and may even foster - intelligent political
                         involvement. Given that complexity, we might also ask if it was a
                         particular <hi rend="i">quality</hi>, rather than quantity, of technology -
                         such as the ability to attain higher speeds and travel greater distances on
                         one&apos;s own than ever before - that finally pushed society into new
                         territory? What happened as those speeds and distances gradually increased?
                         The bicycle, like the automobile a generation later, was a fashionable new
                         technology that offered almost unparalleled opportunities for entertainment
                         and <list type="footnotes">

                         an automobile, anyone could escape from the pressures of industrial society
                         into nature, even if just for a few hours. And yet the bicycle did not
                         necessarily diminish Americans&apos; sense of community, their sense of
                         their own political worth, or, more importantly, their overall interest in
                         politics, as the automobile allegedly has done. Was this because the speed
                         and comfort of bicycle travel never reached those of the automobile? Both
                         cyclists and motorists indulged in escapism, but because of the
                         bicycle&apos;s design and its demands on the human body, it was hard
                         for cyclists to stay away from home for long periods of time; the shelter
                         provided by the automobile, on the other hand, meant that it could be, if
                         necessary, a home away from home. Although cyclists did occasionally travel
                         long distances, cycling remained primarily a community-based, social
                         activity, and only with the coming of the automobile did a significant
                         number of Americans finally attain the ability to journey to faraway places
                         easily and in relative privacy. Cyclists&apos; ties to the Good Roads
                         movement, moreover, are also evidence that local issues, rather than the
                         lure of distant horizons, were foremost in their minds.</p>
                    <p>The story of bicycling and politics in the 1890s offers a glimpse of a world
                         in which grassroots political involvement and intelligent activism were
                         combined with and even spurred on by fashionable consumption and a
                         technology of leisure. In light of the vast amount of new technology being
                         produced and marketed in the <placeName>

                         </placeName> today, as well as periodic declines in political involvement
                         on the part of voters in general and particularly of young voters, whether
                         that world can ever be created again is perhaps a question worth
                         asking.</p>

                         Black citizens suffered disproportional poverty and unemployment during the
                         worst years of the Depression. In the defense factories that sprang up to
                         meet World War II demands, they found new opportunities and hope. For the
                         first time, several major industries hired blacks for skilled jobs at good
                         wages, and federal regulations established anti-discrimination policies.
                         African Americans were to learn, however, that regulations did not
                         eliminate the color bar that confined them to the lowest paying and least
                         secure jobs. Despite some wartime gains, black citizens in the postwar
                         years once again found themselves in segregated workplaces,
                         disproportionately trapped on the bottom rungs of the economic ladder.</p>

                         economic pressures. Earlier studies have established the traditions,
                         championed by the Fort Wayne Chamber of Commerce in the 1920s and continued
                         for decades by white trade union locals, that limited black
                         workers&apos; access to industrial jobs. Researchers have described as
                         well a black population so weakened by complacency and financial depression

                         community.&quot; This study will build upon these earlier analyses by
                         looking more closely at patterns of discrimination and protest beginning in
                         the New Deal years and continuing until the national March on <placeName>

                         employment opportunities for black workers during World War II, and how
                         liberal paternalism contributed to the loss of these gains in the 1950s and
                         early 1960s. Finally, I will look at the increasingly activist stance of
                         the local NAACP through the mid-1950s and early 1960s. In combination with
                         new anti-discrimination legislation and the burgeoning civil rights
                         movement, local efforts broke through <placeName>

                         built a national civil rights movement. At the same time, a closer study
                         will uncover patterns that contributed to long-term demoralization and
                         economic stagnation for black citizens in urban centers such as <placeName>

                              city&apos;s black population. The immediate result was that in

                              city&apos;s rising problem of homelessness and hunger. In 1932,
                              using local funding provided by Federated Relief Agencies, the center
                              established an annex, separate from its 421 Douglass Avenue address,
                              at 503 East Breckenridge Street to provide shelter and meals for needy
                              African American men. The annex accommodated as many as forty men per
                              night; on the average the center provided seventy-five meals daily. By
                              1933 the Depression had created such a local emergency that even <placeName>

                              developing industries. As Iwan W. Morgan points out, industries that
                              sprang up in the 1920s and early 1930s were drawn to the city by the
                              Chamber of Commerce&apos;s promotional campaign boasting of its
                              old-stock (German, British, and Irish) workforce as being more
                              &quot;reliable, enterprising, and hardworking&quot; than
                              recent immigrants and African Americans. A survey of the black
                              workforce in 1937 reported that of the fifteen manufacturers that
                              established factories in <placeName>

                              Corporation&apos;s truck plant, which employed 125 African
                              Americans among its workforce of more than 4,000, stood out as the
                              single employer of black workers. Bass Foundry and the Pennsylvania
                              Railroad, older city employers, were the next largest employers with
                              45 and 15 black workers each. The majority of black men, if they were
                              fortunate enough to have a job, worked as &quot;family servants,
                              day workers, common laborers&quot; and at other miscellaneous low
                              paying, irregular work.<hi rend="sup">8</hi></p>
                         <p>Just as black men were excluded from manufacturing jobs, so too were
                              black women denied employment in the city&apos;s booming
                              electrical machinery, knit goods, and clothing factories, where
                              thousands of white women worked. Their race also excluded them from
                              clerical work, work as telephone or telegraph operators, and teaching,
                              nursing, and sales work - all jobs reserved for white women. More than
                              four-fifths of African American women, consistent with national
                              patterns, worked as servants, cooks, or cleaning ladies. A small
                              number found work as hairdressers, caterers, restaurant cooks, and
                              stenographers. U.S. Department of Labor statistics for 1930 show that
                              approximately 30 percent of <placeName>

                              similarities ended. On average, black women earned roughly one-third
                              of what white women were paid and less than one-fourth the pay of
                              white men. Most employed black women were in the 45-to-54 age group,
                              while white and foreign-born women most often were 25 and younger.

                         <p>To help African Americans find work in an ever-tightening job market,
                              Wheatley Center&apos;s Executive Secretary Edgar J. Unthank, Girls
                              Work Secretary Elma E. Alsup and Boy&apos;s Work Secretary John
                              Ridley built relationships with local employers and counseled
                              individual job seekers. Such initiatives had some success: a report
                              for 1936-1937 indicates that during that year more than 200 men and
                              women were placed in new jobs. Not recorded, but nonetheless implied,
                              is that blacks were still relegated to jobs at the bottom of the
                              economic ladder. What was different is that blacks were becoming more
                              assertive in competing with white workers for scarce employment. In
                              addition, Wheatley Center&apos;s efforts reflect a new emphasis on
                              relationships to other black organizations and national leaders; black
                              citizens began to develop what historian Kevin Gaines describes as a
                              &quot;collective consciousness and group solidarity.&quot;<hi

                         <p>In March 1933, Wheatley Center&apos;s training program for female
                              domestic servants represented a new blend of traditional racial uplift
                              with working-class empowerment. With economic hardships at crisis
                              levels, some whites now displaced African Americans in the
                              lowest-paying jobs that had always been linked to race. To give black
                              women a competitive edge, the center offered a six-week course at
                              Central High School as part of its industrial training program. Taught
                              by two college professors and a high school teacher, the classes gave
                              women training in home economics and psychology. Demand was high - 75

                              </placeName>. Echoing his earlier impassioned calls, President A.
                              Philip Randolph urged blacks to unite with white workers to combat the
                              unemployment that had &quot;taken on the picture of
                                   permanency.&quot;<hi rend="sup">16</hi></p>
                         <p>As the center&apos;s executive secretary, Unthank maintained a
                              delicate balance between numerous, not necessarily compatible
                              positions. More militant black leaders, including leaders of the NNC,
                              looked to members of the black community for leadership and emphasized
                              collective action and protest politics. Other leaders, following the
                              more traditional approach, worked with alliances of liberal white
                              reformers and depended on funding largely from white philanthropy.
                              They feared that confrontation and public protest would weaken their
                              already tenuous position. Like Bethune, black leaders also pursued
                              strategies that were &quot;subtle and manipulative.&quot; The
                              available records of this period suggest that Unthank sponsored
                              initiatives that he considered politically safe. In common with Urban

                         <p>Unthank&apos;s role on the Fort Wayne Interracial Commission
                              illustrates the tightrope that he often walked. Beginning in 1934, the
                              commission sponsored annual forums held on or around Abraham
                              Lincoln&apos;s birthday to promote understanding and goodwill
                              between the races. As representative of the Wheatley Center, Unthank
                              worked with the Fort Wayne Ministerial Association, the YMCA, and
                              dozens of elite black and white leaders to organize programs that
                              spread out over a week. Thousands of local citizens, black and white,
                              packed auditoriums to hear outstanding national religious and civil
                              rights leaders, interracial choruses, and addresses by local clergy.
                              The forums emphasized interracial cooperation and understanding,
                              however, not the tough issues of discrimination and segregation.<hi

                         <p>In 1936, for example, the forum highlighted Dr. Channing Tobias, senior

                              YMCA. His address, summarized on the first page of the <hi rend="i"

                              in April 1940 to 56,000 in June 1943. To meet emergency demands, many
                              local companies hired black men, as well as women of both races, for
                              the first time. Thousands of additional workers migrated to <placeName>

                              </placeName> in pursuit of work. Between 1940 and 1944, the
                              city&apos;s black population more than doubled, reaching its
                              wartime peak of about 6000, although population increases did not
                              necessarily correlate with employment. Critical labor shortages arose
                              in the last months of 1943, extending throughout 1944 and into 1945,
                              and placing unprecedented pressure on the federal employment service.
                              In October 1943 alone, 3,888 war jobs were posted at the
                              city&apos;s federally directed employment center. Unemployed women
                              were targeted by a house-to-house canvas conducted by women already
                              employed in local factories.<hi rend="sup">27</hi></p>
                         <p>Among the 30,000 new jobs created were a small but significant number of
                              positions newly available to black workers. The Defense Committee,
                              working with the Wheatley Center staff, placed 871 African Americans
                              in jobs previously closed to them. What remains hidden in reports of
                              defense industry growth, however, are the patterns of discrimination
                              that continued to block black workers not only from job training
                              programs and job advancement but even from bottom-level employment. As
                              reported in an Urban League study at the end of the decade, continuing
                              discrimination was common: &quot;It should be emphasized that even
                              during the war many of the local industries would not employ Negro
                              labor, defying even the insistence of the Fair Employment Practices

                              had recently received the government&apos;s prestigious E Award
                              for excellence in production. African Americans who were employed were
                              too often limited to custodial work. Such discrimination, Guy stated,
                              was &quot;hindering the war effort in that it [was] subversive of
                              civilian morale.&quot; Not surprisingly, his comments were

                              training programs for defense workers. Frequent reports in local
                              newspapers for 1942 and 1943 describe government programs at Central
                              High School, at the National Youth Administration Center at 1700 North
                              Calhoun Street, and at the Purdue University war training center. By
                              September 1943 companies were so desperate for welders that they
                              offered immediate on-the-job training. Still, black applicants were
                              not encouraged because of the expectation that employers would not
                              risk hiring them. The local United States Employment Service came

                              periods of full production. The company&apos;s local payroll
                              jumped from 6,200 employees in 1940 to peak production employment in
                              the summer of 1943 of 20,000. The percentage of women workers grew
                              from approximately 30, in late 1942, to 50 by the next summer. At the
                              Taylor Street Plant, where supercharger engines for military aircraft
                              were manufactured, women made up 58 percent of the 3000-member
                              workforce at peak production in 1944. While there are no statistics
                              showing the number of African Americans employed, evidence is clear
                              that General Electric hired blacks in significant numbers.<hi

                              personnel managers were reluctant to hire blacks. The first black
                              women were not hired until the summer of 1942, and then in begrudging
                              compliance to the government&apos;s order. I. H. Freeman, human
                              resources representative for General Electric, gave Wheatley Center a

                              Workers (UERMW) went on record in support of fair employment and
                              encouraged black employees to participate in union activities.

                              patterns of the day. The most obvious example was the Elex Club, a

                              Between 1943 and 1945, African American women met separately as the
                              Carver Club at the Wheatley Center. Just like their white co-workers,
                              Carver Club members supported soldiers, enjoyed holiday parties, and
                              went on group excursions. The Carver Club also shared in common with

                              percent, had dipped to less than 20 percent. Thousands of African
                              American women found new positions in defense industries. &quot;In

                              </placeName> correspondent reached a more guarded conclusion. As the
                              war wound down, 1800 blacks were regularly employed in local
                              factories. For the first time African Americans belonged to trade
                              unions; James Nash, a member of the UERMW, served on the Fort Wayne
                              Labor Council. Aside from a few trained and skilled workers, however,
                              blacks were still predominantly trapped in unskilled jobs.<hi

                         <p>A fuller assessment of black employment at the end of the war shows that
                              the city&apos;s black workers lacked the support of political
                              leaders, labor activists, and civil rights organizations. Deep racial
                              prejudices still blocked the vast majority of African Americans from
                              all but the most menial jobs in the city&apos;s industries and
                              other businesses. The small Wheatley Social Center staff, largely on
                              its own, had nevertheless built new alliances with some industrial
                              leaders. Hundreds of black workers, swept up in the unprecedented
                              demand for defense workers, had temporarily been hired into skilled
                              jobs with good paychecks; many of those in union positions had enjoyed
                              the support of national unions and those corporations with
                              non-discrimination policies. At the end of World War <list

                              Federal and state efforts during World War II had established
                              precedents that civil rights leaders continued to support. In 1945 the
                              Indiana General Assembly passed a FEPC bill, a bitter disappointment
                              because it lacked enforcement powers, but nevertheless a step forward.
                              It sent the message that job discrimination could be eliminated.</p>

                              </placeName> from 1940 to 1964, historian Thomas J. Sugrue argues that
                              the &quot;liberal consensus&quot; of the New Deal was eroded
                              by &quot;a newly assertive working-class whiteness.&quot;
                              While Sugrue pays particular attention to the bitter racial battles

                              following World War II. As FWUL leaders were to learn painfully, white
                              working-class union members proved to be the most formidable obstacles
                              to changes in the workplace. Other obstacles, less well-known, came
                              from white community leaders connected with the FWUL and from internal
                              struggles within labor and black leadership.<hi rend="sup">46</hi></p>

                              remained at the center of efforts to confront the intractable problems
                              of race. In 1949 the center, under the leadership of executive
                              secretary Robert E. Wilkerson, directed a researcher for the National
                              Urban League to undertake an in-depth study of its programs and of <placeName>

                              recommendations was that the center abandon its focus on recreation
                              and community organizations in order to strengthen its emphasis on
                              improving the economic status of local black citizens. Under its new
                              name, the Fort Wayne Urban League (FWUL), the center adopted the
                              mission of the National Urban League to serve as &quot;a social
                              planning agency primarily concerned with the general social welfare of
                              the Negro population and with race relations.&quot; Stressing that
                              the well-being of black citizens and the larger community depended on
                              economic prosperity, the FWUL recruited board members from the
                              city&apos;s business leaders. Furthermore, in its renewed efforts
                              to extend job opportunities, the FWUL attempted to follow
                              Kerns&apos;s recommendations to build more positive relations with
                              employers and rank-and-file union members.<hi rend="sup">47</hi></p>

                              discrimination, and financial hardships again became a way of life. In

                         <p>FWUL leaders were frustrated by the deep resistance they met in local
                              industries, but public expressions of discontent produced conflict
                              with their white power base. In the summer of 1949, for example,
                              Wilkerson candidly described employment barriers in the FWULs
                              newsletter <hi rend="i">Broadcast</hi>. Mincing no words, he stated
                              that black men and women, even in periods of full employment, were
                              never hired for better-paying jobs: &quot;Discrimination on
                              account of color, as we know, is the main reason for this satanic
                              condition.&quot; In a letter to Wilkerson dated August 30, 1949,
                              white realtor E. H. Kilbourne, president of the board of directors of
                              the FWUL, expressed his &quot;strong objections&quot; to the

                         <p>The FWUL persisted nonetheless. Its 1952-1953 survey of 70 local unions
                              verified Wilkerson&apos;s earlier remarks. The Fort Wayne
                              Federation of Labor, made up of 39 AFL unions, had no policy regarding
                              minority workers in its organizational manuals; 33 of the 39
                              affiliated unions had no black members. Six of the 15 CIO unions
                              affiliated with the Fort Wayne Industrial Union Council made little if
                              any effort to enforce the council&apos;s public non-discrimination
                              pledge. Even in unions with black members, such as the International
                              Brotherhood of Teamsters (AFL), black members were penalized because
                              of race. Unlike white members, they had to own their own vehicles or
                              be guaranteed a job as condition of membership. Among AFL unions that
                              represented some of <placeName>

                              </placeName> largest employers, including Dana and Essex Wire, black
                              workers represented less than one-half of one percent of the
                              workforce. At General Electric and International Harvester, companies
                              known to hire significant numbers of black workers, race was still a
                              limiting factor. Local 901 of the International Brotherhood of
                              Electrical Workers boasted a total membership of 11,000 but only 350
                              members were black. While the &quot;general relationship&quot;
                              between black and white workers was found to be
                              &quot;good,&quot; the union also was aware of the need to
                              initiate &quot;a more vigorous program&quot; in educating
                              workers against discrimination. At International Harvester, 300 black
                              workers - out of a total of 3,500 production workers - belonged to
                              Local 57 UAW. Despite anti-discrimination policies, racial tensions
                              had prompted &quot;several grievance cases&quot; on behalf of
                              black workers. Moreover, black workers expressed little confidence in
                              the union&apos;s regard for fair treatment.<hi rend="sup"

                         <p>The survey&apos;s other findings were equally disturbing. Racial

                              elsewhere in the country. Moreover, &quot;[s]ave in only a few
                              instances, most officials interviewed did not feel that discrimination
                              is both undemocratic and wrong,&quot; researchers were told. Among
                              CIO unions, whose members were generally more supportive of
                              non-discrimination practices, &quot;a gradual change in
                              attitude&quot; had occurred since World War II. For all but a few
                              local unions, educational programs to encourage positive race
                              relations were sorely needed.<hi rend="sup">51</hi></p>

                         <p>As union support for job desegregation faded in the first years after
                              World War II, a newly organized local chapter of the National
                              Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) joined
                              efforts to move the city forward in the struggle over racial
                              discrimination. In January 1946, a cross-section of 70 community
                              activists, black and white, signed a charter with much public support.
                              One of their first initiatives was to co-sponsor an ambitious
                              three-day conference in late November 1946 to address the hard issues
                              of employment, housing, and education. For what was no doubt the first
                              time in the city&apos;s history, a broad cross-section of local
                              organizations and civic leaders worked together to bring issues of
                              race before the public. Popular long-term Mayor Harry Baals addressed
                              the 300-plus in attendance. A panel discussion led by Jacob L. Risk,
                              director of the Fort Wayne Jewish Federation, drew particular
                              attention to the problems of employment. Conference highlights and
                              future plans were broadcast on local radio station WOWO. Such open and
                              frank discussions and broad support buoyed hope and gave the

                              turned to the fight in the Indiana General Assembly, led by state
                              NAACP president Ransom, to desegregate public schools. In another

                              Parkview Hospital). In the early 1950s, Fort Wayne Community Schools
                              hired its first three black teachers. Bell Telephone Company hired two
                              black customer service operators. In the mid-1950s, Lincoln National
                              Life Insurance Company, Northern Indiana Public Service Company, and
                              Fort Wayne Transit Company offered blacks employment for the first
                              time. Due to pressure from the local Unitarian Universalist
                              congregation, Wolf &amp; Dessaur Department Store hired their
                              first black sales clerk. Sears and Roebuck hired its first local black
                              saleslady in 1959. That same year marked the first time that black
                              maintenance workers were hired by Fort Wayne Community Schools.<hi

                         <p>Wilkerson became freer to speak without fear of reprisals following a
                              double victory in 1961 for civil rights legislation: the passage by
                              the Indiana General Assembly of the Indiana Fair Employment Practices
                              Act and the establishment of the Indiana Civil Rights Commission
                              (ICRC). The ICRC&apos;s original powers to investigate complaints
                              of racial discrimination relating to employment and public
                              accommodations were strengthened two years later by the Indiana Civil
                              Rights Act of 1963. In addition to the authority to hold public
                              hearings, the commission now had power to impose cease-and-desist
                              orders upon companies found to practice racial discrimination. In
                              February 1963, Wilkerson and Dr. Bernard Stuart, president of the Fort
                              Wayne NAACP, aired grievances at an ICRC hearing held at the Hotel Van
                              Orman. Wilkerson and Stuart criticized the Mayor&apos;s Commission
                              on Human Rights for inadequately reporting racial discrimination and
                              the city as a whole for housing and employment restrictions. Asked if
                              either the FWUL or the NAACP prosecuted known legal violations,
                              Wilkerson repeated the frustration he had expressed more than ten
                              years earlier in a FWUL newsletter: &quot;You can imagine what
                              would happen if we started prosecution against a company that was a
                              heavy contributor to the United Fund. He would naturally call the
                              United Fund and ask &apos;What is this guy Wilkerson trying to

                              companies. Labor unions continued to block blacks from apprenticeship
                              programs. Unemployment for blacks was at 12.4 percent, while the rate
                              for the city was only 3.9 percent. Average yearly income for blacks
                              was $2,400 less than that for whites. &quot;There must be a

                              with over 50 percent of white workers. The instability of the black

                              activists and by the failure of leaders to move from educational

                              interracialism that hid their city&apos;s deep structural racism.

                              Commission added to the city&apos;s reputation as being

                              the apparent racial peace as promoting racial justice. Black and white
                              leaders alike failed to understand how deeply embedded racism was in
                              their city&apos;s industrial culture. They followed patient,
                              polite methods, believing a better day was coming. Repeatedly, their
                              efforts were blocked by white workers and employers who held on to the
                              status quo and by their own reluctance to alienate their economic
                              base.</p>
                         <p>By 1963, black community leaders were again pushing back, and now the
                              country was beginning to move with them. The decades of patience and
                              accommodation, of polite protest with the expectations of voluntary
                              compliance, were over. Black citizens had built an urban community,
                              but their community was broken with unemployment and poverty. They
                              faced challenges equal to, if not greater than, those of the Great

                              ever, black citizens needed to believe in Martin Luther

                    <p>On August 13, 1862, twenty-five-year-old Samuel B. Seely enrolled as a
                         private in the 4th Indiana Cavalry, 77th Regiment, at <placeName>

                         </placeName>. He was mustered into the regiment in <placeName>
                              <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis"

                         </placeName> on August 20, and he remained in the war until its end, rising
                         in rank to sergeant and mustering out on June 29, 1865, at <placeName>

                    <p>The ten letters that follow were written by Seely to Elizabeth Hicks, a
                         sixteen-year-old neighbor back home, who, after the war, would become his
                         wife. They begin in September 1862 and continue to June 18, 1865, just days
                         before Seely&apos;s regiment was disbanded.</p>
                    <p>Seely&apos;s writing subtly illustrates his courtship of Hicks. For the
                         most part, his tone is humble and a bit bashful, although he sometimes
                         boasts or teases a little. He offers to send Hicks a miniature portrait of
                         a southern girl who &quot;almost&quot; fell in love with him;
                         realizing his mistake, <list type="footnotes">

                         <pb n="279" id="VAA4025-104-3-075"/>he soon apologizes for writing
                         &quot;so maney foolish things about other girls down in the wooden
                         country that I was a fraid you had got mad at me.&quot; The soldier
                         tries to be conscious of a young girl&apos;s sensibilities. He tells
                         stories of camp life - of how one friend received a &quot;Dear
                         John&quot; letter from the same girl who had urged him to enlist, and
                         of how he himself was teased by comrades over a gift that Elizabeth sent
                         him. Loneliness is another common subject - like so many other Civil War
                         soldiers, Seely sometimes begs for letters from home.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, Seely does not shrink from addressing the horrors of war. In
                         his June 15, 1863, letter - written from a hospital in <placeName>
                              <region type="state" key="tgn_7007825" reg="Tennessee"
                                   >Tennessee</region>
                         </placeName> - he expresses anger at the enemy for the death of a mutual
                         friend. He also confides to Hicks that he has been responsible for more
                         than a few Confederates &quot;biting the dust.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Seely appears to have remained hospitalized until sometime in November,
                         missing most of his regiment&apos;s campaign in eastern <placeName>
                              <region type="state" key="tgn_7007825" reg="Tennessee"
                                   >Tennessee</region>
                         </placeName>. Upon his return to duty in early 1864 he went
                         &quot;veteran,&quot; re-enlisting under a bargain offered by the
                         government for veteran soldiers. In return for reenlistment, he received a
                         thirty-day leave of absence, a cash bounty, and a stripe to sew on his
                         uniform sleeve. Over the next year-and-a-half, he fought in a series of
                         major battles and smaller skirmishes. He also spent time on courier duty,
                         sometimes a very dangerous assignment.</p>
                    <p>By the time Seely wrote his August 31, 1864, letter, the 4th Indiana Cavalry
                         was part of Sherman&apos;s Atlanta Campaign. From May 1 through
                         September 31, Federal forces drove southward from <placeName>
                              <settlement type="city" key="tgn_2022620" reg="Dalton"
                                   >Dalton</settlement>
                         </placeName>, <placeName>

                         </placeName>, all the way to the city. Seely&apos;s letter indicates
                         that he was on courier duty for General George Thomas, the Federal hero of
                         Chickamauga and the commander of the Army of the Cumberland. Meanwhile the
                         rest of the regiment, along with other cavalry, was engaged in a raid
                         around <placeName>
                              <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013331" reg="Atlanta"
                                   >Atlanta</settlement>
                         </placeName> to sever railroad supply lines to the beleaguered city. Seely
                         predicted, correctly, that the Union forces would soon have
                         Atlanta-Confederate forces holding the city surrendered on September 1, and
                         federal troops marched in on September 4. Seely&apos;s letter of
                         September 8 describes entering a largely abandoned <placeName>
                              <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013331" reg="Atlanta"
                                   >Atlanta</settlement>
                         </placeName>. He tries to relate to Hicks how it felt to enter the almost
                         silent city, after weeks of bombardment by shot and shell. &quot;Not a
                         house in the business part of the city,&quot; he writes, &quot;but
                         what has been hit and damaged more or less.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Seely&apos;s next letter documents the last major campaign of the war:
                         General James Harrison Wilson&apos;s great raid through the Deep South.
                         With three cavalry divisions, Wilson pushed through <placeName>

                         </placeName>, an important military manufacturing center. Wilson then moved
                         as far south as <placeName>

                         </placeName> and to civilian life. After being mustered out in late June
                         1865, Seely returned to <placeName>
                              <region type="county" key="tgn_2000544" reg="Greene">Greene

                         </placeName> and married Elizabeth Hicks in November of that same year. Two
                         daughters were born to the couple, Gara in 1867 and Winna in 1874.</p>
                    <p>Seely died of a heart attack in <placeName>

                         veteran&apos;s pension in 1880, his former company commander, Captain
                         Henry Billingsley, attested to Seely&apos;s various maladies during the
                         war: <quote rend="blockquote">In the latte part of Sept. 1826, [Seely] Was

                              when he did return he had lost his voice. He continued to suffer with

                    <p>Samuel Seely was an ordinary young Hoosier farmer who lived in a singular
                         period in American history and experienced extraordinary events. His
                         letters seldom reveal his political opinions, except for his extreme
                         dislike of the Southern sympathizers back home who &quot;have disgraced
                         themselves and can never shake it off.&quot; He does not write about
                         the leaders he served under, but instead about the common soldiers from his
                         company and regiment. In these letters, we get a taste of how an average
                         soldier, coping with loneliness and witnessing death and destruction around
                         him, doing his duty without criticism or rancor, presented his experiences
                         to the girl whom he hoped to rejoin.</p>

                                             Well Lib you musent think that I don&apos;t want to
                                             hear from you because I told you not to wright but I
                                             know you dont think so fore I know nothing gives me
                                             more pleasure than to hear from you But if I dont so I
                                             can talk they will not let me stay in the Regt. So if
                                             you did wright it would not likely get it but I will
                                             wright to you so how I get along The bugal has sounded

                                             you though I was sadisfide of the fearful news you
                                             would have to tell me. When I first heard of it I did
                                             not know how to consine my self to hiss loss but fore

                                             of the 16th of Oct which I reseived a few dayes ago;
                                             and read with plesure. It found me in about the same
                                             health as when I last wrote. When I wrote to you I

                                             know one minute whare he will be the next. My Captain
                                             told me when I left the regt that he would send paper
                                             with me from the division Surgeon so that I could be
                                             sent home. But them papers ware lost and that is the

                                             we repulsed them and sent them howling back. Phillips
                                             Regt was sed to of fought noble and he was kild right
                                             in front of one of our Batteries (that the Rebels tried
                                             to take) so he dide at his post like a true soldier.

                                             hardest of the fighting will end this falls Campaign.
                                             You wanted to know if my regiment was going veterans
                                             this fall. I have know talk of it as yet but expect it
                                             will get an invitation to go home time before long I
                                             have not full made up my mind yet whether to try it
                                             three years longer or not if I thought my service ware
                                             needed I would not hesitate a moment. But as it is I

                                             [a] very afectionate miss and very patrietet but did
                                             not think she would agree for him to go to the Armey
                                             for he sed he never wanted to go. So one time he sed to
                                             her that he had a notion of going to the Armey (just to
                                             hear what she would say) and she commenced to cry
                                             saying it was worse than death to part with him, but
                                             she sed go for her sake and fight the battle for his

                                             would be one for ever so with a heavy hart he left her.

                                             that does not clear them in my opinion for they have
                                             disgraced themselves and can never shake it off. But

                                             have had. This is quite a City (it had 30,000

                         more freely than anything else I have seen from 1832, and that would be

                         distinguished leaders - an advisory board of nearly two dozen who in turn
                         assembled as many general and consulting editors, as well as scores of
                         writers and illustrators who have profusely depicted the processes,

                         the low price of the volume.</p>
                    <p>The encyclopedia is organized into five major sections: &quot;Landscapes

                         grasp the depth and span of the volume; a detailed three-column index
                         extends over nearly the last 100 pages as an aid to more careful readers.
                         Unfortunately, the editors did not include a list of maps, illustrations,
                         tables, and photographs, and, although the helpful
                         &quot;Reader&apos;s Guide&quot; promises a &quot;credits
                         index at the end of the volume&quot; (p. xiii), this reviewer was

                         readers interested in geographical patterns or numerical quantities.</p>
                    <p>Readers interested in the literature and art of the Midwest will be
                         especially pleased with the work. Indeed, the Society and Culture section -
                         which includes subsections on language, folklore, literature, arts, sports
                         and recreation, and media and entertainment - comprises nearly four-tenths
                         of the entire volume. But history, political science, and geography are
                         also well represented. The treatments of rural, small town, and
                         metropolitan settlement patterns and lifestyles are rewarding, as are the
                         discussions of labor movements, politics, religious and cultural
                         institutions, and science and technology. By this reviewer&apos;s
                         count, there are about 200 longer overview essays and nearly 1500 shorter
                         topical entries in this wonderful volume. <hi rend="i">The American
                              Midwest: An Interpretive Encyclopedia</hi> deserves to be included in
                         the collections of public libraries, middle- and high school libraries, and
                         college and university libraries throughout the Midwest. The
                         book&apos;s low list price should make it an affordable addition to the
                         private libraries of interested residents of the region it depicts. All of
                         the many people who worked on this fine volume deserve a round of applause
                         from us Midwesterners. In short, this volume warrants an overall rating of
                         &quot;very highly recommended.&quot;</p>

                    <p>This book, the first official history of the U.S. District Court for the
                         Southern District of Indiana, was produced at the request of the historical
                         society of that court. The authors are, respectively, an academic who
                         specializes in <placeName>

                         </placeName> attorney who earlier served as a clerk for the judges of the
                         Southern District. Although not part of a series, the book appears at a
                         time when numerous works on midwestern state legal and judicial history are
                         being produced, including those comprising the Ohio University Press series
                         on Law, Society, and Politics in the Midwest. The book is easily accessible
                         to its intended audience of both attorneys and interested laypersons.</p>
                    <p>This volume is organized as a chronological account of the court&apos;s
                         history, beginning in <placeName>
                              <region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"
                                   >Indiana&apos;s</region>
                         </placeName> territorial period under the guidelines spelled out in the
                         Northwest Ordinance of 1787, then proceeding with the court&apos;s
                         institution under the U.S. Constitution, and its development, growth, and
                         changes during the almost two centuries of <placeName>
                              <region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region>
                         </placeName> statehood. The authors focus on several specific topics in
                         each period: administrative structure and operations, court personnel,
                         political influences, evolution of <placeName>
                              <region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region>
                         </placeName> law, and significant and interesting topics with which the
                         court has dealt. Their sources include court records, oral histories of
                         various judges, and a variety of secondary materials.</p>
                    <p>The authors present a clear picture of the growth and administrative
                         operation of the federal courts in <placeName>
                              <region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region>
                         </placeName>. They provide biographical material about judges and other
                         major staff people who have served the court, including political factors
                         which frequently influenced their selection. They explain how the operation
                         of the court has evolved and expanded, leading to the creation of the
                         separate northern and southern districts and to the development of altered
                         responsibilities in such areas as bankruptcy and the responsibilities of
                         magistrates.</p>
                    <p>Providing adequate treatment of the many varied topics which have occupied
                         the court&apos;s time over two hundred years was obviously a major
                         challenge for the authors. They touch on such wide-ranging issues as land
                         disputes, controversies raised by the Civil War, strikes and other labor
                         controversies, desegregation during the civil rights movement, political
                         corruption, prisoners&apos; rights, pornography, and the posting of the
                         Ten Commandments in public places, culminating with an account of a well-
                              <pb n="299" id="VAA4025-104-3-095"/>publicized controversy over
                         ownership of stolen international art. The list is not, nor can it be,
                         comprehensive. The authors have selected an interesting variety of topics,
                         without making claims that these are necessarily the most important issues
                         with which the court dealt at any given time.</p>
                    <p>This volume fills a need for a well-organized documentation of the federal
                         courts in <placeName>
                              <region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region>
                         </placeName>. It presents in a single volume a wealth of information about
                         the court&apos;s personnel, operation, and evolution during its first
                         two hundred years. One could wish, however, that the authors had done more
                         to place the court&apos;s work in the context of the larger history of
                         the federal court system, particularly in comparison to the evolution and
                         work of other federal courts in the Midwest.</p>

                    <p>Joseph M. White undertakes the ambitious task of presenting a sweeping

                         </placeName>. In the main, albeit not exclusively, the author draws on an
                         enormous and varied collection of secondary sources in his effort to
                         demonstrate how a small pioneer mission effort grew into a substantive
                         religious presence in the state. The book is divided into four parts: the
                         early initiatives of frontier Catholics, the establishment of the <placeName>
                              <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013933" reg="Fort Wayne">Fort

                         </placeName> bishopric, the administrative and cultural expansion of the
                         first half of the twentieth century, and the forces that propelled the
                         diocese through the second fifty years of the century and into the next.
                         Subjects range from the religious feelings of Potawatomi and Miami Indians
                         to the formation of the Catholic press; the outbursts of anti-Catholicism
                         in the state; the impact of the powerful University of Notre Dame at <placeName>
                              <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7014320" reg="South Bend">South

                         </placeName>; the modern challenges fueled by liturgical, financial, and
                         societal changes; and the national upheaval resulting from the
                         church&apos;s responses to sexual abuse by certain clergy members. With
                         such a plethora of topics - both interwoven and unrelated - an almost
                         overwhelming number of people, church agencies, and local parishes inhabit
                         each chapter.</p>
                    <p>White does an outstanding job of presenting this lengthy institutional <pb
                              n="300" id="VAA4025-104-3-096"/>record in a straightforward, easy-to-
                         follow style. The account will have special import for those acquainted

                         </placeName> sites mentioned. The material about enclaves of ethnic
                         Catholics - Poles, Croatians, Germans, Hungarians, Irish, Italians,
                         Lithuanians, Romanians, and Belgians - shows how, where, and why a rich
                         assortment of European groups, along with indigenous families, built <placeName>
                              <region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"

                         </placeName> Catholic population. Further, this work meshes with current
                         trends in Catholic history, for it avoids applauding only male clerics of
                         high position, embracing all laborers in the vineyard. For example, the
                         laity is rightly credited with the vibrancy of the Knights of Columbus,
                         Daughters of Isabella, National Council of Catholic Women, National Council
                         of Catholic Men, and Christian Family Movement. The indefatigability of
                         sisters in the founding and staffing of schools and hospitals is
                         prominently described. Accordingly, the book gives witness to the deeds of
                         those men and women - secular and religious - who committed themselves to
                         securing sacred and social services for the Catholic population of <placeName>
                              <region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region>
                         </placeName>, and it is certain to be an invaluable reference tool for
                         anyone interested in the religious or ethnic history of the state.</p>
                    <p>In addition, the author touches on high-profile, controversial subjects,
                         tracing a diocesan clash with a teachers&apos; union, the dismissal of
                         a popular basketball coach, and, in recent years, the financial and social
                         repercussions caused by sexual misconduct charges leveled against some
                         priests. Nonetheless, the book, which includes an afterword by sitting
                         bishop John M. D&apos;Arcy, is generally laudatory, as reflected in the
                         first part of the title: <hi rend="i">Worthy of the Gospel of Christ</hi>.
                         Thus, in its celebration, the text sidesteps the critical assessments that
                         would have added greater insights into some events or the actions of
                         certain key figures. This is disappointing, but the positive aspects of
                         White&apos;s meticulously researched and chronologically organized
                         monograph remain considerable. This book demonstrates the value of placing
                         religion at the center of any study that explores the ways in which
                         American communities formed and reformed, evolving over many years. White
                         gives the story of <placeName>

                         larger context of the growth of the country. This work is a significant
                         addition to regional, religious, and American history.</p>

                         state&apos;s agricultural development and rural life, particularly as
                         they relate to <placeName>

                         </placeName> beginnings. Good relevant sub-regional and community studies
                         have been done, including Stephen A. Vincent&apos;s <hi rend="i"
                              >Southern Seed, Northern Soil</hi> (1999) and Richard

                         Salstrom hopes that his broadly conceived history of <placeName>
                              <region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region>
                         </placeName> agriculture will close that gap; however, given the growth and
                         dynamism of the fields of rural and agricultural history and the important
                         connections being made to larger themes and narratives of
                         nineteenth-century history, the project looms as a tall (but not
                         impossible) order to fill.</p>
                    <p>With few hints to the reader as to its organization and thematic development,
                              <hi rend="i">From Pioneering to Persevering</hi> is, quite simply, a
                         very basic story about the considerations that influenced and characterized
                         nine- teenth-century family farming in <placeName>
                              <region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region>
                         </placeName> (and the Midwest, in general). The study ends in 1880 to avoid
                         dealing with the sweeping changes of the twentieth century. The single
                         expressed question that absorbs Salstrom is why family farming was so
                         economically viable in early <placeName>
                              <region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region>
                         </placeName>; his rather reductionist answer is that the world of family
                         farming disintegrated with &quot;the eventual invention of efficient
                         corn harvesters&quot; (p. 106).</p>
                    <p>Salstrom&apos;s chapters explore Native American agriculture before and
                         after European contact; why settlers came and where they settled; the
                         origins of the Corn Belt; pioneering in central, western, and northern <placeName>

                         </placeName>; agricultural pioneer Solon Robinson; competitive market
                         development; and a final assessment. Topical coverage is overwhelmingly
                         based upon secondary sources, most of which the author accepts
                         uncritically. Salstrom also tends to make some rather outlandish
                         statements, such as the assertion that &quot;Euro-Americans&apos;
                         land hunger certainly went back&quot; to the fall of the Roman Empire
                         (p. 35). The reader is hard-pressed to make that connection - and others in
                         this book, such as links between Midwest agriculture and Thomas
                         Jefferson&apos;s role in the Declaration of Independence, and also
                         between the region&apos;s farms and Europe&apos;s Dark Ages.</p>
                    <p>Where Salstrom succeeds is in outlining a narrative of the state&apos;s
                              <pb n="302" id="VAA4025-104-3-098"/>history that precedes
                         Euro-American settlement and that demonstrates the multiple influences
                         asserted by Native Americans, the French, and the British. Histories of
                         farming in the early Midwest need to address the complexities and
                         consequences surrounding native-white relations, including evolving federal
                         Indian and land policies, as they most certainly figured prominently in the
                         pioneering experiences. The model for this type of scholarship is R.

                    <p>Leland R. Johnson and Charles E. Parrish have succeeded in capturing the
                         story of designing and building the two-mile Louisville and Portland Canal
                         passage around the Falls of the <geogName key="tgn_7014265" reg="Ohio River">Ohio</geogName>. Examining the

                         nineteenth century, they present the positive side of the planned
                         obsolescence of these canal structures, built and maintained to ensure safe
                         travel over dangerous rapids and falls that have challenged Indian and

                         inland river craft.</p>
                    <p>The chapters trace the challenges and advancements of five engineering

                         </placeName> when both were vying to build a canal around the Falls. The
                         authors recount the successive structures on the site, from a series of
                         three locks completed in 1830 to aid in the safe navigation of inland river
                         commerce to the present-day twin locks, measuring 1,200 feet in length,
                         that accommodate towboats maneuvering massive, multiple barges through the
                         canal.</p>
                    <p>The authors also examine the ideas and leadership which led to the success of
                         the project. Topics include: the work of dedicated citizens; the transfer
                         of responsibility to the U.S. <pb n="303" id="VAA4025-104-3-099"
                         />government and to the Corps of Engineers; advancements in larger and more

                         concern of environmental changes caused by dam and lock improvements. The
                         authors demonstrate why periods of change and growth of inland river
                         commerce, occurring approximately every fifty years, necessitated the
                         enlargement of locks and navigation facilities at the

                         water beneath the panels caused them to rise and dam the river; closing the
                         valves allowed the panels to fall to the bottom&quot; (p. 158). Other
                         figures profiled in the canal&apos;s history include contractor Robert
                         English, whose 1841 patent for a floodgate based on a
                         &quot;trapdoor&quot; design resembled the operational design of the
                         Wabash &amp; Erie Canal Clear Creek Floodgate, removed in 1999 by the

                         </placeName>. Quintessentially urban people, Jewish immigrants and their
                         descendants tended to make their new American homes in large cities.
                         Accordingly, both scholarly and popular interpretations of the Jewish
                         experience are conditioned by its predominantly urban character. Until
                         recently, Jewish communities outside of large population centers attracted
                         little scholarly concern. Except for <placeName>

                         midsized towns that presented unique challenges to their Jewish citizenry.
                         Lee Shai Weisbach addressed these issues in his definitive <hi rend="i"
                              >Jewish Life in Small-Town <placeName>
                                   <country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">America</country>
                              </placeName></hi> (2005), published shortly before Shevitz completed
                         her manuscript. Shevitz&apos;s book thus plows through some freshly
                         cultivated territory. Still, the reader interested particularly in Jewish
                         life in any of these twenty-four <geogName key="tgn_7014265"
                              reg="Ohio River">Ohio River</geogName> communities will find
                         informative accounts of local history, lay and religious personalities,
                         economic strategies, religious observance, communal organizations,
                         anti-Semitism, and the social and economic linkages between the
                         communities.</p>
                    <p>Ten relatively brief chapters discuss the evolution and decline of Jewish
                         life along the <geogName key="tgn_7014265" reg="Ohio River">Ohio
                              River</geogName> from the earliest settlement of German and Alsatian
                         Jews in the nineteenth century to the present. The post-World War II
                         period, Shevitz contends, set in motion irreversible social and economic
                         changes to which Jews outside of metropolitan centers could not adapt in
                         the long term. Outmigration from town to city, declining Jewish birth
                         rates, a corresponding atrophy in synagogue membership in small and
                         midsized towns, the changing farm economy, and the inability of merchants
                         and commercial establishments <pb n="305" id="VAA4025-104-3-101"/>(the
                         economic core of Jewish life in the twenty-four towns) to compete with
                         national retail chains doomed the Jewish future in communities of modest
                         size.</p>
                    <p>Shevitz argues that her twenty-four communities constitute a distinct region
                         where the germination of middle-class American values and emergent
                         pluralism dovetailed with the values and aspirations of the first
                         German-Jewish settlers. Jewish newcomers in the region set their course on
                         fitting into their communities by participating in civic life and earning
                         the respect of their non-Jewish neighbors. Shevitz suggests that Judaism
                         was thus transformed into an American religion. Yet these and other
                         features are not unique to the region, as they were reproduced across the <placeName>
                              <country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">United States</country>
                         </placeName> wherever Jewish settlements emerged. German Jews, emancipated
                         from European ghetto life by political changes in the German states and
                         embracing the liberalizing trends of Reform Judaism, realized their goal of
                         incorporation into the social and economic life of the new country. Eastern
                         European Jews, arriving later in the nineteenth century, also managed,
                         though less smoothly, the adjustment process both within and beyond the
                         locales the author examines.</p>
                    <p>Commendably, Shevitz observes that anti-black violence was a much more
                         powerful force than anti-Semitism, even with the deepening vilification of
                         Jews in the 1920s and 1930s. She cites <placeName>

                         168). One could easily extend these examples. Of the 1893 dedication of

                         black men were lynched in <placeName>

                         </placeName>, and two more suffered the same fate in 1916. These atrocities
                         remind us that narratives of immigrant success, such as those Shevitz
                         effectively documents, co-existed with a grim history of anti-black
                         brutality and the gross inequities of a racial caste system that also
                         flourished in the Ohio Valley.</p>

                         the Canadian fur trade over several generations - perhaps 3,000 boatmen at
                         one time in the early nineteenth century - but the author&apos;s
                         limited focus prevents a much-needed analysis of the extensive cross-border
                         contacts among personnel and companies in the many fur wests of North
                         America. Nonetheless, Podruchny has performed a Herculean task in
                         extracting information about the highly mobile and mostly illiterate
                         voyageurs from a variety of documentary sources, and her study should
                         stimulate similar research for the fur trade in <placeName>

                         </placeName>, which is long overdue.</p>
                    <p>While careful scholarship promotes the discovery of previously ignored data,
                         it can also produce written syntheses that are so cautious as to be
                         inconclusive. Podruchny&apos;s repetitious narrative is replete with
                         tentative insertions of &quot;might&quot; and
                         &quot;possibly,&quot; and she often poses questions, rather than
                         providing definitive answers based on her accumulated data. For example,
                         she is frustratingly noncommittal about the voyageurs&apos; diet,
                         failing to resolve contradictory eyewitness evidence that they ate about
                         eight pounds of meat per day but usually had slim rations and sometimes
                         faced starvation.</p>
                    <p>Her main goal - to demystify and demythologize the voyageurs&apos;
                         &quot;world&quot; - is only partially accomplished, since those
                         indentured servants lived in <hi rend="i">several</hi> worlds, separated by
                         vast distances and changing over many decades. Although the voyageurs sang
                         their legendary songs not because they were
                         &quot;happy-go-lucky,&quot; but to <pb n="307"
                              id="VAA4025-104-3-103"/>stay awake, to make their physically taxing
                         work more endurable, and to pace the strokes of their canoe paddles, other
                         myths are not so easily dispelled. These frontier
                         &quot;proletarians&quot; rarely saved their earnings or showed much
                         interest in upward mobility; they played tricks on one another and deserved
                         their reputation as heavy drinkers; and their frequent sexual contacts with
                         Indian women only sometimes led to a kind of &quot;marriage,&quot;
                         and that for but a short time. The author succeeds in demonstrating the
                         voyageurs&apos; varied skills and physical endurance, but explanations
                         more convincing than masculinity theory are still needed if readers are to
                         understand the strong, strange fascination that lured them into the most
                         inaccessible regions of the continent with the harshest climate and
                         greatest dangers.</p>
                    <p>Readers who want an author to demonstrate authority in providing definitive
                         conclusions may find this book a frustrating journey - too much paddling

                    <p>For almost two centuries, American historians have striven to invest the War
                         of 1812 with enough significance to lift it out of the general obscurity in
                         which it languishes. In the process, they tend to interpret the conflict as
                         a consolidation of national independence, a follow-up to the War for
                         Independence, and an opportunity for Americans to prove that their new
                         republic was here to stay. Surely this is the most common theme in the
                         stories that Americans told themselves about the War of 1812. The
                         best-known tales relate the victories of Oliver Hazard Perry&apos;s
                         hastily constructed flotilla on <geogName key="tgn_7026039"
                              reg="Erie, Lake">Lake Erie</geogName> in September 1813 and Andrew

                         </placeName> in January 1815. This celebratory interpretation has always
                         been problematic, however. It requires turning the ineptitude of the
                         American government, as well as a string of military disasters that
                         climaxed in the burning of the indifferently defended <pb n="308"
                              id="VAA4025-104-3-104"/>national capital in the late summer of 1814,
                         into evidence of the enduring power of a democratic spirit that resides
                         more in the will of its people than in its political institutions.
                         Americans have worked hard to include the War of 1812 in a national
                         narrative about the progress of American freedom. Now comes the experienced
                         military historian Jon Latimer to suggest that in so doing scholars and the
                         general public have missed the conflict&apos;s true significance.</p>
                    <p>Latimer writes from an avowedly British perspective. If his Americans
                         sometimes seem like one-dimensional stock characters, well, turnabout is
                         fair play. Latimer brilliantly locates the War of 1812 within the
                         Napoleonic Wars of the era. Some historians have gestured at this global
                         perspective; Latimer makes the most of it. In <hi rend="i">1812: War with <placeName>
                                   <country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">America</country>
                              </placeName></hi>, the British are professionals confronting difficult
                         challenges created by the huge expanse of the North American theater and
                         the necessity of playing second fiddle to events on the other side of the
                              <geogName key="tgn_7014206" reg="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic</geogName>.
                         Latimer does not shy away from criticizing the decisions of British
                         officers on the ground in North America, including the dubious (and
                         ultimately fatal) choices of Major-General Sir Edward Pakenham in the
                         lead-up to the Battle of New Orleans. Nevertheless, 1812 offers an
                         important corrective to the usual American perspective on the enemies of
                         the republic. Even when Latimer is blatantly partisan - in describing the
                         burning of <placeName>
                              <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7015717" reg="District of Columbia"
                                   >Washington</settlement>
                         </placeName> as a just response to the destructive behavior of American
                         forces, he cannot resist saying that the immediate impact was to create
                         &quot;among the unfortunate inhabitants a feeling of shock and
                         awe&quot; (p. 318)- his judgments are smart and sound.</p>
                    <p>Latimer&apos;s greatest achievement lies in making a plausible case for
                         counting the War of 1812 as a victory for the British, who thwarted the
                         major initial American objective: the conquest of <placeName>
                              <country key="tgn_7005685" reg="Canada">Canada</country>
                         </placeName>. According to Latimer, the origins of the war lay in American
                         belligerence, while its most important outcome was the survival - not of
                         the <placeName>

                         </placeName> - but of <placeName>

                         </placeName>. Canadians find it easier to commemorate the war because they
                         can celebrate it as a spirited and ultimately successful fight against
                         American aggression.</p>
                    <p>Historiography aside, most readers will simply enjoy reading <hi rend="i"

                         particularly adept at breathing life into his characters and at organizing
                         the details of so many separate actions into a coherent whole. The result
                         is a lively book that is by far the most compelling account of the War of
                         1812 I have ever read.</p>

                    <p>Between April and August 1832, the Sauk warrior, Black Hawk, and 1,100 of his
                         supporters crossed the <geogName key="tgn_7022231" reg="Mississippi River"

                         legality of the treaties of 1804 and 1816 resulted in the deaths of
                         approximately 520 members of the &quot;British&quot; band of the
                         Sauk tribe, along with a significant number of Fox (Meskwaki), Kickapoo,
                         and Winnebago (Ho-Chunk) allies. In contrast, 77 white civilians,

                         the mutilation of the dead and wounded. And in the end, the war became the
                         last act of military resistance to federal Indian policy for the Algonquian
                         peoples of the Midwest, as both the Native allies and enemies of the Sauk
                         resigned themselves to the Indian Removal Act.</p>

                              <settlement type="city">Saukenuk</settlement>
                         </placeName> and the rich cornfields that they had cultivated since moving
                         there in 1767 seems like a fool&apos;s errand. Historian Patrick J.
                         Jung tells us that Black Hawk&apos;s decision to return was informed by
                         the Sauk&apos;s misunderstanding of the Treaty of Ghent, which they
                         believed defended their right to their homelands. Sauk diplomatic missions
                         to British outposts in <placeName>
                              <region type="province" key="tgn_7013154" reg="Ontario"

                         </placeName> led some to believe that the British might come to their aid.
                         Finally, Black Hawk followed the advice of a Winnebago Prophet named
                         Wabokieshiek, who suggested that the Sauk might be able to remain at <placeName>
                              <settlement type="city">Saukenuk</settlement>
                         </placeName> if they remained peaceful.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, the context of American settlement is largely missing from
                         Jung&apos;s analysis. For example, the proliferation of American lead
                         miners, the growing monopoly of the American Fur Company, and the presence
                         of squatters on their lands deeply antagonized the Sauk. Rather than
                         addressing these crucial elements of the story, Jung argues that
                         &quot;Black Hawk should have been more objective in his analysis of the
                         situation,&quot; and given up his claims in <placeName>
                              <region type="state" key="tgn_7007251" reg="Illinois"
                                   >Illinois</region>

                    <pb n="310" id="VAA4025-104-3-106"/>
                    <p>These and other conclusions assume that Black Hawk shared the same
                         epistemological vision of the world as the settlers who fought against him
                         and the historians who have written about him ever since. Yet one could
                         argue that the Black Hawk War, and the madness that its combatants
                         exhibited toward each other, illustrates the profound cultural differences
                         that increasingly shaped relations between American Indians and Europeans
                         on the lands once characterized as a cultural &quot;middle
                         ground.&quot;</p>
                    <p>In <hi rend="i">The Black Hawk War of 1832</hi>, both the Sauk and their
                         famous leader are victimized by bad advice, their own irrational
                         decision-making, and an &quot;anti-Americanism&quot; that, for
                         Jung, are analogous to the pan-Indian resistance movements led by Little
                         Turtle, Blue Jacket, and Tecumseh between the Northwest Indian War and the
                         War of 1812. Yet there are important limits to these connections, including
                         the fact that the primary aim of Black Hawk and his people was to return to
                         the village that had sustained them for generations. In contrast, both the
                         Northwest Indian War and the War of 1812 witnessed much larger numbers of
                         multi-ethnic combatants who fought to preserve a vast territory and an even
                         wider variety of cultures.</p>
                    <p>The intimate violence that characterized the Black Hawk War resulted in a
                         primary source record that is fraught with prejudices, misunderstandings,
                         and self-serving attempts to shape subsequent memories of the war. In this
                         book, Jung does not situate these sources in a varied enough context to
                         provide his readers with multiple perspectives on one of the more important
                         and troubling events in American history.</p>

                    <p>Using her 2001 University of Chicago dissertation as a base, Deborah A. Skok
                         brings together the methods and concerns of women&apos;s history,
                         Catholic history, urban history, immigration history, parish history, and
                         demography into a single meticulously researched and engaging work.</p>
                    <p>The acknowledgements recog- nize the giants of Progressive Era
                         women&apos;s history, especially Catholic women. Skok spent
                         considerable time researching at Catholic institutions, usually a sign that
                         the resources have been largely ignored by non-Catholic historians. Skok
                         correctly calls work <pb n="311" id="VAA4025-104-3-107"/>on Catholic
                         settlement houses &quot;largely invisible&quot; (p. 3). Elucidating
                         this otherwise marginalized history is clearly the purpose and value of
                         this book. Catholic settlement houses did not follow the &quot;classic
                         pattern&quot; by which such institutions evolved, the author notes, but
                         emerged from three different sources - individual charity, organizational
                         effort, or parish support. Skok organizes the book according to these
                         approaches rather than adopting a less useful chronological
                         consideration.</p>
                    <p>Skok highlights the differences between Protestant and/or non-sectarian
                         settlement endeavors and Catholic efforts. Both in their promotional
                         published fiction and in the reality of their work, Protestant rescuers
                         were people who descended below (in a gesture of noblesse oblige) to pull
                         people up; in the Catholic experience, both in fiction and fact, the
                         rescuers were part of the existing community. Common religious affiliation
                         brought the Catholic settlement workers closer to their charges than were
                         the upper-class Protestant women who performed the same services. Skok
                         emphasizes that these early Catholic social service efforts also provided
                         opportunities for women to increase their influence in the church and to
                         move beyond Catholic social and political circles.</p>
                    <p>Skok identifies Pope Leo XIII&apos;s 1891 encyclical on social issues as
                         a driving force behind laywomen&apos;s efforts to assist the Catholic
                         poor. Among Catholic Chicagoans, the settlement work that followed in the
                         wake of the document was about helping co-religionists - unlike Protestant
                         facilities, Catholic kindergartens were multi-ethnic and not segregated by
                         class. Protestant and secular reformers were moving away from nurseries,
                         but Catholics, more likely to be wage-laboring mothers, continued to open
                         daycares which often evolved into larger, more diverse entities with a
                         greater array of services. In their work, Catholics preferred the word
                         &quot;charity&quot; to &quot;reform&quot; due to the
                         negative connotations of the latter in the Catholic community, but that
                         changed as laywomen started to professionalize their social work.
                         Competition with Hull House and similar entities likely sped the
                         professionalization process.</p>
                    <p>Skok&apos;s work expands the two-dimensional view of competition between
                         Protestant missionaries and selfless Catholic nuns for the allegiance of
                         new immigrants. By focusing on Catholic laywomen, Skok reveals that their
                         competition for influence was often not Protestant women but Catholic
                         clergy, Catholic editors, Socialists, anti-clericals, Italian nationals,
                         city politicians, and padrones.</p>
                    <p>Skok also considers the methods Catholic women employed in their efforts to
                         mold behavior, especially that of young people. These efforts yielded great
                         fruit in providing employment opportunities and an otherwise unknown
                         personal autonomy and fulfillment for residents. <pb n="312"

                         integration of upwardly mobile Catholic women. The move of Catholics into
                         non-sectarian charities was often an indication of their general acceptance
                         into the macro-culture and a loss of their distinctive identity. It seems
                         that acculturation was the result, regardless of who piloted the
                         effort.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="i">Hull-House Maps and Papers</hi> was a groundbreaking text
                         published in 1895 by the residents of Hull House and edited by Jane Addams.
                         They described and measured group patterns associated with immigrants,
                         working conditions, specific laborers, labor unions, social settlements,
                         and art. Women&apos;s moral agency was central to their use of social
                         science to improve democracy and the lives of the disenfranchised. This
                         book is a towering statement by early sociologists, especially women, and
                         an outstanding example of the application of knowledge in the
                         community.</p>
                    <p>Hull House residents continued to map cultural, social, political, and <pb

                         neighborhood for the next forty years. As the neighborhood was increasingly
                         studied (e.g. by occupations, family size, housing, milk quality, food use,
                         and epidemiology), the findings were charted and hung on the walls of the
                         settlement house for the neighbors to see and discuss.</p>
                    <p>The maps included in this reprint revealed to the people of the neighborhood
                         the patterns of their lifestyles and the implications of these patterns for
                         community issues and interests. Repeatedly, Hull-House residents and
                         neighbors initiated campaigns for major social changes as a result of this
                         information: e.g., establishing the eight-hour day, the minimum wage, and
                         the elimination of child labor. They also worked in numerous social
                         movements on behalf of labor unions, women&apos;s suffrage, and arts
                         and crafts.</p>
                    <p>Rima Lunin Schultz writes a clear, concise, and powerful introduction to the
                         text. She documents the significance of the book over the intervening years
                         and shows why it continues to be important. The combination of the original
                         text and Schultz&apos;s introduction make the book accessible to the

                         ranging from high school civics and social science courses through graduate

                    <p>Louise W. Knight raises similar questions about citizenship and community in
                         her biography of Jane Addams. Knight documents Addams&apos;s life from
                         her birth in 1860 until the achievement of her &quot;half
                         life&quot; in either 1898 (p. 1) or 1899 (p. 409), what Knight calls
                         &quot;the years of her becoming&quot; (p. 1). <hi rend="i">Citizen:
                              Jane Addams and the Struggle for Democracy</hi> is premised on the
                         argument that Addams was raised in a Christian evangelical home with a
                         moral absolutist perspective: &quot;By 1898 she had rejected the
                         individualistic, absolutist, benevolent ethics of her father and her own
                         class in favor of what she perceived to be the working-class ethic of
                         cooperative justice, which she found less selfish and
                         self-righteous&quot; (p. 4).</p>
                    <p>Knight takes almost two hundred pages to arrive at the opening of Hull House.
                         Using archival information and extensive citations from Addams&apos;s
                         classic text <hi rend="i">Twenty Years at Hull-House</hi> (1910), Knight
                         labors to portray Addams and her family as rigid and emotionally cold. I
                         find neither her evidence nor argument compelling. Addams&apos;s early
                         life was filled with warm remembrances of the gentleness of her father, and
                         this affection and close relationship are lacking in Knight&apos;s
                         portrayal of them.</p>
                    <p>The vital Hull-House neighborhood and the whirl of activities surrounding
                         Addams become muted and <pb n="314" id="VAA4025-104-3-110"/>boring in this
                         text. Knight&apos;s book is tedious and labored, oriented to supporting
                         her view of Addams as having been neither a true democrat nor citizen until
                         1899.</p>
                    <p>One need only read <hi rend="i">Hull-House Maps and Papers</hi> to find
                         Knight&apos;s cursory analysis of the book (pp. 326- 31) lacking in
                         depth and insight. I recommend reading the lively and humane <hi rend="i"
                              >Twenty Years at Hull-House</hi> to begin to understand Addams, her
                         neighbors and friends, and the generous worldview that makes <placeName>

                    <p>This volume examines the history and roadside culture of the Dixie Highway,
                         one of the nation&apos;s first comprehensive road systems, designed in
                         the early twentieth century to provide better access from the Midwest to
                         the emerging tourist industries of the South. This handsome and
                         well-organized collection begins by exploring the local histories of the
                         road&apos;s planning and development in the period between the two
                         world wars. The subsequent ten chapters examine the roadside material
                         culture that emerged in the following decades.</p>

                         chapters in the collection address the idiosyncratic developments in

                         Carver&apos;s portrait of Harrison Mayes&apos;s religious roadside
                         advertisements astutely explore the tensions derived from rampant
                         commercialism and deep faith in the South. Karl Puljak develops a typology
                         of the roadside fireworks shack, and Kimberly D. Hinder examines the

                         tourism on the natural landscape by tracing the shift from nature as
                         wilderness cathedral to nature as recreation and diversion. The collection
                         concludes with Robert M. Craig&apos;s &quot;Pilgrimage Route to
                         Paradise: The Sacred and Profane Along the Dixie Highway,&quot; which
                         shows the endurance of the Streamlined Moderne aesthetic of the road in
                         today&apos;s commercial landscape.</p>
                    <p>This collection contributes to our understanding of early roadside
                         development and culture, while it calls on us to appreciate and preserve
                         these fading landscapes. The book grew out of the work of the Society for
                         Commercial Archeology, which is &quot;the oldest national organization
                         that encourages the study of the unique historic significance of
                         twentieth-century commercial landscape and culture.&quot; The
                         contributors, most of whom are historians of architecture or historic
                         preservation professionals, blend academic and professional concerns. While
                         there is little in the way of analysis of the segregation and hostility to
                         outsiders that occurred during this period in southern culture, this
                         collection offers a call to remember a roadside suffused with history and
                         character rather than homogeneity and monotony.</p>

                         Americans. Green argues that blacks in <placeName>

                         identity - changes that remain influential today. For Green, blacks, at
                         this time and in this city, engaged the challenges of modernity in an

                    <p>The substance of Green&apos;s analysis is found in five chapters. Chapter

                         organizer, Claude Barnett, founder of the Associated Negro Press. He points
                         out that, although the exposition failed to attract sufficient attendees or
                         revenue, the event offered evidence of Black <placeName>

                         became more decentralized after 1940. He explores this thesis through brief

                    <p>Though informative, Green&apos;s study has some notable flaws. His claim

                         unprecedented is untenable. Green&apos;s analysis is neither
                         comparative nor significantly evaluative of relevant prior phenomena, as
                         illustrated by the superficial chapter on music. Green ignores the
                         nationalizing role of entertainment circuits and the leverage maintained by
                         black unionized musicians during earlier periods when certain technological
                         innovations in sound reproduction were not available.</p>
                    <p>While Green writes with a sense of certainty, he erroneously asserts that <placeName>

                         Further, while the opening of the Parkway Ballroom in the 1940s no doubt
                         offered some competition to the Regal Theater, Green&apos;s assertion
                         that the structure rivaled the Regal, suggests that he does not understand
                         the differences in the size and social function of these two
                         institutions.</p>
                    <p>Other tenuous claims indicate that Green&apos;s book should be read with
                         caution. Throughout the book, Green references sociologist E. Franklin

                         example, Frazier&apos;s positive predictions regarding the black

                         Ordinarily, one would assume that a collection like this was composed of
                         previously published newspaper and magazine articles, but this does not
                         appear to be the case. Hay has been telling many of these stories for years

                         chronological, geographical, and topical terrain. Mary P. Ryan&apos;s
                         intriguing analysis ranges from the sixteenth century to the opening of the
                         twenty-first, exploring subjects as varied as the European conquest of the
                         Americas, the emergence of domesticity, slavery and race, citizenship,
                         work, social and sexual revolutions, and immigration. Her bibliography
                         alone, amounting to nearly fifty pages, is testament to the enormity of her
                         accomplishment.</p>

                         Border between Male and Female?&quot; indicate, Ryan (like many of the
                         scholars on whose work she draws) sees &quot;mysteries of sex&quot;
                         as central, not tangential, to American political, social, and economic
                         history.</p>
                    <p>The greatest strength of Ryan&apos;s book (and there are many) is its
                         ability to persuasively piece together the <hi rend="i">longue durée</hi>,
                         and hence to illuminate important continuities where other scholars
                         perceive dramatic change - and vice versa. In the process, Ryan boldly
                         transgresses traditional chronological boundaries. Her chapter on wage
                         work, &quot;How Do You Get from Home to Work to Equity?,&quot; is a
                         case in point. By tracing the history of women wage earners (a story
                         usually told in more truncated segments) from 1900 to 1960, Ryan challenges
                         interpretations that stress women&apos;s &quot;sudden&quot;
                         entrance into the paid labor force. &quot;New Women&quot; of all
                         classes flocked to the workforce in the 1910s and 1920s, seeing wage
                         earning not as drudgery, but as the key to social and economic
                         independence. Indeed, Ryan argues, employment had become so commonplace and
                         so desirable that these same women eagerly reentered the labor force when
                         opportunity or economic need arose. The typical World War II
                         &quot;Rosie&quot; was not the young novice wage earner of popular
                         imagination, but rather a middle-aged married woman. Raised in families in
                         which working wives and mothers were the norm, her daughters - hardly the
                         unhappy full-time housewives portrayed in Betty Friedan&apos;s <hi
                              rend="i">The Feminine Mystique</hi> (1963)- worked after marriage in
                         large numbers (married women accounted for 60 percent of all female wage
                         earners in 1960). As their ranks <pb n="320" id="VAA4025-104-3-116"
                         />expanded dramatically in the 1960s and 1970s, it was wage-earning women -
                         simultaneously exhilarated by their relative economic independence and
                         frustrated with unequal pay and limited career opportunities - who made
                         second-wave feminism a mass movement. Conversely, Ryan&apos;s analysis
                         of immigration, which compares turn-of-the-century Eastern and Southern
                         Europeans to a second, post-1965 wave of Asians and Latinos, emphasizes
                         change. Rejecting simplistic descriptions of immigrant families as rigidly
                         and unchangingly patriarchal, she shows that by the late twentieth century,
                         Korean, Vietnamese, Mexican, and Filipina wives and mothers were nearly as
                         likely to hold jobs as were their native-born counterparts.</p>
                    <p>A brief review can only hint at the richness of this book. <hi rend="i"
                              >Mysteries of Sex</hi> is best read as a series of loosely connected
                         essays that do not necessarily add up to a whole. Nor should they, for as
                         Ryan persuasively demonstrates, sex, gender, and sexuality operate on
                         multiple levels and in multiple contexts. In the end, I&apos;m not
                         quite sure that her title is apt. Perhaps because Ryan so convincingly
                         solves the puzzles she puts before the reader, little sense of mystery
                         remains. While the case is far from closed, <hi rend="i">Mysteries of
                              Sex</hi> is likely to remain the most compelling and definitive
                         interpretation of its subject for decades to come.</p>
