            <p>"I never had any education," says Linton Usher. He means not
                    much school-going, for, unconsciously to himself, he has acquired the greater
                    education through absorption of and absorption into the life of two great
                    American eras—the Civil War and the civilizing of the West.</p>
            <p>Not many months ago, in the state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName>, the author was handed a faded manuscript and to his surprise found
                    himself reading the sublime conclusion of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s second inaugural, written and signed by <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s own hand. Sometime during the days between his second
                    inauguration and his death, the President had written it as a courtesy to Mrs.
                    John P. Usher, wife of his Secretary of the Interior. It is now the property of
                    her son, Linton Usher, who was then a boy of twelve.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> To
                    know <placeName>

                    atmosphere of war-time <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, was the goodly beginning of this youth's education.</p>
            <p>Back of that, the traditions of high-minded families were the heritage with which
                    he began life. The Ushers were old New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> Puritans, dignitaries of state and church, probably derived from
                    Archbishop Usher to whom we owe the marginal chronology of our English Bible.
                    Linton's mother was the daughter of General Arthur Paterson and was
                    descended from the historic Patersons of <placeName>

                    </placeName> and from the Chambers family, the fighting Irish of Londonderry and
                    Vinegar Hill.</p>
            <p>Linton Joseph Usher was born at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, on December 9, 1852, where his father, John P. Usher, was

                    were familiar to Linton in his boyhood. For instance, "Uncle
                    Joe" Cannon was then a student of law in Mr. Usher's office,
                    and Linton remembers the wedding of the parents of Booth Tarkington. John P.
                    Usher presently became Attorney General of Indiana and conducted some of the
                    most important litigations of the day. The Ushers lived in a brick mansion on
                    the outskirts of the city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> and there gave almost continuous hospitality to the notables who
                    came on occasions of politics, business and litigation. It was the custom of the
                    time to keep a decanter of whiskey on the side-board from which the guests might
                    refresh themselves at will. Mrs. Usher placed beside it a similar decanter
                    containing tansy-tea. Says Linton Usher: "Sometimes the guests would
                    get some of that d—–stuff by mistake, and then, oh
                    h—–!" Mr. Usher's super-expletives,
                    especially such big words as are fully printed only in the Bible, are not
                    delivered as explosives, much less as imprecations. They simply glide along with
                    the even flow of his low and kindly voice and sound altogether winsome.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At this point, meet Linton Usher as he is today at eighty-six. In spite of his
                    many years, he still runs on his own power, rides his own horse, herds his own
                    cattle, shoots his own rifle, rolls his own cigarets, eats with his own natural
                    teeth, speaks his own picturesque language, and thinks with his own mind. Only a
                    man who relies on his own education can do all that. He is short and sturdy of
                    frame, light of foot, clear-eyed and clear-brained, with a round pleasant face,
                    graphic and easy of speech, alert and friendly in bearing, and built physically
                    and mentally for speed and endurance alike.</p>
            <p>In 1862, John P. Usher was called to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> to become First Assistant Secretary of the Interior. On January 8,
                    1863, he succeeded Caleb B. Smith as Secretary and entered <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s Cabinet. He became a wise counselor of the President and
                    an efficient administrator of his Department. Mr. Usher seems to have attempted
                    to impart to his boys his own interest in his Department and other public
                    affairs. In July of 1863, he brought Mrs. Usher and their three sons to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> where they resided on F Street between Sixth and <list type="footnotes">

                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi> The author has enjoyed a close personal
                            acquaintance with the old plainsman who is the subject of this sketch.
                            This was supplemented by several extended interviews, held for the
                            purpose of filling out the story and checking the information presented.
                            The prepared sketch was submitted to Mr. Usher and his family for
                            corrections and suggestions, following which it was given a final
                            revision before being offered for publication.</item>

                    Attorney Gneral Edward Bates, and Secretary Salmon P. Chase dwelt around the
                    corner. Soon after the Ushers arrived there occurred the marriage of
                    Chase's brilliant daughter Kate to Governor William Sprague of <placeName>
                        <country reg="riu">Rhode Island</country>
                    </placeName>. It was probably the most magnificient wedding that had ever taken
                    place in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Linton Usher saw it
                    boy-fashion—"peeking-in." But he seems to have been
                    equally intrigued by Sprague's bobtailed horse and an old
                    "crow-bait" which belonged to a negro living in the alley,
                    which was fed on the bedding of Sprague's gay steed. As to household
                    matters, the boy was impressed with his mother's continued serving of
                    coffee when chocolate as a beverage was coming into vogue. She also continued to
                    serve tansy-tea.</p>
            <p>The boy Linton in those days received excellent schooling. During most of their <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> residence, he and his brothers attended Bonzaga Academy, an
                    institution on Seventh Street maintained by the Jesuit order. For a briefer
                    period, Linton attended Morrisania Academy, an estimable school in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nju">New Jersey</region>
                    </placeName>. At Bonzaga, their intimates were the young sons of General
                    Ricketts, one of the substantial corps commanders of the federal army. No doubt
                    the Jesuits were good teachers, but Linton seems to be more impressed by the
                    education which he then picked up from the janitor in the
                    "jug" and the boys on the playground. The
                    "jug" was a dismal basement to which the boys were committed
                    for discipline, which to them was rather a lark. There presided the stout Irish
                    janitor with a too-thick stick, and he did not spoil the child. Yet the boys, it
                    seems, remembered him rather kindly. There the Ushers and the Ricketts boys were
                    wont to make effigies of Jeff Davis and pelt them with spit-balls, especially
                    when southern boys were with them in the "jug." There, and on
                    the playground the boys fought out the issues of the war. Linton was once booked
                    to win the war or lose it by a bout of fisticuffs, but the
                    "copperhead" champion defaulted. The possible explanation of
                    his default might explain something else. It is well-known that most residents
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in those days, apart from those employed by the government, were
                    southern and naturally pro-South, but most of them prudently held their tongues.
                    School-boys speak off the record, however, and the Usher and Ricketts lads found
                    their own loyalty almost unanimously antagonized <pb n="398" id="VAA4025-034-4-006"/> by scores of their schoolmates. Perhaps that
                    school-ground was one of the authentic "Mirrors of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>," and, if so, it probably reveals one of the reasons why
                    the threat of rebel raids on the capital was a haunting nightmare to the
                    administration.</p>
            <p>The writer's first question to Linton Usher (at least in point of
                    interest) was this: "What do you best remember about Abraham <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>?" He answered: "The time I saw Mr. Lincoln get
                    out of a barouche and get on a train. I thought he had the longest legs I ever
                    saw." That is true realism as no man could have said that except one
                    who had kept faith with his own boyhood. Then he added: "One time Mr.
                    Lincoln put his hand on my head and said `You're a fine boy and will
                    grow up to be a fine man.'" With this my old friend looked at
                    me whimsically, as though to say "That time the joke was on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>." Yet only a fine man could have told the story in that
                    way. Mr. Usher is never the hero of his own stories, nor does he embellish them.
                    He seems a little at a loss to account for his hearer's interest nor
                    can he be tempted into inventing a climax where there wasn't a climax
                    in the actual unfolding of events. Some of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s immortal jokes were heard from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s own lips by Linton's father, and hearing them
                    from Linton now makes them seem less like distance echoes and more like living
                    speech. For instance, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s incomparable word-picture of Stephens: "I never
                    saw a small nubbin wrapped up in so many shucks."</p>
            <p>In regard to Mrs. Lincoln, Linton Usher remembers shaking hands with her at a
                    White House reception, noticing that her little hand was so fat that she
                    couldn't pull her gloves much above her finger-tips. He recalls that he
                    disapproved of her affectations and doubted her loyalty to the Union. It roused
                    his spirit when asked whether he remembered <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> at any historic scene. Indeed he did. He remembered the President
                    as he stood on the balcony of a high window and reviewed the march of General
                    Ambrose E. Burnside's Ninth Corps on the way to battle. He only said
                    about that much and with no stress of voice, but his listeners heard the drum
                    beats, the tramping feet and huzzas. After a silence, he further said:
                    "And I heard <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> deliver his second Inaugural." Then for a while, there was
                    a silence again.</p>
            <p>As a boy Linton Usher talked and shook hands with Grant and Sherman. He remembers
                    also Sheridan, Hooker, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName>, <pb n="399" id="VAA4025-034-4-007"/> Stanton, and Sumner (whose
                    pretentious coach seems not to have pleased him). Neither did he like the looks
                    of Burn-side. Most of all he admired John A. Logan, and almost equally General
                    Winfield S. Hancock, who continued to be his friend in later years. He saw
                    Johnson's inauguration as vice-president. Several times he saw Congress
                    in session.</p>
            <p>There must have been something agreeable about those Usher lads for busy, great
                    men companioned them. Walt Whitman, who never flattered nor favored anyone whom
                    he didn't enjoy, was hilarious with these "kids" and
                    sent them books. Joseph A. Wright, when minister to Prussia, sent young Linton a
                    fine oil painting from Berlin which still hangs in his parlor. Caleb Lyon, art
                    connoisseur and esthete, seemed glad to take the lad to his hearthside and his
                    heart.</p>
            <p>Farragut, in the strenuous hours of preparing his fleet for Mobile, found time to
                    befriend him. And thereby hangs a charming tale of that great Admiral out of
                    uniform. Secretary Usher had taken Linton to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, where he remembers seeing "Ten Nights in a Bar
                    Room," but best of all remembers how Farragut took him over the
                    flag-ship <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hartford</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which was then fitting out for the attack on Mobile, and proposed
                    to take him along as a "powder-monkey." Returning from the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brooklyn</settlement>
                    </placeName> Navy Yard, the Ushers rode an eight-cent bus. An old Irish woman
                    with a basket of vegetables had handed up a dime to the driver and failing to
                    receive her change, began "roaring for it," as Mr. Usher says.
                    The Admiral, in unimposing civil costume, ordered his aide, who was magnificent
                    in full uniform, to go aloft and see that two cents and full justice were
                    rendered to the old woman. Of men long honored, it is good to learn that they
                    may be loved too. At another time Linton also visited the flagship of Admiral
                    Meade who showed him a barrel of <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> water which had
                    been twelve times around Cape Horn and still was fresh.</p>
            <p>It is possible that no one else now living has had so near a view of the seats of
                    the mighty in those days. His father was one of them, and one of the most
                    clear-sighted of them. So the son was enabled to see with his father's
                    eyes, and it may well be that his views are sometimes authentic insights. His
                    estimate of Gideon Welles as a common-place but trustworthy Naval Secretary, and
                    of Welles' assistant Gustavus Vasa Fox, as one of history's
                    pre-eminent "organizers of victory," is possibly sound, as is
                    his clear recognition alike of <pb n="400" id="VAA4025-034-4-008"/>
                    Chase's greatness and great defects, and of the social and political
                    cleverness of the brilliant daughter Kate, the tragic bride of Governor Sprague.
                    When Usher today asserts definitely that Grant, in his Eastern campaign, was
                    hindered from the start by the prejudices of the important eastern generals,
                    save <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hancock</settlement>
                    </placeName>; when he asserts that those who knew Frémont most
                    intimately gave least credit to Frémont's
                    greatness—then we can say, at least, that the boy made some
                    historical inquiries. Whenever Linton importuned his father concerning the
                    conspiracy that led to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s murder, Secretary Usher would reply that the
                    ramifications were so far-reaching that it was well that investigations had gone
                    no farther. At that point John P. Usher's lips were sealed. Is there
                    still some unsolved mystery involved?</p>
            <p>Another public event on which the Usher manuscripts give us a side-light is the
                    appointment of David Davis to the Supreme Court in 1862. It is nearly true to
                    say that Davis had made <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> President, as he was later to refuse in 1876 the opportunity to
                    make another president. His appointment to the Supreme Bench would seem to have
                    been <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s logical course and Secretary Usher had written to Davis
                    offering to urge his nomination. The Davis letter in reply is still in Linton
                    Usher's possession. Davis, who was equally great as a legislator and a
                    jurist, was no less great as a patriot and as a friend. His cordial appreciation
                    of Mr. Usher's confidence is evident, but he rejected definitely all
                    efforts in his own behalf. For many years, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> had been his dear friend and the old friendship must not now be
                    made an added load to the over-burdened President, nor must the claims of
                    personal frienship be permitted to complicate the President's judgment
                    of public duty. The clear script and clear language of this extraordinary letter
                    attest the clear conscience of the writer. To read this confidential letter to a
                    friend about a friend, should give pause to certain contemporary
                    historiographers who are making out that Davis at that time was busily
                    intriguing among the mutual friends of himself and the President to put pressure
                    on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> in behalf of this appointment. It is pleasing to know that a few
                    weeks later <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> appointed David Davis to the Supreme Court.</p>
            <p>Another event which lives in Linton's vivid memory is General
                    Early's raid toward <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1864. The Confederate <pb n="401" id="VAA4025-034-4-009"/>
                    leader almost arrived. In <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> excitement ran high and hot. All the men and many boys were under
                    arms. Linton Usher himself flourished an old musket which it is unlikely that he
                    or anybody else could have fired. Across the street from the Usher home was the
                    mansion of a notorious pro-southern family. That night every window from
                    basement to garret was blazing with light to give welcome to Early's
                    troopers. It was believed by some that Conferedate officers had wormed their way
                    into the city and were in that house that night. Mr. Usher makes the shrewd
                    surmise that Early could have brought his army in, but was smart enough to know
                    that he could not have made his way out again.</p>
            <p>On the fourteenth of April, 1865—note that date—Secretary
                    Usher's family moved from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> to resume their residence in Indiana. The Secretary had gone with
                    them as far as Relay Junction, half-way to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                    </placeName>. There he learned that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> had just been shot. Within a few hours Secretary Usher was back in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and had joined Stanton and Welles at the bedside of the dying
                    President. There, through the saddest hours of our nation's history,
                    these faithful friends kept their heart-breaking vigil until in the gray dawn
                    one of them said: "Now he belongs to the ages." John P. Usher
                    could hardly speak freely of those hours. Of the little that the father may have
                    said, the son remembers less, and that no more than some of the statements about
                    the ghastly, physical features that were connected with the death-bed scene.</p>
            <p>As is well known, the murder-plot led also to an attack on Secretary Seward that
                    almost caused his death, and to other murderous attempts, and possibly
                    contemplated the massacre of the entire Cabinet. About the fatal hour,
                    mysterious strangers appeared at Secretary Usher's home and it could be
                    that his brief trip to Relay Junction saved his life.</p>
            <p>Of all Linton Usher's memories and memorials of war-time <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, nothing is more impressive than the autograph album opening with <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s copy from the Second Inaugural. Following that priceless
                    page are greetings, mottoes, counsels, and endearments, signed by the
                    vice-president, Andrew Johnson; the future vice-president, Henry Wilson; Chif
                    Justice Chase and other justices of the Supreme Court; all of the Cabinet
                    members; Generals Grant, Sherman, Sheridan <pb n="402" id="VAA4025-034-4-010"/>
                    and ten other distinguished soldiers; such naval chiefs as Farragut and Fox; the
                    French minister, Comte de Chambrun; the orator Wendell Phillips; the Senators,
                    John Sherman, Charles Sumner and a dozen more who were then powerful leaders in
                    Congress; such authors as Walt Whitman, Lew Wallace and Albion W. Tourgee; C. A.
                    Dana and J. W. Forney, world-famous journalists—in all eighty-four
                    names and every one of them significant. These autographs were collected by
                    Margaret Paterson Usher, in the early spring of 1863, as an heirloom for her
                    children. It is noteworthy that she did not include the name of any man who had
                    been an antagonist of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In spite of such exceptions, it is an adequate <hi rend="i">dramatis personae</hi> of the great American tragedy. A composite biography
                    of these eighty-four men, including their contacts and conflicts, would give
                    much of the story of the Civil War. One may ask if there is anywhere else in the
                    world any collection made at any one time of the signatures of so many men who
                    personify one of the major epochs of history?</p>
            <p>A few weeks after <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s death, Secretary Usher resigned from the Cabinet to
                    become the General Solicitor of the Union Pacific Railroad. Concluding his
                    political career, he resumed the professional career in which he was no less
                    eminent. During many of the ensuing years, he resided at Lawrence, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName>. He died in 1889, one day before the anniversary of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s assassination.</p>
            <p>When a schoolboy, Linton Usher went hunting on Staten Island. That was where the
                    West began for him. Or had it begun in the Indian Bureau of his
                    father's Department of the Interior? At any rate, when the time came
                    for him to go to college he had "another idea." The other idea
                    was the West. That was the college for him. Out in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> was a part of his father's Wild-West
                    principality—a quarter of a million acres. It had to be surveyed.
                    Linton thought he had to survey it. It was boyhood's shouting response
                    to the challenge of destiny. In 1867, at the age of fifteen, he enrolled in
                    "Wilderness University."</p>
            <p>The subsequent pattern of his activities traces one of the vital factors in the
                    civilizing of the untamed West. After the youth had surveyed his
                    father's lands to his liking, he began <pb n="403" id="VAA4025-034-4-011"/> to shuttle back and forth over the long Chistholm
                    trail, buying, shepherding, shipping the thundering herds of the dusty
                    Southwest. Down through Ft. Worth to Austin, associated there with the opulent
                    and lordly Driscolls, then from Austin to Tombstone and betimes to old <placeName>
                        <country reg="mx">Mexico</country>
                    </placeName>. But oftener, he went to New <placeName>
                        <country reg="mx">Mexico</country>
                    </placeName> and the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName> panhandle, and from these various places back to eastern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName>. For some thirty years, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Leavenworth</settlement>
                    </placeName> was thus his base of operation. With his father, he went to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">San Francisco</settlement>
                    </placeName> while it was still somewhat in the raw. There they visited their
                    friends, the McLaughlins, whose vast cow-ranches and horse-ranches engaged the
                    younger Usher's eager interest. When offered a fine wheat farm his
                    answer was, "No d—– wheat in mine."</p>
            <p>Back in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> again, Linton Usher married a kinswoman of his own fine family
                    stock. For the remaining years of her life, she kept the home-haven at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Leavenworth</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Then, after her early death and the death of their little son, the
                    Odyssey of the surviving husband and father was still maintained, until, with
                    the years, he had woven his way through every state in the Union save one, and
                    also <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <country reg="mx">Mexico</country>
                    </placeName>. In 1904, he married Charlotte Dicker of Lawrence, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName>. They resided first in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>
                    </placeName>, then successively in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mtu">Montana</region>
                    </placeName>, Vancouver, and Aransas Pass, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName>. Still he went adventuring far and near, usually dealing in cattle,
                    but occasionally in mines and oil-wells. As late as 1918, he went all over the
                    West in an automobile, looking for a "likely" ranch. In 1923,
                    he settled at last on the old parental lands at Pomona, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName>. Here he still rides his range of nearly two thousand acres and
                    herds his five hundred cattle. And here the memories of Sacs and Foxes still
                    linger like living presences in his mind.</p>
            <p>Such men were indispensible to the constructive achievements of the West of
                    yesterday. What they did could not have been done either by the drifters or by
                    the settlers alone. The settlers had to leave too much behind them. But men like
                    Usher who tied their far-flung projects to an eastern base were the binders of
                    all America. These were the woof, the settlers the warp of the new and
                    miraculous fabric. Thus <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">St.
                        Louis</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Leavenworth</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>, like Constantinople through the Dark Ages, were the anchorages
                    binding the vast frontier country beyond to the social order.</p>

            <p>In Linton Usher's "Wilderness University," as perhaps
                    nowhere else in modern times, are we taught the historical significance of the
                    typical man and the typical event. Such men as Linton Usher, whether or not we
                    ascribe to them intrinsic greatness, are historical because they are the living
                    types of the life which is history itself. For instance, in what he calls a
                    "honky-tonky," in pioneer <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Denver</settlement>
                    </placeName>, he saw some women on the stage, half drunk, come dancing down the
                    aisles, singing—"It will all be forgotten in a hundred
                    years." But it will not be forgotten in a hundred years nor in a
                    thousand. Those poor honky-tonky girls could not know that the prodigious life
                    of which they were the bedraggled symbols, is sure to remain an epic of epics
                    for many a hundred years to come. The like of it had never been before and can
                    never be again.</p>
            <p>Another lesson of the "Wilderness University" is that the
                    spirit of adventure is a main factor in the making of security. If stable
                    civilization depended wholly on the stabilizers it could never get started. In
                    two remarks of Mr. Usher, he was the unconscious spokesman of history. When
                    asked in the fall when he would go South for the winter, he answered:
                    "I don't know. Some day when I feel like it, I'll go
                    right then. I've always been that way." The West could not
                    have been made without the men who were ready for sudden journeys and
                    unpremeditated projects. Only men who loved to take themselves by surprise could
                    have done the deeds and won the results that are now the wonder of the world.
                    Those who wait till they know why they are going, and how they are going, and
                    where they are going, are not the men who change the unknown into the known.</p>
            <p>Linton Usher remarked that he had never cared to get rich but only to see life.
                    To him and his kind, getting money seems to have been part of life, but keeping
                    it wasn't. There is your counter-poise to the dogma of economic
                    determinism. Why did the Goths raid the Roman Empire? Historians are wont to say
                    that it was because the Goths coveted the wealth of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rome</settlement>
                    </placeName>. But the "Wilderness University" should teach
                    them that those young Goths, like Linton Usher, Jedidiah Smith or Kit Carson,
                    wanted most of all to experience life, perhaps to "live
                    dangerously." Did Lindbergh fly the Atlantic because he had business in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName>? Did Peary and Amundsen go to the Poles because there was something
                    there that they wanted <pb n="405" id="VAA4025-034-4-013"/> to get? To economic
                    greed add both missionary zeal and a statesmanlike foresight, and did the three
                    of them constitute a greater factor than the spirit of adventure in the making
                    of the West?</p>
            <p>Usher, the old plainsman, seems disinclined to narrate the more adventurous of
                    his adventures. He tells no tall tales of killing deer, bear and bison.
                    Nevertheless his fishing and hunting trips sometimes took him into the remoter
                    wilds. And still he hunts and fishes with his old time ardor. He admires the
                    fighting adventurers, though he does not pose as one of them. Yes, he knew <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Buffalo</settlement>
                    </placeName> Bill: "When Bill was a young fellow he worked for my
                    father, and years afterwards he gave me tickets to his show. And those fellows
                    really were crack shots." The stories of their marksmanship are not
                    much exaggerated. Linton Usher saw them shoot. "Wild Bill Hickok? Saw
                    him a hundred times. He was an overbearing fellow. But he dug like a Trojan the
                    time we buried that poor fellow down by Fossil Creek."</p>
            <p>Here is the Fossil Creek story—One day "The Old
                    General" (not named) and "Old
                    K—–," an unpopular railroad president, with
                    Linton, were traveling by private coach, escorted by a cavalry squad. On
                    approaching Fossil Creek, in Western <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName>, they saw a white man near his cabin exchanging shots with Indians
                    in the brush by the creek. The Indians dispersed when they saw the soldiers. The
                    white man explained that his brother had gone to the creek for water and that
                    the Indians had killed him there. He begged for aid to recover his
                    brother's body. Old K—– was well scared, and at
                    his demand the soldiers were forbidden to go. But Linton went with the living
                    brother. They found that the victim had not been scalped, though a gash had been
                    made on the side of his head. They lifted him across a long musket and brought
                    him home. Linton found himself smeared with blood. By that time, a stage had
                    arrived and its guard was none other than the famous Wild Bill. Then it was that
                    Bill served as the vigorous grave-digger and remarked while digging:
                    "If that old K—– had been on my stage,
                    I'd have made him pay $500 or I'd have throwed him
                    to them Indians." When the journey was resumed, the mules drawing the
                    coach could hardly keep pace with the cavalry horses. The frightened railroad
                    magnate took the reins, whipped the mules till he drew blood, and at the
                    journey's end had whipped and <pb n="406" id="VAA4025-034-4-014"/>
                    driven some of them to death. The double inhumanity, to the squatter at the
                    creek and to the poor beasts, got rumored about and the Old General was blamed
                    for it, and was hailed before General <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hancock</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s court-martial. Then it was that the old friendship of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hancock</settlement>
                    </placeName> with the boy Linton whom he had known in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> became the means whereby the truth of the matter came to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hancock</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the Old General was promptly acquitted.</p>
            <p>Dick Wooten was another adventurer whom Linton knew. Wooten had made a bridge at
                    Raton Pass and held it as well as Horatius held the bridge in the brave days of
                    old. Neither man nor beast got through the pass without paying heavy toll. But
                    by and by the Santa Fe railroad came through and the curses of many cattle-men
                    were fulfilled—Dick Wooten was "busted."</p>
            <p>Among the many adventurers known to Linton none was more picturesque than Colonel
                    Stanley, who had commanded a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName> regiment during the Mexican War. Subsequently, he had been the
                    comrade in arms and trusted confidant of the romantic and now almost mythical
                    filibusterer, William Walker, "the gray-eyed man of destiny,"
                    who had made himself President of <placeName>
                        <country reg="nq">Nicaragua</country>
                    </placeName> and later was shot by a firing squad in <placeName>
                        <country reg="ho">Honduras</country>
                    </placeName>. Stanley seems to have walked in the ways of Walker-worship to the
                    end of his days. In his old age, when Linton Usher knew him, the Colonel was
                    still revelling in the vanity of dreams. The veterans of Walker's
                    private-crew had made up some kind of a tontine-pool which would enormously
                    enrich the last survivor of their band. Stanley was waiting in the impatience of
                    hope for two or three other old men to shuffle off, and he was the last one to
                    die.</p>
            <p>In the same "Wilderness University" was to be learned anew the
                    old historic fundamental that spontaneous law and order are the normal
                    prerequisites of established institutions. Without the former, the latter can be
                    created only with difficulty, if at all. Mr. Usher tells of big Dan Donahoe who
                    emerged from a grog-shop and remarked casually: "I saw there was going
                    to be a fight in there, so I knocked 'em all down and came
                    out." From such crude beginnings evolves the policing of the world.</p>
            <p>It was in 1869, that Usher discovered <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Denver</settlement>
                    </placeName>. There was one modest brick structure in the town, and not very
                    many frame buildings. Some of the latter were not modest. <pb n="407" id="VAA4025-034-4-015"/> Saloons and worse were everywhere. He was shown the
                    cottonwood tree which served for a gallows. Some prisoner broke jail. Bells rang
                    like a fire-alarm. The vigilantes rallied from everywhere. They overtook the
                    prisoner not far from town, shot him through the leg, tried him in lynch-court
                    and decided not to hang him. That negative marked distinct progress in the long
                    evolution of public order. It may conserve our historic slant to note that on
                    the same trip Linton Usher saw thousands of buffaloes through the car windows.</p>
            <p>Such primitive policing as that of Dan Donahoe and the vigilantes, with its
                    background of primitive society, indicates why the "constituted
                    authorities" were so often ineffective. Usher says that the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Marshals "were d—–
                    thieves." Be that as it may, they and other limbs of the law were not
                    of the natural growth of western life and could not be grafted upon it without a
                    lot of another kind of "grafting" and various sorts of
                    misfittings.</p>
            <p>Another historic principle re-evinced in Linton Usher's West is the
                    necessity of temporary compromise with disorder in the uncompromising struggle
                    for the permanent and better order. It seems now to readers and hearers of old
                    western tales that nothing was doing then but gambling, drinking and shooting.
                    At a Deadwood gambling-joint, for instance, Usher saw a "bushel of
                    gold, anyhow half a bushel, poured out on the table." His comment is
                    something to think about. "You didn't have to gamble if you
                    didn't want to, and it was their own money anyhow, and the shooting
                    wasn't going on all the time." The Wild West would tolerate
                    gambling, booze, and several kinds of rough stuff. Nevertheless, it had its code
                    of unpardonable sins—such as jumping claims to lands or mines,
                    fraudulent cattle-branding, cheating, cowardice, lack of generosity, and
                    mistreatment of decent women or helpless children. Suppose that all the decent
                    adventurers had taken time out to abolish all the vices of their
                    world—the West would have remained indefinitely a world of scenery,
                    buffalo herds, Indians, and vices. They chose rather the way of tolerance for
                    the time while they pursued their destined adventure in making another kind of
                    world.</p>
            <p>In every history of "new worlds" for "old"
                    there arises the hard problem of the beaten men and the beaten races. Linton
                    Usher had little trouble with Indians. His plan was the simple one of doing them
                    favors and making friends <pb n="408" id="VAA4025-034-4-016"/> with them:
                    "If you take care to make all the friends you can, they will take care
                    of the few who won't be friends. Try to treat them as well as they
                    think you treat white men. Don't try to bluff them and don't
                    let them bluff you." The worst in Indians, he has always believed, is
                    due mostly to the worst in white men.</p>
            <p>This is what Linton Usher has learned and taught in the school of the great West:
                    that the enterprisers who worked both East and West were the weavers of the
                    national fabric; that the typical rather than the great men and events should be
                    the essential substance of history; that the adventurers, as truly as the
                    settlers and investors, have been makers of the West; that spontaneous law is
                    the deep basis of the social order; that temporary compromise is necessary to
                    consistent progress; that some men at least have found it practical to befriend
                    the beaten races.</p>
            <p>With all his restless coming and going over the American world, Mr. Usher has
                    somehow found time for education through books. He has a large library. He has
                    been an appreciative and discriminating reader, and knows history and politics
                    in a rather masterly way. Old as he is in years, he is not mentally old, and, in
                    politics, he seems to be rather progressive with possible leanings to the left.
                    After all, he is so distinctly himself that he is hard to classify. His old age
                    (if that is what it is) is appropriate to the precedents of his long life. He
                    follows the seasons regularly, and sometimes the urge of his interests, all over
                    the map. When at home in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName>, he lives in a dignified country house, Mrs. Usher, their children
                    and grandchildren forming a congenial domestic and neighborhood circle. He is
                    the head of an unfallen House of Usher.</p>

            <p>Ebenezer Dumont was a teacher, lawyer, banker, soldier, and member of the
                    national House of Representatives. He taught school while studying law. He
                    married Mary Ann Cheek in 1838 or 1839. During the Mexican War he served as a

                    Dumont served as the President of the Indiana State Bank. At the beginning of

                    was an experienced legislator having earlier served in the Indiana legislature.
                    He was well read and quite a student of the Bible. He was an entertaining
                    speaker and popular with his colleagues. When it was known that he was to speak,
                    seats were sure to be filled. His drawling humor was much in evidence in his

                            Sess., Appendix, 162-166.) This was a speech in which the Representative
                            from Indiana criticised the Supreme Court for the decision in the
                            Garland case, "to the effect that the act of Congress requiring

                            indicate the content of the speech, but to illustrate the humor of
                            Dumont. The whole speech abounds in humorous sallies which there is not
                            space to quote. Before opening his remarks, the gentleman from Indiana
                            asked the Clerk of the House to read the following paragraph: <quote rend="blockquote">"A hotel keeper in <placeName>

                            to the speech that followed, and was evidently used to wake up the
                            audience as the Congressman intimated.</item>
                  <item>In another part of the speech, Dumont told a story from back home in
                            Indiana, which is worth repeating. Here it is: <quote rend="blockquote">"A constituent of my colleague [John H. Farquhar], in

                                responded the gruff old clerk, who, when enraged and indignant, was
                                a little rough and profane; `I'll swear you in; all

            <p>Ebenezer Dumont had a family of seven daughters, towards whom he is said to have
                    played the part of a strict Victorian father. His eldest daughter was Fanny. She
                    married David Braden in 1858, who became a captain in the Civil War. She lived
                    to be ninety-four years old, dying in 1934. During the Civil War, she took her

            <p>Ebenezer's second daughter, Julia Dumont, was given the name of his
                    mother. In 1862, she married Major Jonathan W. Gordon. He served in the Mexican
                    War and also in the Civil War for about three years. Julia was Major
                    Gordon's second wife. They had five daughters, and one son named John

                    least two children, a daughter who married George M. Cole, and a son, Lieut.
                    Thomas Dumont Watson. The fifth daughter of Ebenezer, Isabelle Dumont, married
                    John W. Williams. She was still living in 1934. The sixth daughter, Anna Dumont,

                    after her mother's death took her place in looking after and caring for
                    her father and three of her brothers. Next to the youngest brother, having made
                    his home with his Grandmother Detraz for several years, due to his
                    mother's ill health, continued to do so after her death. Martha Detraz

            <p>The eldest brother of Martha Detraz, William Benjamin, died in 1888 at the age of
                    twenty-nine. The second brother, Eugene Rodolph, and the youngest or fourth,
                    Clarence Aime, made up the firm of the Detraz Brothers who were in the lumber,
                    building, and planing-mill business in <placeName>

                    lived so long, now occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Herman L. Fox. The third of the four
                    brothers, Samuel Francis Detraz, married Amy Lewark in Pendleton, Indiana, where
                    he and his brothers had gone to build and establish a planing mill.
                    Samuel's brothers never married. This Samuel F. Detraz was an architect

                    earlier, in 1911. He was generally known as "Frank" Detraz. He
                    left three children, Lucille, Louisa and Orville Detraz. Orville married Mildred
                    Bliss in 1927. They have two sons, David Francis and Orville Richard Detraz, and

                    until the assistant was practically placed in charge of the auditor's
                    office, while the man chosen to fill the place devoted his time to his growing
                    law practice. The young attorney was instrumental in obtaining for his assistant
                    the position as deputy sheriff. Though his duties were doubled, Lamb still read
                    law at intervals and was admitted to the bar. He then became a law partner of
                    his friend Dumont. In 1848, Mr. Lamb was elected to the office of prosecuting
                    attorney, and, following the death of young Dumont was appointed to complete his
                    term as auditor. In 1850, Mr. Lamb was defeated, but in 1855 he won the race for
                    auditor. He held the office till 1859, while he continued to practice law.</p>

            <p>Julia, the fourth and youngest of the four Dumont sisters was her
                    mother's namesake. She was a teacher, holding forth in the old
                    schoolroom after the death of her mother. In fact, she had served an
                    apprenticeship by helping her mother. In 1859, she married the Rev. Archibald S.
                    Reid, who was both a teacher and preacher. As late as 1870, Mrs. Reid advertised
                    the opening of a school. School terms were often quite short even after the
                    establishment of a public system, and it was not uncommon for extra subscription
                    schools to follow. Mrs. Reid collected all of the unprinted writings of her
                    mother, Julia L. Dumont, intending to have them published, but after the Reid

                    to be united at a designated rendezvous. It was a good plan, only Bienville was
                    a month late. The associated French and Indians from the north proceeded to make

                    </placeName> told the Iroquois of the glorious British victories over the
                    French. The reply of the shrewd Canassatego was somewhat unexpected:
                    "You tell us you beat the French, if so you must have taken a great
                    deal of rum from them, and can the better spare us some of that liquor to make
                    us rejoice with you in the victory." Thomas gave them some in small
                    glasses, which he called French glasses. The next day Canassatego intimated that
                    it was a little distasteful to celebrate British victories by drinking from
                    French glasses: he desired to drink rum from English glasses, which were
                    considerably larger. Thomas acceded, informing the Indians as he did so, that,
                    "We are glad to hear that you have such dislike for what is French.
                    They cheat you in your glasses as well as in everything else." This

            <p>While Croghan tarried at Pickawillany in February, 1751, chiefs of the Piankashaw
                    and Wea Indians came, seeking alliance with the English. Although Croghan had no
                    authority to do so, he drew up a treaty of alliance, which was signed by
                    himself, Gist, Andrew Montour, and three other fur traders. When Croghan
                    reported what he had done to Lieutenant-Governor <placeName>

                    acting in publick matters without his orders." The Assembly replied
                    that they would "readily concur" with <placeName>

                    Piankashaws "helped to seduce other tribes from the French"
                    and killed seven Frenchmen. Thirty-three Piankashaws turned up at <placeName>

                    </placeName> and obtained munitions from the French commandant on the plea of
                    making war on the Cherokees. The commandant discovered that the Piankashaws had

                    the traders erected a building for their headquarters, surrounded by "a

                    instigators of revolt and the source of all our woes." From the French

            <p>It was certainly worth all of that amount to the French cause. In the spring of

                    encounter and destroy a small French expedition commanded by Coulon de
                    Jumonville. The French ever afterward claimed that Jumonville was assassinated
                    as he was having a summons read to <placeName>

                    upon whether war or peace obtained. After the seizure of a British fort

                    Anglo-French wars in America usually began with some overt act or acts rather
                    than with proclamations. Under such circumstances a military commander had to
                    decide on his own responsibility whether bands of his neighbors whom he might
                    encounter sauntering in the forest were peaceful or otherwise. In any case,
                    there could be no peace after <placeName>

                    opened the French and Indian War, although the honor is sometimes bestowed on

                        French."<hi rend="sup">59</hi> There were many reasons why the
                    savages adjured the English cause. One was the notorious injustice to Indians

                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">60</hi> Conrad Weiser tried repeatedly to secure the
                    "administration of justice locally in Indian affairs." On the
                    frontier "very few magistrates … would administer law where
                    an Indian was concerned."<hi rend="sup">61</hi> Another cause of
                    dissatisfaction was the encroachment of settlers on Indian soil. The attempts of
                    Sir William Johnson and other colonial officials to run a line between the
                    Indian hunting grounds and the white settlements failed because the settlers
                    would not be bound. In 1749 Croghan warned the <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s "Walking Purchase" of 1737 rankled in
                    the minds of the savages for generations. But the vital, controlling cause of
                    Indian disaffection toward the British lies in the aggressive advance of the
                    French in the <geogName>Ohio valley</geogName>. Nothing impresses an Indian so
                    much as power. This thought is nowhere expressed more clearly than in the speech
                    of Hendrick, Mohawk sachem, to the <placeName>

                    successful was the French aggression that the entire scene of conflict was

                    there is no doubt that it was, in America, a war for the control of the fur

                            </placeName>, the contest there began about your right of trading in the
                            Indian country, a right you had by the treaty of Utrecht, which the
                            French infringed; they seized the traders and their goods, which were
                            your manufactures; they took a fort which a company of your merchants,
                            and their factors and correspondents, had erected there, to secure that
                            trade. Braddock was sent with an army to retake that fort (which was
                            looked on here as another encroachment on the king's territory)
                            and to protect your trade. It was not until after his defeat that the
                            colonies were attacked. They were before in perfect peace with both
                            French and Indians; the troops were not therefore sent for their
                            defence. The trade with the Indians, though carried on in America, is
                            not an American interest. The people of America are chiefly farmers and
                            planters; scarce anything that they raise or produce is an article of
                            commerce with the Indians. The Indian trade is a British interest; it is
                            carried on with British manufactures, for the profit of British
                            merchants and manufacturers; therefore, as it commenced for the defence
                            of territories of the crown, the property of no American, and for the
                            defence of a trade purely British, was really a British war.<hi rend="sup">66</hi>

            <p>The newly acquired Indian tribes, formerly attached to <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>, were quick to compare the treatment of the Indians by the two
                    nations. The French garrisons had always treated Indians "with
                    attention and respect." English officers gave the visiting redskins
                    "cold looks and harsh words." Those lounging around British
                    forts "met with muttered ejaculations of impatience or abrupt orders to
                    depart, enforced, perhaps, by a touch from the but of a sentinel's
                        musket."<hi rend="sup">71</hi> The British no longer felt the the
                    need to avoid offending the savages, who, "no longer important as
                    allies, were treated as barbarians." The Iroquois asked that the
                    officers at posts "behave in a brotherlike manner toward us."
                    The Indian complaints of ill treatment at forts, which were general, were not
                    believed by Major-General Jeffery Amherst, British Commander-in-Chief in
                    America, who thought the alleged ill treatment was probably "necessary
                    Checks which the Commanding officers are obliged to give them, in their Drunken
                    Frolicks." Amherst had little use for the Indians—in time of
                    peace—and he desired to abolish the giving of presents. He objected
                    to the large sums Johnson and Croghan were spending on Indian presents.
                    "Services must be rewarded," he wrote to Johnson, February 22,
                    1761, "but as to purchasing the good behavior either of Indians, or any
                    Others, is what I do not understand; when men of what race soever behave ill,
                    they must be punished but not bribed."<hi rend="sup">72</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Johnson felt that it was necessary to purchase Indian friendship "with
                    favours and notice." The French, he said, realized that however
                    expensive it might be to give presents, "they wisely foresaw that it
                    was infinitely cheaper, and much more effectual than the keeping a large body of

                    presence of forts in hostile Indian country could not protect the fur trade.
                    That could only be done by the maintenance of friendly relations with the
                    Indians, and not only was it cheaper to do this by giving presents but it was
                    "more certain of success."</p>
            <p>It is necessary to emphasize the historical importance of Amherst's
                    policy relative to Indian presents. More than all else this policy was
                    responsible for the Indian unrest throughout America, an unrest that ended in a
                    war that cost the British many times more than the presents, not to mention the
                    losses sustained through the cessation of the fur trade during the hostilities.
                    It is significant that Amherst maintained his economy order over the protest of
                    every officer in America having anything to do with Indian affairs. Throughout
                    the country the Indians were talking of the matter. Croghan reported from Fort
                    Pitt in May, 1762, that the Indians declared that, "ye French was butt
                    a poor peple butt they allways Cloathed any Indians that was poor or Naked when
                    they Come to see them. … "<hi rend="sup">74</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Amherst not only refused presents but made threats. He ordered Johnson to tell
                    the Indians "to adhere firmly to His Majesty's
                    Interest," for if they did not do so, <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>On April 30, 1763, Croghan reported to Amherst that the western Indians were
                    uneasy because the King of <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> had ceded their lands without their consent. Amherst returned a
                    bombastic reply declaring that it was quite unimportant what the Indians
                    thought, "as it is to their interest to behave peaceably, and while
                    they continue to do they may be assured of His Majesty's
                        Protection."<hi rend="sup">76</hi> For a commander with but meagre
                    military forces available, Croghan thought "Gineral Amhurst"
                    as he called him spoke very rashly. Very soon it was His Majesty, or rather His
                    Majesty's representatives, who sought protection—and from
                    the Indian allies of all people! Under the circumstances it is ludicrous to find

            </p>
            <p>During 1761 and 1762, several Indian plots were discovered and forestalled, but
                    in 1763 the storm broke. The leader was a chief of the Ottawas named Pontiac:
                    "The genius of Pontiac united and enthused the natives; the French
                    traders spread rumors to incite the savages against the English."<hi rend="sup">78</hi> It seems probable that French military and colonial
                    officials helped to spread such rumors by their indiscreet apologies for the
                    French withdrawal and prophecies of their early return. Pontiac afterwards told
                    Croghan (Novémber, 1765) that the trouble had been stirred up by the
                    French and called the Pontiac Conspiracy, a "Bever War."<hi rend="sup">79</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Pontiac revolt included the Senecas and most of the western tribes. For an
                    Indian rebellion, it was extraordinarily successful. West of Niagara, the
                    savages captured all English forts except two—<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Fort Pitt—and these two were invested, with Pontiac
                    in personal command at the siege of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Croghan reported to the Lords of Trade, that, during the summer of
                    1763, the Indians killed and captured 2,000 British subjects, drove thousands
                    "to Beggary and the greatest distress," captured and destroyed
                    nine forts, and plundered troops and traders to the extent of

                    were incredibly deceived. All unite in reporting Pontiac to be an Indian of
                    amazing ability and influence. In 1764, General Gage reported that the <placeName>

                    striking feature of Pontiac's career: his influence beyond his own
                    tribe. Both Gage and Johnson declared in December, 1764, that Pontiac's

                    determined to prevent the resumption of the Indian trade. In the spring of 1765,
                    Croghan was ordered on a mission to the western country. The traders obtained
                    his permission to send their trade goods to Fort Pitt with the Indian presents
                    in anticipation of the re-opening of the fur trade. A group of settlers led by
                    Captain James Smith, disguised as Indians who came to be known as
                    "Black Boys," attacked the party, "killed a few
                    Horses, and burnt and destroyed above fourscore Horse-Loads of Indian goods;

                    therein to the American authorities "with all convenient
                    speed." The British retained these posts for thirteen years, and both

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Government and American historians have claimed that the principal
                    reason Great Britain desired the posts was the retention of control of the fur
                    trade. "The letters passing between Haldimand on the one hand and North
                    and Sydney on the other," says McLaughlin, "show that this was
                    in the minds of the Canadian authorities and the English ministry." And
                    it may now be stated positively, declares A. L. Burt, that "the British
                    archieves contain reams of documents which provide fine ammunition for the

            <p>With close of hostilities, American fur traders swarmed into the western
                    territory in such numbers that Haldimand, governor of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>, warned the post commanders to be on their guard, as the newcomers
                    might try to occupy the posts. Canadian fur traders asked that new posts be
                    established. The enormous value of the fur trade goes far toward explaining
                    their anxiety. In 1785, the Canadian fur trade was reported to amount to
                    £180,000 per annum, of which £100,000 came from lands
                    belonging to the <placeName>

            <p>In the end, the British Government may have decided to yield posts, among other
                    reasons, because the wars growing out of the French Revolution had wrecked the

                    </placeName>'s decisive defeat of the savages in 1794, had seriously
                    interfered with the fur trade. It is not surprising that the business was
                    scarcely mentioned in the negotiations preceding Jay's Treaty. In any

                    &amp; Sons. After the older Swing's death in 1826, the firm became
                    W. G. &amp; G. W. Ewing. The Swings were at first friendly to
                    Astor's American Fur Company and obtained their trade goods from
                    Astor's man at <placeName>

                    commission in America and Europe. This brought them into direct competition with
                    Astor's company, but the two firms continued to be friendly for a

            <p>Both the American Fur Company and the Ewings had troubles with their traders, but
                    the Ewings were more diplomatic in maintaining internal peace. On one occasion
                    in 1828 one of the Rousseau brothers wrote to his employers:
                    "Gentlemen, i think you are very deceitful." The Ewings
                    handled the situation delightfully: they presented Mr. Rousseau with a

            <p>In the eighteen-thirties, fashionable people began to admire the silk hat. As a
                    result Ramsay Crooks, of the American Fur Company, wrote, June 17, 1838, that
                    "Rats, Beavers &amp; Otters are dead stock." Beaver prices
                    tumbled and raccoon prices rose. This was a boon to the Maumee-<placeName>

                    </placeName> trade since that region "produced enormous numbers of
                    raccoons" and as a result "became for a few years the center
                    of interest of the fur business of America."<hi rend="sup">108</hi> In
                    the ensuing boom of the trade, the Ewings and the American Fur Company engaged
                    in a trade war (1838). The following year a trade agreement was tried but it did
                    not work very well, so war was resumed. It was a cut-throat competition with no
                    holds barred. G. W. Ewing who was a member of the Indiana state senate,
                    introduced a bill in January, 1840, laying a heavy tax upon the American Fur
                    Company! The bill passed the senate but failed in the house. N. D. Grover
                    reported from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName> that if any legislator voted for Ewing's bill
                    "his Hide will be on the fence and well Stretched at that."
                    Ramsay Crooks was enraged at Ewing's bill. He "denounced it as
                    unconstitutional and planned resistance." Having failed to get this
                    bill enacted into law, Ewing privately wrote to Crooks suggesting that peace be
                    made! Crooks replied in some heat, on July 31, 1840: <text>

            <p>However, both firms used discretion for two years. In 1842, war was resumed on a
                    broad scale and was only ended by the bankruptcy of the American Fur Company.
                    That did not help the Ewings much as they too were in financial difficulties.
                    Also, the fur trade was dwindling. The lines of the Indian country in Indiana
                    had been gradually constricted, almost from the beginning. Most of the savages
                    had migrated and the years 1846–1848 mark the end of the important

            <p>Throughout all time it has been the habit of mankind to worship anything which
                    seemed to him good or powerful, wonderful or mysterious. To the eyes of
                    primitive men, for example, what could have been more glorious and divine than
                    the sun, symbolizing to all as it did the source of heat, of light, and of life
                    itself?</p>
            <p>The Greeks loved to personify the mysterious forces of nature which at one time
                    had been worshiped as abstractions. Aesculapius differed from these. He studied
                    medicine and became the greatest physician of his age. He devoted all of his
                    time to the study of the human body and to its proper care. Great wonders were
                    accomplished by his wizardy. He was believed to bring the dead to life. His
                    success, unfortunately, was short-lived. Jealousy drove Zeus to destroy this man
                    of unusual power, but repenting, the god admitted Aesculapius into the company
                    of immortals on Mount Olympus. Temples were built to the great physician and he
                    was worshipped for two thousand years as the god of medicine in all of the great
                    cities of the ancient world.</p>
            <p>Primitive man, with his untutored mind and his unrestrained imagination was
                    impelled to worship whatever was awe inspiring for any reason. In the serpent,
                    primitive man found an animal that exerted a greater influence over him than any
                    other living thing. By its bite, it could inflict a sudden and mysterious death.
                    Without organs of locomotion, it could glide with incredible speed over rocks or
                    through dense jungles. It could hold so much of its body erect in the air that
                    it became a phallic emblem. Time could work no weakening spell upon it. Each
                    year, it cast off its old vesture and came forth in the new and resplendent
                    rainment of youth. It was believed that it never died a natural death. Such a
                    creature was sure to be deified wherever tribes of men lived over the earth.</p>
            <p>One characteristic of Aesculapius was the carrying of a wand or rod, around which
                    a serpent was gracefully coiled. One of his daughters, Hygeia, promoted health
                    and prevented disease by feeding and caring for the sacred serpents in the
                    temple. The effect of this activity upon the people was most remarkable. The
                    serpent came to be regarded as a <pb n="444" id="VAA4025-034-4-052"/> symbol of
                    good health, his chief power being to heal the sick. People believed in the
                    serpent as an antidote to its own venom and other deadly poisons. This belief
                    existed until the day when Christianity subverted the old creeds and became the
                    state religion of the Roman Empire. The Hebrew belief that there was but one God
                    was spread over the European world by Christians. The result of the
                    transformation was the passing of idols and old practices and even Aesculapius
                    drifted into obsecurity.</p>
            <p>The serpent was no longer considered a benefactor to man and slumped back to its
                    level as just a deadly, poisonous snake. Still, however, men believed in the
                    healing power of this despised animal. Physicians from the time of Galen until
                    the middle of the seventeenth century, experimented and found that diseases,
                    which were poisonous and deadly, could be cured by the essence of the serpent.</p>
            <p>When the essence of vipers was cast from the British Pharmacopoeia, people had
                    been coming to the New World in vast numbers for a century and a quarter. They
                    were a plain, practical people, devoid of imagination or love of nature. They
                    knew none of the mythological lore of the ancient world. They never heard Pan
                    piping or saw numphs dancing in New World woodlands. Though the trees that they
                    saw surpassed in majesty and loftiness the Druidic sanctuaries of Britain or the
                    oak groves of Dodona, their only thought in contemplating such magnificent
                    specimens was a calculation of the amount of hard labor required to send one of
                    them crashing to the earth. Nevertheless, colonists discovered interesting
                    species of poisonous serpents. But their only thought when seeing them was of
                    inflicting speedy death upon them as they did upon every other wild creature.
                    They even exterminated the deer, the passenger pigeon, and later the bison.</p>
            <p>In the stern contest with hostile Nature which the pioneers waged in the western
                    world they encountered many dangers to health and even to life. Malarial and
                    yellow fevers, typhoid fever, and small pox, none of which they knew how to
                    prevent or treat, exacted a heavy toll of lives, besides incalculable suffering.</p>
            <p>Poisonous snakes were another source of danger. Of these, the rattlesnake was the
                    most widely distributed and most dangerous. Also the copperhead and the moccasin
                    each <pb n="445" id="VAA4025-034-4-053"/> constituted a serious menace. Not only
                    the venomous but the non-venomous snakes were so numerous that the possibility
                    of sudden encounter with some variety of snake was never absent from the mind of
                    every settler. The pioneer woman, leaving the house to hoe in her garden, or
                    hunt the nests of straying turkeys, or pick the delicious blackberry, always
                    carried a "snake stick" in her hands for use in dispatching
                    any serpentine enemy which she might find in her pathway.</p>
            <p>Though the people of America, neither worshiped the serpent as divine nor feared
                    it as the incarnation of some evil spirit, they nevertheless often gave credence
                    to some very incredible superstitions—superstitions which the elder
                    Pliny would have recorded with the greatest delight in his "Natural
                    History." For instance, the pioneers of the <geogName>Ohio</geogName>
                    and <geogName>Mississippi Valleys</geogName> believed in the existence of a
                    "glass snake," so called because it was fabled to break, when
                    struck with a stick, into a score of fragments. Though the head of this snake
                    might not have more than two or three inches of neck attached to it and though
                    the reptilian heart might have been beating in a separate fragment of the body
                    several inches from the head, the eyes could still see and the brain preserve an
                    attitude of watchful waiting until the assailant had departed, whereupon the
                    bloody fragments would join themselves together in a few seconds and the reptile
                    would glide away with unbelievable celerity.</p>
            <p>A certain kind of snake, a rather heavy bodied black snake, was called a milk
                    snake. It was reputed to follow the dairy cows as they grazed in the fields.
                    When a cow was standing motionless or lying down in the shade to chew her
                    "cud," the snake would take the cow's teats in its
                    mouth one by one and extract all the milk it could hold.</p>
            <p>Another very horrendous reptile believed to exist in pioneer days was the
                    "hoop snake." It had a horn on its tail as sharp as a
                    cobbler's awl. When attacking a foe, whether man or beast, the hoop
                    snake took this horn in its mouth, assumed the form of a buggy-wheel tire and
                    rolled with great speed in the direction of its adversary. When within reach of
                    its enemy it uncoiled and stuck its horn deeply into the flesh of its victim. If
                    it happened to strike the leg, the recipient of the wound would die in a few
                    hours. However, if the person attcked stepped aside, the blow aimed at him <pb n="446" id="VAA4025-034-4-054"/> might be received by a nearby tree. In that
                    case the foliage of the stricken tree soon began to wither and fall to the
                    ground, and, in a few days, the tree would die.</p>
            <p>In treating persons for the painful and sometimes fatal effects of the bites of
                    rattlesnakes and copperheads, reliance was placed larely upon very free
                    stimulation with alcohol. Sometimes the amount of whiskey or brandy administered
                    to a sufferer from snake bite was so large that it might well be suspected that
                    death was due to acute alcoholic poisoning rather than to serpent venom.</p>
            <p>Decoctions of various plants and leaves were used, and the Old World use of the
                    flesh of the serpent and the external application of "snake
                    oil" to antidote the venom of its bite were of frequent application.</p>
            <p>There is an incident in the family history of the writer that he will now
                    recount. It did not occur in his time, but it is of such passing interest to the
                    student of folk-lore because of the ancient origin and beautiful symbolism of
                    the practices evoked by its occurrence, that a description of it seems
                    peculiarly apt in this article.</p>
            <p>In the year 1830, Garrett Terhune, great-grandfather of the writer, then living
                    in Mercer County, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, decided to try his fortunes in the wilderness of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Johnson County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. He loaded his wife and nine children, together with his
                    worldly goods, including the family Bible, the chopping axes and the trusty
                    rifle, into two, four-horse covered-wagons and started on the toilsome journey
                    overland. The teams tramped laboriously over the hills of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, through the dust and burning heat of August days.</p>
            <p>The <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> was reached at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Milton</settlement>
                    </placeName> just across from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. The yellow flood was crossed on a rickety ferryboat. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> was then the metropolis of Indiana—the river port where
                    steamboats came to receive the various products of the farms of southern
                    Indiana, the town to which furs and venison, pork, wheat, and droves of hogs and
                    cattle were brought by slow stages for shipment. Climbing the long hill that
                    rose from the River on the Indiana side, was a laborious process in which teams
                    had to be doubled and each wagon taken up singly.</p>
            <p>Then followed a journey of sixty-eight miles to the tract of land in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Johnson County</region>
                    </placeName> which had been selected for the future home. Confinement in the
                    jolting wagons was intolerable <pb n="447" id="VAA4025-034-4-055"/> to the
                    children, and all but the babies insisted on getting out and walking. The roads
                    were dusty on the hills, but muddy and almost impassable in the bottoms.
                    Sometimes the corduroy of the roads was so rough, or the gullies so deep, that
                    long detours had to be taken through the woods bordering the crude highway. The
                    little herds of cattle, hogs, and sheep had to be watched with the utmost
                    vigilance to prevent their loss.</p>
            <p>Each night a camping place was found near some spring or stream of water.
                    Sometimes two or three days were spent in camp in order that the horses and
                    cattle might pluck a meager sustenance from the green shrubbery of the thickets
                    and the scant grass of the open glades. While waiting for the stock to feed, the
                    women washed the much needed clothing, baked bread, made coffee, and broiled
                    wild game over the coals of a wood fire. The men mended broken harness, soaked
                    loose-tired wagon wheels in the creek, or replenished the scant larder by
                    hunting and fishing.</p>
            <p>The summer had been dry and through the hills of southern Indiana, the mud was
                    not troublesome, save in Bartholomey County, where torrential rains fell and the
                    roads became sloughs of mud with the chuck-holes hub deep in water. The movers
                    were delayed a few days at Edinburg because Blue River could not be crossed. But
                    soon the skies cleared, the sun shone with tropic heat, the river shrank to its
                    former level and the journey was resumed.</p>
            <p>All were happy to think that on the morrow they would reach the site of their
                    future home when an incident occurred which threw the whole party into a state
                    of terror from which they did not recover for days. Garrett Terhune was driving
                    the forward team slowly up a hill when a boy with blue eyes and flaxen hair, who
                    was running on ahead with eager footsteps, sometimes in the middle of the road
                    and sometimes exploring the thickets on either side, suddenly felt a stinging
                    pain in his ankle and looking down saw what he thought was a copperhead snake.</p>
            <p>With a cry of horror, the lad started to run for the wagons at his utmost speed.
                    On the way he felt a deadly weakness, his heart fluttered, he grew faint, the
                    world turned black before his dazed eye. When he reached the wagons, he had
                    barely strength to tell what had happened. His father immediately sought the
                    always ready jug of whisky and <pb n="448" id="VAA4025-034-4-056"/> poured a
                    liberal supply down the boy's throat. With a small rope he corded
                    tightly the already swollen leg and taking his unsterilized pocket knife, the
                    same used to cut off pieces of his long green tobacco, he scarified deeply the
                    wounds where the poisonous fangs had entered. As soon as this was done, the
                    boy's sixteen-year-old sister, whose teeth were perfect, applied her
                    lips to the bleding wound and sought by suction to extract as much of the venom
                    as she could. But the boy's condition was so alarming and the whole
                    incident so terrifying to the family, that they carried the sufferer as rapidly
                    as possible to a cabin in a little clearing about half a mile away. By the time
                    they reached the house, the boy was covered with a cold sweat and seemed near
                    death.</p>
            <p>To the great relief of the parents, the family in the cabin were hospitable and
                    seemed intelligent enough to be really helpful. They comprehended at once the
                    necessity for instant relief. The man, of the place took immediate charge of
                    things and to his wife and two grown sons, he said, all in a breath: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Build a hot fire under the kittle! Git plenty o' hot water! Git
                            yer axes and cut that little blue ash tree down yander! Bring a big arm
                            load o' the leaves; Dig a hole in the gyarden, an' put

                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>All went to work with desperate haste. The kettle on the swinging crane in the
                    big fireplace soon had a roaring fire under it and was full to overflowing with
                    boiling water. The blue ash tree fell beneath lusty strokes of the ax; arm loads
                    of boughs were brought in, and the green leaves were put into the boiling water.</p>
            <p>As soon as the leaves were boiled, they were fished out of the blue water and
                    when cool enough were placed over the wound in a thick poultice. Then the boy
                    was carried into the garden, placed in the hole that had been dug, and covered
                    lightly to his waist with the fresh, cool earth. The man who lived in the cabin
                    in the clearing had perfect faith in what he was doing. The blue ash leaves, he
                    claimed, would work a magic cure. Moreover, he declared that by burying the boy
                    for awhile and then lifting him out the poison would be held down and buried by
                    the weight of the earth upon it.</p>
            <p>But in Garret Terhune's anguish of mind, he was not content to rely upon
                    magic in which he had no faith. So supporting the boy's head on a
                    pillow, he administered from <pb n="449" id="VAA4025-034-4-057"/> time to time
                    liberal potions of milk and whiskey, most of which were promptly ejected, but
                    which nevertheless helped to sustain the patient through his period of
                    depression. At night, he was moved into a bed in the house, and in two or three
                    days was able to be taken along with the wagons.</p>
            <p>To the practical mind of the boy's father, there was no magic in what
                    had been done. To him it was merely a local application of garden earth, a hot
                    fomentation of green leaves. But the writer, who now knows the origin of the
                    superstition "stretching dimly into the remote time, emerging darkly
                    out of the mysterious eternity," what that unknown frontiersman did
                    carried in its significance some of the most beautiful symbolism to be found in
                    the whole realm of folk-lore.</p>
            <p>In olden days severe illness of any kind was believed to be a form of possesion,
                    that is, an elf or evil spirit was thought to enter into the body of the
                    patient, or to jump upon his back like an old Man of the Sea and cling to him
                    tenaciously with arms tightly entwined about his neck. If such a patient were
                    temporally buried in the earth, the strange; hold of the evil spirit might be
                    broken, held down and suffocated by the weight of earth thrown upon him as the
                    patient was lifted out of his briefly used tomb. Sometimes when a patient was
                    being helped out of one of these temporary graves, the magician, or some kindly
                    bystander would say: "O earth, bear down with might and main!"
                    This explanation will suffice to make clear the purpose in view when the
                    author's grandfather was partly buried in the garden.</p>
            <p>Why the pioneer was so insistent upon the use of ash leaves requires a brief
                    explanation. In <placeName>
                        <country reg="ii">India</country>
                    </placeName>, central Asia, and southern Europe, there is a tree known in
                    scientific phraseology as the <hi rend="i">Fraximus Ornus.</hi> It is also found
                    in this country where it is popularly known as the "blue ash."
                    In olden times, this tree was much venerated and in the northern mythology it
                    was called "Yggdrasil" (the sacred ash), or "Tree of
                    the Universe" from which the gods formed mankind. It sprang from the
                    earth, but its trunk rose to the sky, and its branches supported the heavens. An
                    eagle with eyes like the sun sat in its branches and looked down upon everything
                    that was done in the whole world.</p>
            <pb n="450" id="VAA4025-034-4-058"/>
            <p>The sap of the Tree of the Universe was as sweet as honey, and honey dripped like
                    dew from its leaves. At its foot was a serpent (evil or darkness) that
                    constantly bit at its roots. But the serpent could do no harm, for the leaves of
                    the tree had power to cure its deadliest venom. When our Aryan ancestors left
                    the cradle of the race, traversed Persia, Asia Minor, and southern and central
                    Europe, in successive migrations, and crossed the channel into <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, they carried this superstition with them. Two thousand years ago
                    Pliny claimed that ash tree tops and leaves were a remedy for serpent bites:
                    "For," said he, "There is such antipathy between an
                    adder and an ash tree that if an adder be compassed round with ash tree leaves
                    it would sooner run through fire than through the leaves."</p>
            <p>Such are the reasons why James Terhune, when bitten by a poisonous snake in a
                    little <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Johnson County</region>
                    </placeName> clearing, was medicined so industriously with the same magic blue
                    ash leaves that were used by our Aryan ancestors in their first home thousands
                    of miles away, and centuries ago.</p>

            <head>SOCIAL STUDIES IN THE HIGH SCHOOL<hi rend="sup">*</hi>
            </head>
            <p>High school teachers of history are expected to do many things. Often they must
                    teach civics, economics, sociology, and current events in addition to history.
                    They are now almost universally designated as teachers of the social studies or
                    the social sciences. There is a chance for good work to be done where there are
                    several teachers in the department, for then there can be some division of
                    labor. In smaller high schools, the same person often has to teach all of the
                    social studies. The number of hours that high school students have the privilege
                    of taking in the social studies frequently calls for a sort of combined course
                    in several of the fields of social science.</p>
            <p>In such an assembled course, there may be little of anything well taught. The
                    discussions, when directed by a well informed and thoughtful teacher, can be
                    very interesting and helpful, but, if such courses encroach on the history work,
                    which is basic, the result is apt to be harmful to both teachers and students.
                    The teaching and study of a mass of varied subject-matter drawn from all of the
                    social sciences including current events is not apt to develop habits of
                    accuracy or lead to definite information. The teacher of such a course to be at
                    all successful must be widely read and be a constant student of a great variety
                    of current problems, for many of which no solution has as yet been discovered. A
                    teacher of social studies, with many and exacting extra-curricular duties,
                    surely finds it difficult at the best, to keep up in one or two of the social
                    sciences. It is expecting something little short of the miraculous that a high
                    school teacher shall be adequately informed in several difficult fields.</p>
            <p>The truth must be that few of those who teach orientation courses in social
                    science to high school students have any very clear ideas to present. One
                    wonders if the circumstances do not tempt or lead such teachers to become more
                    or less glib and fluent talkers whose superficial comment on social, economic
                    and political questions evaporates rapidly into thin air. One also wonders if
                    what the young boys and girls <list type="footnotes">

                            economics in a high school, in the hope that it will provoke present
                            high school teachers to write in defense of prevailing social studies
                            courses.</item>

                    much. With these troubling doubts in mind, the question naturally arises whether
                    it would not be a return to sanity if history courses were again to be more
                    strongly stressed. Basic courses in. European and American history have much to
                    be said in their favor.</p>
            <p>The subject-matter of history is tangible and interesting. Students can be
                    trained to do accurate and thoughtful work. They can discover how geography and
                    economic conditions have reacted on leaders and masses of people in the past,
                    and in turn how the human factor has entered in to help determine the direction
                    of the currents of history. Social, economic and political problems can not be
                    solved by high school students even if they give all their time to their study,
                    but, when studying history, they can be introduced to all of them. Every day, as
                    they learn history, they can observe the influence of geography and discover the
                    importance of the problems that from time to time confront society, the business
                    world, and agencies of government. The subject-matter of any course in history
                    is a laboratory and the facts are real chemicals with which students and
                    teachers may deal.</p>

                    Indian tribes of the Northwest were conferring with Capt. Joseph Brant looking

                    summers, the Indians were heard to say that, with their women and children at
                    their backs, they would hold their lands against the American pioneers. At this

            <p>As early as March of 1786, Filson had joined in an appeal to Clark for aid
                    against the probability of "total depopulation" of the
                    American inhabitants. And when he reached the Falls on June 19, he carried a
                    petition to Congress and a second appeal to Clark. The situation at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> reached a crisis between June 21 and the end of July and other
                    letters came to Clark. This correspondence, hitherto unpublished, presents an
                    interesting picture of the plight of the American families at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the summer of 1786, and provides a background for the ill-fated
                    expedition which Clark led against the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> tribes in the autumn of that year. They illustrate the conflict of
                    French and American ways of life at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the rising Indian menace, the possibilities of British
                    re-occupation, and the crying need for organized government in the Northwest.
                    They particularly reveal the land hunger of the pioneer, usually a squatter, or
                    "first settler" as he preferred to be called, moving into rich
                    lands in advance of land offices, surveys and titles. Under pressure of these
                    forces, Congress at length passed the Ordinance of 1787 and took military

                                        to you was on account that we were surrounded and detained
                                        to see the movement of the Enemy; likewise waiting for a

                                        grief is that I can give you neither as yet.</seg>

                                    there were three young men of their party stopped on the other
                                    side of the river who were asking to speak. At the break of day
                                    I sent the interpreters, accompanied by a few other Frenchmen,
                                    to listen to them. They said they were sent by their chiefs to
                                    warn the French that they were fifteen leagues away, at a place
                                    called River de la Mothe, with all their young warriors to the
                                    number of four hundred fifty, for the purpose of exterminating
                                    all the Americans who might be in these lands, and to avenge the
                                    treacheries which they were undergoing each day and the
                                    inhumanity which they have but recently exercised on one of
                                    them, begging me to meet them the same day, that they would
                                    unbosom themselves to me, and did not want to enter the village
                                    without having spoken to me.</p>
                        <p>Immediately on the return of these gentlemen and after having
                                    heard them, I caused to be assembled the magistrates, officers
                                    of our militia, and many other Frenchmen, who all of one accord
                                    were of the same opinion, and appeared resolved not to permit
                                    the savages to inflict any insults on the Americans established
                                    among them. Delighted and satisfied at such resolution, I at
                                    once ordered Major Bosseron to set out immediately for the
                                    purpose of going to meet this savage party, accompanied by
                                    Vaudry and by these chief interpreters, Antoine Gamelin, Pierre
                                        Gamelin,<hi rend="sup">27</hi> and many other Frenchmen,
                                    having given him two peace pipes and two white flags to stop
                                    them for me, and in the name of all the French to tell them not
                                    to enter this village in such great numbers, and that we enjoyed
                                    them to return peacefully to feed their women and their
                                    children; that we were resolved to defend our neighboring allies
                                    and to oppose their incursion. Immediately following the
                                    departure of Major Bosseron, I saw to the guard of the village,
                                    by putting everything in good shape, spirits in good order, and
                                    arms all ready for repulsing the blow which was threatening our
                                    neighboring allies. And after having warned the Americans of the
                                    danger they were in by reason of the number and the disposition
                                    of the barbarians, I urged them to take every precaution to
                                    protect and defend themselves; and that I was working in
                                    conjunction with all the French to avoid this fatal blow.</p>
                        <p>Major Bosseron, having halted on the little rock three miles from

                                    three red flags and two white flags. As soon as they had seen
                                    the French and the two flags planted on the rock, they came
                                    toward them and all debarked and shook hands and sat down very
                                    seriously. At once Major Bosseron caused to be lit one of the
                                    peace pipes to be presented to them by the hand of Vaudry,
                                    saying to them: "My brothers, I and all the Frenchmen

                                    respected and sent away the others with provisions for one day,
                                    strongly urging them to prevent their young men from approaching
                                    the village that night; that we and the Americans were on guard
                                    and had decided to open fire on the first person who presented
                                    himself. A part of the night I was in conference with them, to
                                    bring them to my viewpoint and to intimidate their spirits. The
                                    next day, the fifteenth, in the morning I prepared a present of
                                    trade goods to the value of five hundred

                                    to maintain the guard of the village, I embarked, accompanied by
                                    Vaudry and by these interpreters, Antoine Gamelin, Paul Gamelin,
                                    La Chinne, and many other Frenchmen.<hi rend="sup">30</hi> I
                                    found all the village heads and war chiefs seated on the river
                                    bank near the little rock, awaiting us, having arranged a place
                                    to receive us. I began to speak especially to three hot-heads as
                                    men feared among them. They decided to set out at once and
                                    without delaying longer, calling back their young men scattered
                                    on all sides. I sent some Frenchmen with them to whom they
                                    delivered two red flags which were brought to me. Having heard
                                    tell that there were some who were tearing down distant houses
                                    of the Americans where there was no one to pillage, I sent some
                                    of my Frenchmen there, who made them withdraw. After that no

                                    know not, have fallen on a band of Piankiashaws of this village
                                    and a band of Miamis, and without inquiring if they were friends
                                    or enemies, attacked them and killed six and wounded seven, all

                                    confirmed for us. Happily for all of us, the savages had no
                                    knowledge of this affair, which would have enraged them; and
                                    urged on by fury they would no longer have been willing to

                                    liquor. They rejoined them the same day, and since I had
                                    promised them this liquor to finish cleansing their hearts and

                                    far away. They accepted this liquor, which was turned over to
                                    them ten leagues above, with many marks of gratitude, and
                                    apparently expecting it, in view of the fact that I have been in
                                    the habit of giving to different ones a little present of from
                                    five to six bottles, as well as two beeves and two cows, and
                                    much bread which it was necessary to give them during all the
                                    councils, without forgetting the cup of milk. We have through
                                    precaution continued the guard during a few days, to avoid any
                                    surprise and to keep the spirits in good humor.</p>

                                    respectful by keeping them in close communication with us and
                                    the Americans, I greatly fear that this next autumn we shall not
                                    be able to succeed so well. For I foresee that unfortunately the
                                    savages will return in greater numbers. They have mentioned it
                                    on withdrawing, piqued at my having refused them the entry to
                                    the village. They said that they would return this autumn and
                                    that they would know how to make gates for entering without
                                    asking. This last affair of the Piankiashaws and the Miamis who
                                    were defeated on the plains by a party of Americans is going to
                                    annoy them greatly, authorize them and encourage them to join
                                    all together to form a strong party, in view of the fact that

                                    the Americans seek only to surprise and even betray those who
                                    are peaceful and their allies, which affords a pretext to all
                                    nations to band together and form numerous parties to attack
                                    entire villages. This last blow that outlaws have exercised on a

                                    been kindly disposed. He has already sent me in advance some
                                    bits of black shell to indicate to me his grief and his sorrow
                                    at seeing themselves killed and massacred by allies not content
                                    with killing them. They have cut them up and have hacked them
                                    into pieces and morcels, worse than they, barbarians, a thing
                                    which is repugnant to nature and which the very savages disdain
                                    for the Whites. They scorn those of us who exercise such
                                    cruelty. The sole means of preventing the blow which threatens
                                    us is to gain Lademoiselle, principally, and afterwards the
                                    other chiefs who have suffered in this affair. But the outlook
                                    is very dark and altogether barbarous. I admit to you that I
                                    greatly fear I shall not be able to succeed. Courage does not
                                    fail me nor our old interpreter, Vaudry, who has put all his
                                    knowledge to work to succeed, and all our men in general are
                                    still viewing them for me with the greatest suspicion. I foresee
                                    that if we are not able to succeed and if the savages come in as
                                    great numbers as they propose, we shall not be strong enough to
                                    defend ourselves; and that we shall be crushed by numbers. I
                                    have already written you on the subject of the number of outlaws

                                    majority of them cause trouble in this country, and will without

                                    recall them and make them withdraw from here. We also have one
                                    Sullivan who is a very dangerous man and pernicious to the

                                    the better, to avoid greater disorder which he might cause, and

                                    impression and the inhuman character which a few Americans, by
                                    letters filled with lies, have imputed to us and by which they
                                    have wished to blacken us. I am always flattered that you who
                                    for a long time have known my character and that of all the

                                    which we are exposed. And despite my misfortune, I have made

                        Federal Union: A Study in Commerce and Politics.</hi> By A. L. Kohlmeier,
                    The Principia Press, <placeName>

            <p>This significant monograph is concerned with the Old Northwest, its commerce with
                    the rest of the world, and its place in the Union. As a hinterland, its
                    well-being depended upon its ability to export its surplus commodities in
                    payment for its imports. There were three gateways for this commerce: the
                    southern, through <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>; the eastern, through the ports of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                    </placeName>; and the northeastern, through <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> or the St. Lawrence valley. The area within the <geogName>Ohio
                        valley</geogName> was settled first by immigrants from the southern and
                    middle states, who used the southern and eastern routes. Efforts to connect this
                    region with the South Atlantic ports failed; the Great Lakes area was settled by
                    people of New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> ancestry, who used the northeastern route; and the <geogName>Ohio
                        valley</geogName> grew less rapidly than the newer northern portions of the
                    Old Northwest. Commerce tended to expand with increasing population and
                    surpluses, and the routes of trade were improved. Politicians struggled with
                    sectional interests in respect to land policy, tariff, and internal
                    improvements. Polk's policy of western expansion and reduction of
                    tariffs, and the repeal of the British corn laws advanced the interests of the
                    Lower South and the Great Lakes region but did little for the <geogName>Ohio
                        valley</geogName>. <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> became more dependent upon wheat than upon cotton. The wheat
                    growing region, which became more firmly attached to the Northeast, secured
                    better prices and more settlers. The lower half of the Old Northwest, likewise,
                    became more firmly attached to the South, but its growth was now slower than
                    that of the nation as a whole.</p>
            <p>The danger of sectional cleavage in 1850 brought a realization of the value of
                    the Union to the Old Northwest. Efforts were made to bind North and South more
                    closely together, while transportation routes within and without the Old
                    Northwest were extended and improved. Little change resulted, however, and
                    exports produced north of the National Road were transported over the
                    northeastern channel while those of the <geogName>Ohio valley</geogName> were
                    sent through the eastern <pb n="469" id="VAA4025-034-4-077"/> or southern
                    gateways. During the middle fifties the sections struggled to secure the eastern
                    terminus of a proposed railway to the Pacific and sectional leaders again became
                    aggressive, but the west began to realize the importance of keeping all of its
                    commercial lines unbroken, because certain cities, like <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, were using all three outlets. Competition of the consolidated
                    railroads brought lower rates, thus proving the value of having alternate
                    routes. An enormous increase in the production of cereals and cattle in the
                    Great Lakes region enlarged commerce to the northwest. The eastern route,
                    drawing from the same area as well as the <geogName>Ohio valley</geogName>,
                    became almost as important as the southern route. The exports of the latter
                    increased absolutely but not relatively.</p>
            <p>Secession of southern states brought a crisis to the people of the Old Northwest. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> was a little less important to them, but the South was as important
                    in 1860 as in 1835. The railroads had not weaned the <geogName>Ohio
                    Valley</geogName> away from its connection with the South. "The people
                    of the <geogName>Ohio Valley</geogName> did not decide to fight the people of
                    the South so much because they had concluded that they could get along
                    economically without the south. … " Indeed, "they
                    believed that they could not get along without it." The Old Northwest
                    could not think of being divided between the North and South. It could not
                    become a part of either. Nor could it attempt to be independent of both. Only by
                    preserving the nation intact could it continue to use its three main avenues of
                    commerce. Early interference wit the trade of the <geogName>Mississippi
                    River</geogName> made easier its decision to deny the right of secession.
                    Because no other section had so much to lose by national disintegration, the Old
                    Northwest was the keystone of the arch of federal union.</p>
            <p>The work is written in a good clear style. The large amount of statistics make it
                    a little heavy in places, but it does not appear certain that they could be
                    relegated to footnotes or to appendices for they are an integral part of the
                    text. Documentation is quite adequate, but it is hardly a substitute for a
                    bibliography. The material has not been extensively used by historians and,
                    therefore, its presentation in bibliographical form would be all the more
                    welcome. It is doubtful whether the use of the term "Old West [pp. 129,
                    132, 146] conforms with the generally accepted understanding of the term.</p>
            <pb n="470" id="VAA4025-034-4-078"/>
            <p>All who are interested in the history of the Old Northwest and its place in the
                    Union will find this a stimulating book. Students of Southern history will find
                    in it furture understanding of the failure of the <geogName>Ohio
                    Valley</geogName> to continue its traditional attachment to the South. While it
                    is an important addition to the literature of sectionalism, its chief
                    significance lies in its explanation of the superiod strength of national unty
                    in the face of sectional division.</p>

            <p>A great southern element migrated to Indiana between 1800 and 1860, and readers
                    of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> are, therefore, much
                    interested in southern history. The Macmillan Company brought out last year the
                    first volume of a history of <hi rend="i">The Old South</hi> by William E. Dodd.
                    The author has long been a student and writer in the field of southern history.
                    The first volume, a book of over three hundred pages, covers the early colonial
                    period of the South, presenting the history of southern colonial developments to
                    1690. The second volume will deal with the South in the period from 1690 to
                    1754. Students of southern history will look forward eagerly to the completion
                    of the remaining volumes of this work by Professor Dodd.</p>
            <p>A <hi rend="i">Roster of Soldiers and Patriots of the American Revolution Buried
                        in Indiana</hi> was recently published by Indiana Daughters of the American
                    Revolution. The compiler and editor of the volume of Mrs. Roscoe C.
                    O'Byrne of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. Mrs. O'Byrne who was State Regent,
                    1931–1934, and Vice President General, 1934–1937, is now
                    Chairman of Roster. This well printed, handsomely bound book of more than four
                    hundred pages may be purchased from Mrs. O'Byrne at $2.00
                    per copy. The volume contains a "List of Revolutionary Soldiers and D.
                    A. R. Chapters in Counties" (pp. 9–31), and Records of
                    Revolutionary Soldiers" (pp. 33–395) buried in Indiana, by
                    counties. The "List" and "Records" make up
                    most of the book. In addition, a few pages are devoted to the "Col.
                    Archibald Lochry Massacree," to a "List of men whose service
                    has not been verified," to "Revolutionary Pensioners who later
                    transferred to other States," and to "Indiana Pensioners in
                    other Wars." The <pb n="471" id="VAA4025-034-4-079"/> volumes carried a
                    full-length picture of Mrs. O'Byrne, and another of Mrs. William H.
                    Schlosser, the present State Regent. It may not be worth mentioning, but it
                    seems that the title of the book should have included the word
                    "Other" before the word "Patriots." In the
                    last paragraph of the "Foreword," the compiler states that no
                    claim is made that the list as published is complete. She further indicates a
                    desire that additional names may be furnished by any one having knowledge of
                    soldiers not listed who were buried in Indiana. The volume should prove very
                    useful to many persons, and it will surely be widely used.</p>

                    treaties, the World became more and more distracted, and, as it was with the
                    soft head of the husband introduced by the Hoosier Poet, the World is distracted
                    still. To carry the analogy a bit further, the powers are not only
                    "that way yet" but they were "that way"
                    before the war started in 1914, or the plunge would not have been taken.</p>
            <p>A volume, <hi rend="i">Europe Since 1815,</hi> by Dr. Charles Downer Hazen,
                    appeared in 1909. At the close of the first printing of the book, the author
                    stopped with this sentence: "The historian, having reached the point of
                    interrogation, may in all comity, leave the answer to his question to the
                    prophet or the future." The following year, a few sentences were added,
                    in which the author set forth the situation as it was in 1910 with remarkable
                    accuracy. The supplementary sentences, so profoundly significant: read: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>Americans, generally, were stunned by the sudden outbreak of war. After all, very

                    people waited until we were in the conflict before their interest became real.
                    Then it was too late to study the background, and most Americans obtained a
                    "knowledge" of Europe that satisfied them in an incredibly
                    short space of time. The information acquired with such speed was inadequate,

                    feel sure that the masses of our people, both men and women, were glad that our
                    country had not been drawn into the whirlpool and remained hopeful that we might
                    be able to keep out. At the same time, there were elements that gradually became

            </p>
            <p>I had read enough history to know something of the force of war-time emotions,
                    but I did not at all foresee to what extent the people of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> would be overcome by the hysteria which our participation in the
                    great war brought on. The fundamental concept that only the truth matters, which
                    I had learned from inspiring teachers, had taken a deep hold on me. It had
                    indeed become a part of me, and I could not free myself from it even in the
                    midst of a war-torn world. I read and heard much, especially after 1917, that I
                    was sure was based on distorted information. There was little chance to combat
                    what was false in the propaganda that flooded our country, but I can say that I
                    did not at any time repeat any of it. I did, however, support the cause in which
                    we were enlisted in every way that I could. Further, I believe that it was
                    possible for me to understand the thinking and performance of those who so
                    readily became super-patriots better than they were able to understand my
                    attitude and manner of action and speech.</p>
            <p>There were those who profited greatly by the War in almost every community, and
                    likewise many that won prominence by their activities who might not have been
                    heard of otherwise. The patriotism of these classes arose from mixed motives.
                    The vast multitude of the people gained little in wealth or honors, but played
                    their parts with an unselfishness difficult to match in history. They made heavy
                    sacrifices without complaint, as long as they were called for, and rejoiced
                    deeply when the colossal struggle terminated.</p>

            <p>In spite of the World War, people had to go on living, and I shall attempt to
                    tell the story of my life as the stirring years from 1914 to 1920 passed into
                    history. At the opening of 1915, I was in the midst of my second year as head of
                    the department of American history and government in what is now the Indiana
                    State Teachers College. The institution was growing slowly but steadily and was,
                    in most departments, giving more attention to subject-matter and less to showing
                    students how to teach. The controlling thought for quite a few members of the
                    faculty had come to be that a teacher must first of all know
                    something—to give a specific illustration, that the first requisite
                    for a successful history teacher was to know some history. My classes were made
                    up of high school graduates and I found them able to do about the same quality
                    of work that was done by undergraduates in colleges and universities. I was in
                    love with my subject, I thoroughly enjoyed teaching, and I can say that my
                    remaining years in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> were happy enough.</p>
            <p>In the fall of 1914, I bought a small picture show in Greentown, Indiana. A
                    brother-in-law, William C. Myers, who had recently come from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cou">Colorado</region>
                    </placeName> Springs to Indiana, took charge of the enterprize. We called it the
                    "Star Theater," but, sadly enough, its purchase did not turn
                    out to be a good business venture. In fact, outgo exceeded income every week,
                    and, at the end of about three months, we closed down. Mr. and Mrs. Myers<hi rend="sup">6</hi> then came to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> to live for a few months, where the former was soon sought out by a
                    young man who was very anxious to trade some property for a picture show. The
                    deal was soon made, and I came into possession of a small house and lot in
                    Linton, Indiana, which was encumbered with a mortgage. It was rented to a good
                    tenant who paid $5.00 per month, while the building and loan payment
                    was $5.85 each month. This property, which I never saw, remained on
                    my hands but a short time.</p>

                    and half of it was too rough for cultivation, but it wasn't a mile
                    above sea-level, it was equipped with some pretty fair old buildings, and it
                    looked as if it could be redeemed. After a few months, I acquired this farm,
                    assuming the mortgage, and turning over to Mr. Myers a house and three lots, in
                    the village of Bringhurst, which I had purchased a few years before. Ernest L.

                    reasonable time, but the extra lot I owned for some years. It brought me no
                    income, while there was an outgo of forty dollars a year in taxes. Eventually, I
                    traded it for a small house and lot that was a good investment until the
                    depression came. Then it soon lost half of its value, and I was glad to turn it

                    "the way of the transgressor is hard," but whether I
                    transgressed or not, I know that my farming venture of 1915 started me down a
                    pretty rough road.</p>
            <p>I did not attempt to do much with the quarter section in <placeName>

                    </placeName> during 1916, but from March, 1918, to the end of 1919, I made an
                    attempt to accomplish something. During that period, I placed a fine, honest
                    man, who had once been a farmer, on the place and guaranteed him enough so that
                    he could afford to undertake the job of operating it for me.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> War-time prices were very high. We sold butter-fat at about fifty cents
                    a pound, wheat at $2.08 per bushel and hogs at more than
                    $15 per hundred weight.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> Everything that we
                    needed was purchased at a high figure and since we started during war-time, we
                    reaped no advantage. I bought some corn to feed on the farm for which I paid
                    $1.50 a bushel.</p>
            <p>Land prices boomed and Indiana farms with which I was well acquainted, and which
                    sold for less than $100 an acre in 1900, commanded from
                    $200 to $300 per acre in 1918. Farmers who owned good
                    farms before the war and who bought little equipment during the years of highly
                    inflated prices, reaped the advantages of the boom period. Others saw their
                    supposed gains melt rapidly away in the years of deflation that followed the
                    World War. For a vast number of farmers, there was little prosperity between
                    1919 and 1929.</p>
            <p>In the spring of 1916, a committee of the Normal School faculty was appointed to
                    prepare a program for December 11, the centennial anniversary of the admission
                    of Indiana into the Union. The committee was made up of Miss Rose Cox, Prof.
                    Frank S. Bogardus and myself. The headship of the committee was wished on me,

                    play composed of scenes representing Indiana in the pioneer period. In the fall
                    quarter, I selected the leading characters from the student body and the faculty
                    and drilled them from time to time for several weeks. In all, one hundred fifty
                    persons participated in this centennial drama. The play was presented three
                    times, on Friday night, December eighth, on the following night, and on Monday
                    night, December eleventh.</p>
            <p>The acts of the play included a pioneer home scene of 1816, rail-splitting scene,
                    a school scene, a corn-husking party and barn dance, a meeting of squatters, a
                    political meeting of 1840, a recruiting scene of 1861, and a home-coming at the
                    end of the war. Between acts, there were tableaux, which included: a conference
                    between Governor Harrison and Tecumseh; the boy, Abraham <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> reading by the light of the blazing wood in the fire-place; an
                    Indian girl; General Grant in the commander's tent; and Abraham <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> as President. At the corn-husking party and dance, there was a real
                    shock of corn to be husked; in the forest scene, a real log was split up with
                    mauls and wedges, and clap-boards were riven on the stage with a frow; at the
                    political gathering of 1840, there was an abundance of cider; in the recruiting
                    scene, a company marched away carrying old army muskets and wearing the uniform
                    of Union soldiers. The pioneer and his children introduced in the first act were
                    carried through the drama to the end giving a sort of unity to the whole, and a
                    supreme effort was made to have everything in keeping with the spirit and
                    customs of the period with nothing exaggerated. The staging of this indoor
                    historical drama was to me one of the superlative experiences of my life, though
                    I do not know how those who played parts in it or who saw any one of the
                    performances would think of it at this distance.</p>
            <p>It was on August 1, 1916, that I purchased a Model T Ford car. This
                    "machine," I had equipped with a speedometer, shock-absorbers,
                    and an extra hood that completely covered the brass band that adorned the front
                    of Ford radiators of early vintage. The car with appurtenances cost me
                    $455. I had insured my life in the Union Central Company of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1892 for $1000. This endowment policy was to mature
                    in March, 1917, and, anticipating the receipt of this sum, I spent nearly half
                    of it in advance for a Ford. When I acquired my next car in the spring of 1923,
                    our old "tin <pb n="479" id="VAA4025-034-4-087"/> Lizzie" was
                    disposed of for $85. When the new owner drove it away, it was still
                    "hitting on all four." How long it continued to give service,
                    I am unable to report as I never saw or heard of it again.</p>
            <p>When the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> entered the World War, I was past forty-five. I did not go away
                    from home to perform any kind of war work. I was a member of a local company
                    called the Liberty Guard which was formed early in 1918, and I drilled with this
                    unit weekly until I left <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> in June of that year. I made a number of four-minute speeches, I
                    tried to do my part in every drive, I performed my regular duties as a teacher
                    as well as I could, and I kept my head in the midst of war hysteria. I stood
                    steadfastly by a noble and scholarly colleague who was not re-employed at the
                    end of the year in June, 1918. In those tense days, this was not an easy course
                    to follow, but I have not a single regret and I would act just as I did, if I
                    were obliged to live through that year again.</p>
            <p>It was early in 1918, that the Ball Brothers of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>, having come into possession of the plant and grounds of a private
                    school located in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>, offered the property to the Board of Trustees of the State Normal
                    School. The buildings and real estate were to become the property of the state
                    of Indiana if accepted and used for a Normal School operated by state funds. The
                    offer was accepted. The new institution, first known as the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> Branch of the Indiana State Normal School, was opened on June 18,
                    1918, with a faculty of twenty. The school, under the management of the same
                    Board as the institution at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>, was also under the same President, William W. Parsons. The
                    resident head was Benjamin F. Moore, who left the superintendency of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> public schools to become Executive Dean. Several faculty members
                    were transferred from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> to be made heads of departments. The new history department was
                    assigned to me. I was not satisfied with the appelation "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> Branch" so I suggested to President Parsons that a better
                    and more dignified term would be "Eastern Division." This was
                    several weeks before the opening of the first session. I was advised to write to
                    Dean Moore, which I did. I found, however, that he was satisfied with the name
                    already adopted. After the school was in operation a few months, the
                    announcement came from the President that the Board <pb n="480" id="VAA4025-034-4-088"/> had officially changed the name to the Eastern
                    Division of the Indiaan State Normal and so it remained until it became the Ball
                    State Teachers College in 1923.</p>
            <p>The conditions prevailing in 1918 were not favorable to the opening of a state
                    school. The number of students attending during the first summer session was
                    satisfactory. It was in the fall quarter of 1918 that the skating had to be done
                    on such thin ice. With a few regular students for each class and an S. A. T. C.
                    unit, we managed to get by. The end of the War and the disappearance of the
                    military group, caused the enrollment of the winter quarter to be slender, but
                    there was a slight pick-up in the number of actual students. Quite a few more
                    students came in for the spring quarter, especially after the close of the
                    smaller high schools. The danger line was successfully passed by May, 1919, and
                    since then the institution has had a remarkable growth.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During the winter quarter of that first year of the Eastern Division of the State
                    Normal School, there came about a rather serious faculty quarrel. Fortunately,
                    it was kept quite closely within the faculty. A few of the really important
                    members of the teaching force who were quite intimate with Dean Moore during the
                    summer and early fall of 1918, became more and more critical of his policies and
                    methods as the months passed. Certain other members of the staff at once became
                    champions of the Dean, and by the opening of the winter quarter in January,
                    1919, the war was on. I soon learned that a faculty quarrel, like a wrangle
                    between two factions of a church congregation, can become quite a fight. I
                    don't yet know just what there was to split the worthy and ambitious
                    teachers of the young and struggling Normal School at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but a cleavage there surely was. It is something to smile about
                    now, but at the time it gave me much concern.</p>
            <p>By the time the trouble reached an alarming stage, I was convinced that the new
                    institution was destined to have a future and I was anxious that the prospects
                    should not be <list type="footnotes">

                            earnest faculty group in a new institution, when the outcome was as yet
                            uncertain, was that all of us learned to know each other well. Were I to
                            mention each member of that small group whom I should like to name, it
                            would be necessary to present the faculty list of the summer of 1918 and
                            the two years following. Several of them are still serving the school.

                            </placeName>, I was more closely associated with Prof. Otto B. Christy
                            than with any other member of the faculty. I should perhaps mention that
                            we played a few games of checkers in the summer of 1918, and that,
                            having found the game interesting, we occasionally staged other contests
                            as long as I remained on the faculty with him.</item>

                    those in both camps whose friendship I valued. Two or three members of each
                    group sought me out to voice their grievances and to ask my advice. At first, I
                    hoped to calm the troubled waters, but failed. Then I suggested that those on
                    the war-path make up a list of their grievances and remain as quiet as possible
                    to the end of the year, when the Board of Trustees could be asked to consider
                    the pleas of all and make such adjustments as the conditions might demand. The
                    furor increased, however, and Dean Moore became thoroughly discouraged. After a
                    time, he came to me for a conference, and I advised him to ask the Board for an
                    investigation. I pointed out that no other dignified course was open to him, and
                    that, whatever the outcome, it would surely improve the situation. He followed
                    my advice, and the Board selected a committee. Evidence was quietly gathered
                    from representatives of both sides and the middle, and a fair solution was
                    worked out.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> At any rate, conflict ceased and the members
                    of the teaching staff again devoted their talents to the work of the school. The
                    second year was one of considerable progress, and, by 1920, when Thomas J.
                        Breitwieser<hi rend="sup">14</hi> was made Dean of the school, the new
                    institution was on its feet with an assured place in the educational system of
                    the state.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was in the spring of 1920, that I was asked to serve as acting-professor of
                    history at Indiana University for the year 1920–1921. I obtained a
                    leave of absence and began my year's work in September. I had no
                    assurance that I should remain at the University at the time, but, after more
                    than eighteen years, I am still here, and hope to merit retention until the
                    hands of the clock point to the hour when my tenure is to end under our
                    retirement system.</p>
            <p>In 1916, I was a supporter of Woodrow Wilson as a candidate to succeed himself in
                    the presidency. I was impressed by his leadership, and convinced that the
                    legislation of his <list type="footnotes">
                  <item>

                            relieved of executive duties, but remained on the faculty as professor
                            of methods with, as I understood it then, no reduction in salary. He
                            continued as Dean of the school during the summer quarter of 1919.
                            During the fall quarter, several different members of the faculty were
                            successively placed in charge of the institution, each for two or three
                            weeks.</item>

                    him, but not because of the slogan, "He kept us out of war."
                    The claim has frequently been made that he was elected on the basis of this cry
                    and the belief that he would continue to oppose our entrance into the war, but I
                    do not believe this to be a true explanation of his election for a second term.
                    While the slogan, which has been so often mentioned, was used, there was no
                    issue between the President and Charles Evans Hughes in regard to the World War.
                    The reëlection of Wilson was really due to the fact that many
                    Progressives living west of the <placeName>

                    Preferring Wilson to Hughes, enough of them voted for the former to give him <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>

                    </placeName> which meant victory. The combined electoral vote of these two
                    states was twenty-three, exactly the difference between the totals given to the
                    two candidates. Wilson could have won by a margin of three without <placeName>

                    </placeName> gone to Hughes, the present Chief Justice would have gained the
                    presidency, shading his opponent by three electoral votes.</p>
            <p>On the night of the election, I stayed down town to watch the election returns
                    until eleven-thirty. It looked like a Hughes victory, but I went home feeling
                    uncertain. The morning paper announced a Republican triumph, which had been
                    conceded by eastern Democratic newspapers during the night. Looking over such
                    returns as were furnished from different states, I said to Mrs. Lynch as I left
                    the house— "The election is still in doubt." As I
                    crossed <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> Avenue, I purchased an "extra." The headline was
                    different from that in the regular morning edition, the latest returns
                    indicating that the West might decide the contest. In the end this proved to be
                    correct, voters in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>

            <p>Because the <placeName>

                    </placeName> soon entered the World War, it is not possible to say whether the
                    outcome in 1916 was a triumph for progressivism or not. We do know that during
                    the War, liberals tended to become conservatives and conservatives
                    reactionaries, and it cannot be denied that the general effect of the events of
                    1917–1918 was to check the progressive trend of American politics and
                    turn the current decidedly in the opposite direction. The effects of war can
                    seldom be forseen. Even to the victors may come unexpected results of far more
                    significance than the objectives sought.</p>

            <p>I understand full well that while writing about my experiences from early boyhood
                    to fifty, I have omitted much that could have been said. By giving more
                    attention to the raveled edges, I could easily have doubled the length of the
                    autobiography. Perhaps I may sometime rewrite the story and add some short
                    chapters covering the period since 1920, for, of course, the waters have
                    continued to flow under the bridge. I confess that I do feel an urge to write
                    some articles on special matters that I have touched but lightly.</p>

                    home.</p>
            <p>According to land records, Anthony Halberstadt entered land on January 20, 1806,
                    in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> County, Indiana. This consisted of 160 acres (N. E. Quar., Sec. 10,
                    Tp. 8, R. 2W.) The Mounds Hotel, three miles south of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, is located just across the Whitewater River from this
                    location. In 1813, Anthony Halberstadt sold 90 acres for $600 to John
                    Case. In June, 1813, he sold 50 acres to John Laforge for $140. On
                    March 6, 1816, he sold to Zachariah Cooksey, a Revolutionary soldier, buried
                    near the farm, the last 20 acres for $80.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                    Further records concerning this early family have not been found. It is believed
                    the family moved to a location near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> after 1816. Mary Halberstadt was married to Robert Buchanan in the

                    probability that the family did not make a long migration in 1816.</p>

                    </placeName>, with his parents in 1751. From there he migrated to <placeName>

                    </placeName> with the colonists led by Richard <placeName>

                    </placeName> in 1775, and came on to Indiana in 1811. His first marriage was to
                    Mary Shepherd, but the time and place are unknown. At an unknown time, he
                    married his second wife, Rachel Ryker (<hi rend="i">nee</hi> Demaree, widow of
                    Gerardus Ryker), in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. Ryker was killed in the battle of Floyd's Defeat on
                    September 15, 1781.</p>
            <p>John Vancleave was at Fort Boonesboro during the Indian siege of that station,
                    and he and his family were at Bryant's Station at the time it was
                    attacked by more than five hundred Indians under Simon Girty and some British
                    officers on August 16–19, 1782. It was during this attack that John
                    Vancleave, Jr., who was then about fifteen years old, distinguished himself by
                    shooting an Indian, who was standing on a high stump overlooking the Fort.</p>
            <p>About a year previous to the attack on Bryant's Station, John Vancleave
                    and his family were living at the station of his brother-in-law, Squire <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Boone</region>
                    </placeName>, Jr., who married Jane Vancleave (widow of—–
                    Cleft) in 1765 in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName>. The inhabitants of the Squire <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Boone</region>
                    </placeName> Station, becoming alarmed about the Indians in the country, decided
                    to remove to Fort Boonesboro for greater safety. They started on September 14,
                    1781. Squire <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Boone</region>
                    </placeName> was suffering from a gunshot wound inflicted by an Indian bullet,
                    and he, with his son Isaiah and a few others, remained behind to look after some
                    stock. The party had proceeded about ten miles, and were in the neighborhood of
                    Long Run, when they were attacked by the Indians.</p>
            <p>Mary Vancleave, wife of John, was carrying one of her twin daughters (Nancy), and
                    her oldest daughter, Rachel, was carrying the other twin (Sally). When attacked
                    by the Indians, they were in the maze of a great forest. Mary was killed and
                    Nancy was carried away. The other girls were taken prisoners, but Rachel still
                    clung to Sally, who <pb n="494" id="VAA4025-034-4-102"/> began to cry and fret.
                    The Indians were almost ready to kill the child, when a party of horsemen from
                    Boonesboro made a dash to the Indians and rescued the prisoners. The rest of the
                    family, it seems, had fled for their lives pursued by the savages. Nancy, who
                    was carried away by the Indians, was never seen again and her fate was never
                    learned. This Indian attack has since been known as the "Battle of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Boone</region>
                    </placeName>'s Defeat," although Squire <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Boone</region>
                    </placeName> was not present at the time.</p>
            <p>Two of the Vancleave boys, Aaron and Benjamin, were slender and fleet of foot, so
                    they made their escape by following the horsemen. John Vancleave, Jr., a fleshy
                    boy, could not run as fast as the others and was left behind. He made his escape
                    by crawling into a hollow log and remaining there all night. The next morning he
                    heard the scouts who were looking for the dead and came out of the log. He was
                    rejoiced to find friends and went with them to the Fort.</p>
            <p>When the two boys who escaped by running came to the river, the horsemen would
                    not take them up with them, so they caught hold of the horses' tails
                    and swam across. In that way they made their escape from the savages. After they
                    had crossed the river, they hurried along as fast as they could, encumbered as
                    they were by wet buckskin garments. Their pantaloons were watersoaked and heavy.
                    Soon they began to drag under foot, and retard their progress. One of them
                    rolled his pants up, and they were all right when they got dry, but the other
                    boy cut his off at the bottom, as they gave down and began to drag under foot.
                    When dry, they were too short and had to be thrown away.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What was left of the family got together again at Boonesboro. Mary, the wife of
                    John Vancleave, Sr., was found and buried beneath the branches of the forest
                    trees, but the location of her grave is not known. John Vancleave, Sr., and his
                    three brothers, Benjamin, Ralph, and William (Billy) settled on Bullskin Creek,
                    a small stream in <placeName>

            <p>Answer to Query 55 (March, 1938, p. 136, E.C.G.): From the information you give
                    in your query in regard to the Williams family, you must be a descendant. We
                    have the Frank Willing Leach Manuscripts, in which he has traced the descendants
                    of the signers of the Declaration of Independence. If we do not have your line,
                    we would like to have it in our files, as we want them as complete as possible.
                    From the Leach Papers, we find our dates slightly different from yours. The
                    dates we have for the children of William Williams, the signer, are: Solomon, b.
                    Jan. 5, 1772; Faith, b. Sept. 29, 1775; William Trumbull, b. March 2, 1777.

                        </placeName> Boruff (1857–1925). The statement that Valentine
                        Boruff died in 1856, aged eighty-two years, indicates that he was born in
                        1774. The Census of 1850, however, gives his age at that time as
                        seventy-three, which would make his birthdate 1777. The place of his birth
                        as given in the Census of 1850 was <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                        </placeName>. He died in Mercer County, <placeName>

                        </placeName>. His wife's name was Margaret (Mallicote?) Boruff. The
                        date of her birth is unknown; she died in 1842. Valentine and Margaret
                        Boruff came from <placeName>

                        </placeName>, and in 1841 they purchased a farm from the <placeName>
