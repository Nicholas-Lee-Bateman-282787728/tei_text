            <p>The Pogue's Run Valley may, for present purposes, be made to include the tracks and switches
                    of the Old Bee Line Railroad, now the Big Four, which ran down <placeName>

                    </placeName> Avenue, <placeName>

                    Street—and then diverged to the west to the camps north of St. Clair Street. At the point
                    of divergence was the old <placeName>

            <p>That we may not get into the realm of the "Veracious Chronicler" but stay in the
                    field of "unconsidered trifles," let us go back to one, if not the earliest, of
                    the recollections, involving as it does an act of kindness on the part of the writer's
                    father that grows in significance as the years throw their mellowing influence over the passions of
                    war. Confederate prisoners from Ft. Donelson were <hi rend="i">en route</hi> under guard to Camp
                    Morton. It appears that they were transferred from one train to another at the switch in the avenue
                    referred to above. When the transfer was completed, observed by childish eyes from the inside of the
                    high picket fence—How is it that through the intervening years one should remember that
                    the fence was painted dark brown, while important events of the same period are
                    forgotten?—one prisoner remained. He <list type="footnotes">

                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi> In the interest of local history, it may be recalled here that the
                            Peru Line main track, like the Bee Line tracks in the Avenue, was removed in later years to
                            the east and merged for traffic purpws with the Bee Line in the area now occupied by the Big
                            Four and the Monon.</item>

                    <pb n="84" id="VAA4025-027-2-002"/> was sick and feeble—too ill to walk and with no
                    ambition to escape. Him they placed against the switch stand, sitting on the ground and with no
                    guard. Forlorn and helpless he was. I can remember his ashen face, covered in part with brownish,
                    neglected whiskers. I know now that he must have been young. It was the custom of those days to
                    allow the whiskers to grow and photographs of youthful Civil War soldiers show mature visages that
                    we know were the faces of mere youths. Well, the picture in mind shows my father, a tall rather
                    severe looking man of sixty, opening the brown gate with the funny latch, carrying a pitcher of
                    buttermilk and a glass. Whether that sick boy in butternut clothes came from the cotton fields of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> or the hills of <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName>, whether from humble home or pretentious plantation mansion, it is certain that he was
                    no stranger to buttermilk. Eagerly as the gods might sip ambrosia, the weary one took the refreshing
                    drink, a smile of gratitude on his uplifted face. What fate was in store for this poor lad? Were the
                    prayers of a frenzied mother, far away, answered and did he once more see home and friends? Once I
                    finished the story in fancy, but in reality the one scene alone in this drama of the great war was
                    revealed to me. The rest is blotted out and beyond the ken of this life. Peace to the sick soldier
                    and peace to his mother waiting by the fireside for terrible news which she feared might come.</p>
            <p rend="center">PENDLETON PIKE</p>
            <p>The old dirt road that is now a paved street continuing <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> Avenue far out into suburban and country regions is still known as the Pendleton <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pike</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Where it crosses the railroad in the angle on the west side of the pike, in the early
                    days was a pond, and on the banks of the pond was a saw mill. From this point extending to the east
                    began a road that became Clifford Avenue and is now Tenth Street. This road saw much traffic for
                    those days of which we speak—traffic of boys going to Pogue's Run for the
                    amusements that all streams afford. Go with me down the Pendleton <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pike</settlement>
                    </placeName> and you shall still see Osage orange trees that once were part of the hedge, that
                    surrounded Fletcher's Meadow. It formed a triangle with the point at Pendleton <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pike</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Clifford Avenue and with its base lying northeastwardly nearly to the tile factory
                    (of which perhaps not a fragment can now be found). <pb n="85" id="VAA4025-027-2-003"/> Near the
                    tile factory was the old Swimmin' Hole in Pogue's Run. In this hole the big boys
                    taught the little how to swim by pitching them headlong from the bank into the deep pool where the
                    horny headed suckers used to take refuge from the noon day heat. John Coburn, nephew and namesake of
                    Congressman Coburn, was my instructor at this pool and my patron saint in other matters. If I could
                    find him I should relieve a guilty conscience by repaying him for a paper ten-cent piece that he was
                    credulous enough to advance on one necessitous circus day. (I wonder what the interest compounded on
                    ten cents for fifty years would be? But then those "shin plasters" were
                    depreciated currency and on that basis either the principal should be diminished or the interest
                    abated. So my remorse is somewhat assuaged!) Perhaps the noisy swimmers became such a nuisance that
                    the tile works people decided to drive them hence. At any rate it was spread abroad that broken
                    glass had been thrown into the pool and no lad durst thereafter go in there.</p>
            <p>Farther up the stream along where park boards have now laid unholy hands on nature were other water
                    holes of no mean fame. Off the banks under the white roots of the sycamores lurked the quick darting
                    sun fish and the sluggish cat. Now and then a red letter day brought a catch of a many finned dog
                    fish which called for murderous triumph. Up there somewhere in the ooze of the stream lie the rusty
                    remains of a once glorious nickeled four-barrelled pistol. It was not a revolver but a
                    "gun" with two parallel barrels in pairs. Never the like of it had been seen on
                    the commons where the "gang" congregated to lay out the day's adventures.
                    It was a sad home coming when all returned from a fishing expedition up-stream without the glorious
                    toy. It had cost me four dollars and no financial loss of later days has caused such calamitous
                    grief.</p>
            <p rend="center">MARK BROWN'S HOME RUN</p>
            <p>One day our baseball team traveled into a far country beyond Pogue's Run, where dwelt a
                    strange tribe of giant barbarians that were reputed to have defeated all teams from far and near,
                    and often enough added physical beatings to their victories. This writer (as Brisbane would say) was
                    on the casualty list that day, not playing because of numerous stone bruises on either heel, but he
                    limped to the battlefield and <pb n="86" id="VAA4025-027-2-004"/> witnessed one of the most telling
                    victories of that cycle. Creasy's <hi rend="i">Fifteen Decisive Battles</hi> had already
                    been written so this one, of course, could not figure in that list. It happened this way: The
                    "Belgii" in great contempt of the invaders, allowed "Mickey"
                    McCue—no boy's education is complete unless he has rubbed elbows with a
                    "Mickey"—to get to first on a short-stop error.
                    "Mickey" Shea and "Morry" Davis followed with hits. Long armed
                    Demarchus <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName>
               <hi rend="sup">2</hi> came to bat. He was a Goliath as he looms in memory. He must have
                    been eleven years old. There was a pond out beyond center field, which seemed to be far enough away
                    to be in another geographical zone. The batter smote the ball. It must have been the record hit of
                    those Babe Ruthless days. The ball rose higher and higher above all human reach. It sailed in the
                    blue ether toward yonder pool and finally dropped into its waters far from the banks and entirely
                    beyond the reach of the panting fielders who began to arrive one by one but who could only stand and
                    stare. Meantime the four runners had scored at the home plate. The ball was out in the lake. There
                    was no other ball—in those days no team ever had a second ball—and the game
                    perforce came to an end, with the visitors winners and the barbarians humiliated. The pond was long
                    ago filled up and traffic thunders over it. I wonder if some day when archaeologists are excavating
                    to find what manner of men inhabited this region—Oh well, if they do find the ball let
                    some other boy tell that story!</p>
            <p rend="center">THE GRUBBS BOY</p>
            <p>Out in that Ultima Thule, the Bee Line had built a mundhouse. To this <hi rend="i">terra
                    incognita</hi>, our wanderings brought us one day. One of my buddies, the Grubbs boy, about as big
                    as an airdale dog, and equally aggressive, climbed up into the cab of an engine in this roundhouse
                    bent on starting the big iron horse. He pulled with might and main at the throttle. Fearing death
                    and destruction and the terrors of the law, I pleaded with him to descend and flee the wrath to
                    come, but he would not until he found that he could not move the lever and that there was no steam
                    on anyway. So that threatened tragedy passed over our heads and we lived to become witnesses of
                    other things. I wonder what would have happened if the <list type="footnotes">

                    fiercely as he pursues a train or automobile. What would he do with it if he caught it?</p>
            <p rend="center">POGUE'S RUN ALL SUFFICIENT</p>
            <p>As I think of it now Pogue's Run was all sufficient. It provided fishing, swimming and
                    skating and its devotees rarely strayed off to the canal or to the more pretentious waters at Broad
                    Cut and the aqueduct. There was much more water in the stream then than now and exploring parties
                    sometimes went far up toward the headwaters though I do not know that anybody found them. The course
                    of the stream lay in deep woods and only in spots did the sun break through to dapple the waters.
                    Walnut and sycamore and oak with underbrush of haw and spice wood and pawpaw made up the glorious
                    jungle where a small boy could lose himself so easily and so happily.</p>
            <p>But a boy can always find or make a path even in the trackless woods, And how long is the path that
                    he makes? Even if one still be in the heyday of youth, he has traversed leagues upon leagues. What
                    good servants are a boy's two legs, whether short or long, even if the knees be
                    "knocked" and the feet cut and bruised. Using these vehicles we traveled one day
                    toward the source of the Run. The eldest of the Gang, Millard Davis, was privileged to carry fire
                    arms. The favorite shot gun of the period was the obsolete Civil War muzzle-loading musket to be had
                    from the Government's over-supply at four dollars. This gun, bored out, made a powerful
                    weapon that would carry shot in a compact mass to the top of the tallest tree and to the utter
                    destruction, when the aim was good, of squirrel or bird lurking there. It required a long iron
                    ramrod to drive home the charge or to clean out the barrel easily fouled with black powder. Millard
                    had one of these guns. Midday of the hunt, the ramrod became jammed in the barrel. The
                    "smaller fry" meantime squatted in the grass awaiting resumption of hostilities.
                    Did you ever see a bullet in flight? Tracer bullets are easily descried and I have heard soldiers
                    say that they have seen rolling cannon balls, half Gent, and sometimes shells in the air. Up to the
                    day of the big hunt, I had seen nothing of this sort. Millard could not get the ramrod out of the
                    barrel, Stuck fast deep in moist, smelly burnt pow'der, the iron shaft <pb n="88" id="VAA4025-027-2-006"/> could not be budged. Back of it was a charge of fresh powder, well
                    wadded. In a frenzy of impatience over the stubborn rod, Millard suddenly put a percussion cap on
                    the tube, put the gun to his shoulder, pulled the trigger! The gun did not burst but everything else
                    happened. The woods shuddered at the discharge. The ramrod, suddenly coming to life, leaped from the
                    barrel and sailed through the air clipping off boughs of trees and passing finally out of our sight
                    but still gaining momentum and rising into the tips of the trees of the forest. Millard was
                    "kicked" almost as far in the other direction, rolling down hill and crushing May
                    apples and spice wood in his rapid and unwilling flight, The gun without a ramrod was useless and
                    four disconsolate boys made their sad journey, infinitely lengthened, back to town. I have wondered,
                    too, what became of that ramrod, and whether some day it may not be found, like the arrow in an oak
                    and still unbroke.</p>
            <p rend="center">BRIGHTWOOD POOL</p>
            <p>A pool indented the earth up somewhere in the neighborhood of Brightwood. It was a deep black hole
                    alongside the Bee Line track. So far as I know, I was the Balboa of that miniature and peaceful sea.
                    How it was that I turned up there alone and with hook and line I do not now understand. It was miles
                    from home, but it paid. The pond was a natural aquarium. I no sooner dropped hook into water than a
                    deep tug showed results. Is there anything that gives such a thrill as a sure enough
                    "bite"? The pool was full of sunfish about as big as a hand—a small
                    boy's hand, probably—and my luck in pulling them out was so amazing that in a
                    mixed frenzy of fear and joy, like a poacher unapprehended but guilty, I fled home with my string of
                    fish, leaving I do not know how many hungry mouths unfed. No sign or trace of that paradise remains.
                    Perhaps I saved some of its denizens from an earthly grave.</p>

                    immediate vicinity, a gray brick as it is faintly recalled. In it lived the Hanna family. A real
                    historian or antiquarian could and would follow this clue and ascertain definite facts. The
                    tradition is that "old Mr. Hanna," whoever he may have been, was deaf. The first
                    tragedy of my youth was the death of this veteran on the railroad tracks nearby.</p>
            <p>I speak of him as "old". This is one of the prerogatives and errors of youth. One
                    of my children once cautioned me, stroking her long imaginary whiskers, not to "get old and
                    forty"! Some of you may remember Mr. Rust who was once principal of old No. 3 (or was it
                    No. 4?) school. The boys in that school called him "Old Rust". This was more than
                    fifty years ago. Twenty-five or thirty years later I met Mr. Rust, then engaged in business here in <placeName>

                    boys were calling him "Old Rust". So "old Mr. Hanna" may have
                    been young but childish minds envisioned him a decrepit Methuselah with the big wood-burner engine
                    creeping down and crushing him.</p>

            <p>From the beginning of the Civil War, President Lincoln assumed the power of ordering the military
                    authority to arrest persons suspected of treason. These persons were held in confinement without
                    regard to the constitutional right of the writ of <hi rend="i">habeas corpus.</hi> The civil courts
                    decided against this action but had no way of enforcing their decisions. By September, 1862,
                    opposition to the measures of the Government had reached such a point in the North that the
                    President issued a proclamation calling for the arrest and trial by military authority of persons
                    discouraging enlistment or opposing the draft. The privilege of <hi rend="i">habeas corpus</hi> was
                    withdrawn on the ground of military necessity. Many arrests were made. There was much popular
                    opposition to this policy and Congress took up the question. On March 3, 1863, an act was passed
                    sustaining the President for his arbitrary use of the military power in the matter of arrests, but
                    restricting his power for the future. During the debate on this measure Daniel W. Voorhees of
                    Indiana spoke in the following terms of the President's policy: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Sir, I challenge the worst ages of the profligate and corrupt despots <hi rend="i">for</hi> a
                            more <hi rend="i">intolerable picture of personal outrage than is here</hi> presented. In
                            prisons, in dungeons, in cells, in solitude, and desolation of heart, citizens of this free
                            country are threatened with increased punishment if they resort to the only possible mode of
                            approaching those in power to obtain information or trial with a view to liberty. Many new
                            offenses, unknown to the constitution and the laws have been created by the proclamation of
                            the executive; and to these it must be added that it is a crime for an innocent man,
                            overpowered by unlawful force, and wearing away his life in prison to employ counsel to
                            secure for him the benefit of the laws of the land. Sir, posterity will hold in remembrance
                            the authors of these outrages—The President and his cabinet—in order
                            to execrate the prostitution which they have made of their high offices to the overthrow of
                            the constitution. When they retire from their exalted positions,… let them spend
                            the evening of their days in pondering over the wretchedness they have so needlessly and
                            wantonly caused. Let them recall the tears of bitter grief, bereavement, and shame which
                            they have caused delicate and tender women to weep…. Let them visit the madhouse,
                            and listen to the shrieks and cries of their inmates, as they pour forth their wailhgs from
                            the shattered <pb n="92" id="VAA4025-027-2-010"/> dome of thought, and in that saddest sight
                            which earth can present—a mind in ruins—behold a portion of their
                            handiwork which will accompany their names into history. And if dreams come to them in their
                            slumbers, let them dream of the poor suicide, who communed in solitude with his sad heart
                            until his room became filled with shadows and impalpable forms, which mocked his agony and
                            despair, and who, to escape from his unlawful imprisonment, launched his naked soul into the
                            mysterious realms of the infinite and appeared for trial before a compassionate God. Let
                            them awaken to hear the heartbroken sobs of the widow, and the pitiful lamentations of the
                            fatherless. Let them make some atonement for the grief they have inflicted by looking into
                            all the detailed horrors which their system of infernal outrage has brought on unoffending

            <p>Who was this man Voorhees who thus violently denounced President Lincoln and his Cabinet for the
                    suspension of the precious writ and for other arbitrary actions? Can you picture in the
                    mind's eye a big man over six feet tall, thick chested, with massive frame, with fair hair
                    and beard, thirty-six years of age, at the very prime of life, defiantly facing a hostile majority
                    of members in the national House of Representatives and offering to them this scathing rebuke? It
                    was not the only time that Voorhees of western Indiana, in the midst of the grim and terrible
                    conflict, dared to offer caustic criticism of the administration of Lincoln and the majority party
                    in Congress. This attitude of opposition coupled with his great oratorical powers caused people to
                    ask, "Whence Comes he?"</p>
            <p>Daniel Wolsey Voorhees was born in <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Butler county</region>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

                    </placeName>, D. C., in 1897. The family, of Revolutionary stock, was caught in the westward rush of

                    </placeName>, Indiana, when Daniel was a mere babe. The father, Stephen Voorhees, was the son of

                    boy's experiences and landed at Indiana Asbury College, now DePauw University. Here he was
                    graduated in 1849. He made something of a reputation as an orator in his college days. It is of
                    record that his class mates and professors expected unusual things of him. Upon graduation he took
                    up the study of law at Craw-fordsvilla in the office of Lane and Wilson.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

                    </placeName> was then one of the most promising towns in western Indiana and there young Voorhees
                    chose to set out his shingle and undertake the practice of law. He came under the notice of the
                    ill-starred Edward A. Hannegan, also of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Covington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, who had already served two terms in the House and one term in the Senate of the
                    national Congress and who had the reputation of being one of the outstanding orators of the Nation.
                    Hannegan heard Voorhees deliver a Fourth of July speech and was so impressed with his ability as a
                    public speaker that he invited Voorhees to become his partner. Voorhees accepted and the connection
                    was made. In 1853 Voorhees was appointed prosecuting-attorney for the local Circuit Court by
                    Governor Joseph A. Wright.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> This marks the entrance of Voorhees into the field
                    of politics. While holding this office, in 1856, he received the Democratic nomination for Congress
                    and was beaten by two hundred thirty votes, after an intense and dramatic campaign, by James Wilson
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crawfordsville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. These two men stumped their district in a series of joint debates that in a very
                    curious fashion anticipated the battle of Lincoln and Douglas in the senatorial campaign of 1858.
                    The story of the campaign by Voorhees and Wilson is charmingly told by Henry Lane Wilson in the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> for June, 1928.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>

            <p>Voorhees, suffering the bitterness of defeat, was invited by Judge Elisha M. Huntington of the <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>

                    time of his death. His chosen field of action was the bar of the criminal court where he quickly
                    became eminent as a skilled and eloquent advocate.</p>
            <p>The break between Buchanan and Douglas over the Le-comptive Constitution was the occasion for
                    Voorhees receiving his first recognition from the Federal Government. At this time Alvin P. Hovey
                    was <placeName>

                    obnoxious to the Buchanan people that in 1858, Buchanan removed Hovey and appointed Voorhees as his
                    successor. This indicates that Voorhees was now being recognized as a leader of some importance in
                    the ranks of the Democratic Party of the state. In 1860 and again in 1862 he was <list type="footnotes">

                    successfully contested by Colonel Henry D. Washburn and the Republicans in Congress sent Mr.
                    Voorhees back home. This action took place on February 22, 1866, after Pres. Johnson had vetoed the
                    Freedmen's Bureau Bill. It was alleged that Thaddeus Stevens, then leader of the Radicals
                    in the House, informed Voorhees that this seat was necessary in order to give a two-thirds majority

                    following by Voorhees had been so bitter that it is not difficult to see why they picked him for the
                    sacrifice. In 1866 he was not a candidate, but in 1868 and 1870, he was successful. It is
                    interesting to note that the Grant electors received a majority of three hundred five votes in <placeName>

                    the position of their party in endorsing Greeley for President and stayed away from the polls. This
                    probably explains the defeat of Voorhees by General Morton C. Hunter.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> The
                    attitude of Voorhees toward a possible fusion of Democrats and Liberal Republicans was indicated
                    very early in a letter to his friend, J. C. Briggs, of <placeName>

            <p>From 1872 to 1876, Voorhees devoted himself to the practice of law in Teme Haute. It was during this
                    period that he made some of his most famous pleas as a criminal lawyer. In 1877 Oliver P. Morton, <placeName>

                    Voorhees completed Morton's term and continued to hold the office for the eighteen
                    succeeding years, being elected for three successive terms. It was his fortune to defeat Benjamin

            <p>Such, in outline, was the life of Daniel W. Voorhees. In his views on political and social questions
                    it must be admitted that he accurately represented the sentiments of the Indiana Democracy during
                    the war and during the period of reconstruction. His fear and dislike of the negro was only equaled
                    by his hatred of the abolitionist. In his famous defense of John E. Cook in connection with the
                    Harper's Ferry raid, [1859] Voorhees uncorked the vials of his wrath and poured their
                    contents upon the devoted heads of the abolitionists. Cook, a brother of Governor Ashbel P.
                    Willard's wife, but one of John Brown's followers, was wounded, captured, and held
                    for trial. Willard called upon Voorhees to defend Cook in the famous trial at <placeName>

                            to consider. Shall John E. Cook perish and the real criminals who for twenty years have
                            taught the principles on which he acted hear no voice from this spot? Shall this occasion

                            deadly and blighting as the poison of the Bohun Upas tree, from tongues of evil and
                            traitorous persons in that section of the union in which the prisoner belongs. They have
                            seduced not only his mind but many others. On the skirts of the leaders of
                            abolition-fanaticism in the North is every drop of blood shed in the conflict at
                            Harper's Ferry: on their souls rests the crime of murder for every life

                            which has engulfed him. They started the torrent which has borne him over the precipice.

                            is their act and not his. May the ghost of each victim to their doctrines of disunion and

            <p>With this soul-moving denunciation, Voorhees left the case to the jury. While old John Brown was
                    convicted of murder and treason, Cook was found guilty of murder only. Governor Wise of <placeName>

                    of Cook placed Voorhees in the front rank of special advocates at the bar of the country. The next
                    day he awoke to find himself famous. The fame thus secured has only enhanced in subsequent cases
                    such as the Mary Harris case, the Harry C. Black case, and the Edward T. Johnson case, until it may
                    truthfully be said that Voorhees stood without a peer in this species of forensic prowess.</p>
            <p>In considering the life and work of Voorhees, we must not lose sight of the fact that he represented
                    a district whose people were predominately of southern stock and sympathies. Most of his

                    state rights. Regarding inter-sectional disputes they believed that they should be settled on the
                    principle of compromise and they were deeply impressed with the doctrine of equality of all the
                    states. To all of this Voorhees most heartily subscribed. With sublime racial egotism, he asserted,
                    in his oration called "The American Citizen" that,<hi rend="sup">14</hi>
                    "Free government occupying the wholesome medium ground between anarchy and the licentious
                    violence of the unrestrained populace on the one hand and rigid tyranny on the other, has been aimed
                    at and sought after but never fully attained until the Anglo-Saxon race laid its hands on the
                    destiny of the world and became the champion of liberalized civilization." Then well-seated
                    on the back of his oratorical Pegasus he soared away in denunciation of that "false and
                    pernicious system of political ethics, which proclaims as its favorite dogma the unqualified
                    equality of the whole human family." True, he had a little trouble with the Declaration of
                    Independence but succeeded in evolving a "reasonable and sensible" construction of
                    that instrument which proved highly gratifying to an audience of slave-holders.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, Voorhees was opposed to abolition whenever enacted into law by Congress. In a Philippic
                    called the "Conscript Act" delivered on February 23, 1863, he let loose the reins
                    of passion and indulged his genius for denunciation to the full. He denounced the Republican party
                    for abolishing slavery in the Territories and in the District of <placeName>

            <p>He also commented caustically on Lincoln's lack of backbone and attributed the necessity of
                    the draft to the policy of abolition: "You purpose to put the black man along side of the
                    loyal white soldier. You purpose to buy negroes, steal negroes, fight for negroes, obtain negroes in
                    any way and then humiliate and disgrace the white soldier by his presence and contact in the
                    ranks." In order to make this burst of fervid rhetoric complete he accused the

                    making a threat of armed resistance to the government if it attempted to enforce the draft.<hi rend="sup">18</hi> Can anyone question the statement that Voorhees feared and distrusted the
                    negro and opposed emancipation with all his strength?</p>
            <p>In January, 1865, emancipation was before the House of Representatives in the form of the Thirteenth
                    Amendment. The proposed Amendment had passed the Senate in 1864, but had been defeated in the lower
                    branch. Voorhees watching the progress of the Union armies, had been driven by the iron logic of
                    events to admit that slavery was doomed. All through the struggle, he had been hoping that the
                    people would rise against Lincoln and repudiate his policy in the election of 1864. Instead of this
                    Lincoln and Johnson came through with two hundred and twelve electoral votes to twenty-one for
                    McClel-lan and Pendleton. This might not mean approval of Lincoln's plans for
                    reconstruction but it undoubtedly did mean that the voters intended to stand by him until the war
                    was ended. They were determined to save the Union.</p>
            <p>The reelection of Lincoln was the severest blow Voorhees had suffered. In a speech on January 9,

                    meant the overthrow of the institution of slavery and that now the blood and treasure of the country
                    was to be devoted to that purpose. Voorhees then tried to make the best of the situation by

            <p>Dr. James A. Woodburn, the honored President of our Historical Society, years ago prepared a study of
                    "Party Politics in Indiana During the Civil War."<hi rend="sup">20</hi> He put the
                    Democrats into three groups: first, War Democrats, or those who believed in a vigorous prosecution
                    of the war and who were ready to fuse with the Republicans in a Union party; second,
                    "Copperheads," or those who favored only a defensive war, opposed a war for the
                    Union, favored conciliation and compromise, sympathized with the South and were willing to commit
                    overt acts in order to slow up the war for the Union; third, Constitutional-Union Democrats, or
                    those who had favored concession, conciliation, and compromises in the years before the war. The
                    last group meant to save the Union by this means rather than by war but they would and did fight to
                    save the Union. While they abhorred a war to free the negro or to subjugate the South still they had
                    a deep and sincere devotion to the Union which led them in large numbers into the Union armies when
                    they saw that the question would not be settled by compromise and conciliation.</p>
            <p>Let those who doubt the utter loyalty of these people look at the table of enlistments given in
                    Professor Esarey's work on Indiana.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> Call the roll of the counties of
                    the state and you will find that the counties of the old seventh district maintained as high and in
                    many cases a higher proportion of enlistments according to population than the counties in the
                    northern half of the state. Though these thousands of Democrats did not desire to free the slaves
                    nor to subjugate the South, yet they shouldered arms and marched away to fight in
                    "Lincoln's war." They simply could not find it in their hearts to see the
                    Union destroyed. What a bitter choica was theirs! They must face the fact that the fruits of their
                    sufferings and wounds would surely be something they did not believe in, yet the Union must be
                    saved.</p>
            <p>Now, Voorhees can safely be classed in the third group, the Constitutional-Union Democrats, but it

                    he held that the war was unconstitutional in as much as it was being used as a means of coercing
                    sovereign states and of confiscating the property of the southern people. Hence, he claimed that the
                    Democratic party was trying to save the Constitution and that the war party was killing the
                    Constitution. He denied that his country was the physical continent that extended from <placeName>

                    proceeding contrary to the Constitution, namely, the war party. This theory of constitutionalism ran
                    through all of his speeches on the subject of the war and formed the basis of all of his opposition

                    claimed to stand, as the embattled champion of the farmer against the plutocratic forces of the
                    East. "The compensation to the farmer for the enormous and infernal taxes he has to pay

                    allusions and a sweep of historical knowledge that gave a finish and polish to them far beyond
                    anything attained by other speakers of the time. There was a free and impressive use of the bold
                    imagery that characterizes the formal oratory of an earlier day in American and English history. His
                    speeches in this respect remind one of the rounded periods of the elder Pitt and of Daniel Webster
                    at his best. Pathos, fire, glowing denunciation, all of the classic forms of appeal to the emotions
                    were used by him. Indeed, it must be said that his supreme power lay not in logical analysis nor in
                    close compact, formal presentation of fact but rather in his ability to reach into the human heart
                    and play upon its emotions at will.</p>

                    true representative of the Democracy of southern and western Indiana. In relation to slavery and the
                    war, his views were the views of many thousands of good men who wanted to see the Union saved from
                    destruction but were strongly opposed to the methods employed. This fact, added to his natural
                    oratorical powers made him a figure of importance in the forum of national af-affairs. It thus came
                    about that he came to be one of the spokesmen for the entire Union-Democracy of the north. The

                    The war to his way of thinking was unnecessary. It was supported in objectives and methods by a
                    majority to which Voorhees did not belong. In political theory, he was directly opposed to them and
                    hence found a place in the minority group. His great oratorical powers brought him to the front in
                    that group. Here, he energetically attacked, yes, savagely attacked, the methods of the majority in
                    carrying on the war. He felt that the Constitution still lived—that the war should be
                    prosecuted within its boundaries. He saw the majority pushing the powers of government far beyond
                    such boundaries and moving toward tyranny. He did not accept the Roman dictum, <hi rend="i">Inter
                        arma silent leges.</hi> In speaking out boldly in opposition he did much to maintain the
                    constitutional rights of the minority and to modify and restrain the majority in the exercise of its

                    passed since this autobiographical note appeared, the accumulated mass of literature about him now
                    surpasses that of any other man who has lived since the beginning of time, certain biblical
                    characters excepted. In that first biographical effort of forty-seven words only one of them was
                    used to summarize the status of his education at that time. The word
                    was—"defective".</p>
            <p>Inasmuch as four of the world's outstanding contributions to literature, the first Inaugural

                    </placeName> Address, the Bixby letter, and the second Inaugural Address, came from his pen within a
                    comparatively short space of time after he reported that his education was
                    "defective", it may be worth while to make a somewhat detailed study of one phase
                    of his early educational processes.</p>
            <p>Some light is thrown on the character of his Indiana schooling by a brief excerpt from another
                    biographical sketch that he prepared in 1859: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>There were some schools, so called, but no qualification was ever required of a teacher,
                            beyond "readin', writin', and cipherin'" to the
                            rule of three. If a straggler supposed to understand Latin happened to sojourn in the
                            neighborhood, he was looked upon as a wizard. There was absolutely nothing to excite
                            ambition for education. Of course when I came of age I did not know much. Still somehow, I
                            could read, write, and cipher to the rule of three, but that was all. I have not been to
                            school since. The little advance I now have upon this store of education, I have picked up
                            from time to time under the pressure of necessity<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Two statements with reference to his scholastic progress should be noted here. At the time he became
                    of age he says he did not know very much but could read, write, and cipher to the Rule of Three. In
                    referring to the knowledge he acquired between the time he became of age and his nomination for the
                    presidency, he writes that he made little advance during <list type="footnotes">

                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi> Sketch prepared for Jesse W. Fell, Dec. 20, 1869.</item>

                    <pb n="105" id="VAA4025-027-2-023"/> that period. We do know that between the ages of twenty-one and
                    fifty-one he succeeded in mastering a great many books which called for wide reading and
                    concentration. These books treated such subjects as the science of grammar, the theory and practice
                    of surveying, ancient history, natural law, biography, essays, drama, poetry, theology, law,
                    theories of government, and the mathematical problems presented in the six books of Euclid.</p>
            <p>Unless one is familiar with thq style of Lincoln's writings, he might conclude after reading
                    the above exhibits that there was something irregular about Lincoln's acquisition of
                    knowledge. The apparent lack of harmony in the statements of Lincoln and his actual accomplishments
                    is due to what we might term today an inferiority complex.</p>
            <p>When he was first asked to prepare a sketch of his life he quoted a line from Gray's <hi rend="i">Elegy</hi>, "The short and simple annals of the poor," and said that
                    best described it. After receiving the nomination for the presidency he wrote these words to a
                    friend, "Holding myself the humblest of all whose names were before the
                        convention."<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In all of his letters and speeches one observes the very humble estimate which Lincoln placed upon
                    his own ability. The tremendous store of information which he built up during his <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> years, couched in his own words, was but a "little advance" over that
                    gathered through the meagre opportunities of the early years. Thus his own humble appraisal of this
                    stock of knowledge gathered during these latter years may also indicate that by the time he was
                    twenty-one he knew considerably more than the alphabet and multiplication tables.</p>
            <p>About the time of Lincoln's nomination for the presidency he was urged to prepare another
                    autobiographical sketch. This appeared written in the third person and the following mention was
                    made of his Indiana school days: "While here Abraham went to A B C schools by littles, kept
                    successively by Andrew Crawford,—Swaney, and Azel W. Dorsey. He does not remember any

            <p>This sketch introduces us to the main theme of this paper, Lincoln's Hoosier schoolmasters.
                    A brief discussion of Abraham Lincoln's preliminary training will reveal the type of lad
                    with whom the first of these three Hoosier schoolmasters came in contact.</p>
            <p>We have the testimony of William Herndon to the effect that Abraham's mother was "a
                    ready reader," and what we have learned about the environment in which she was brought up
                    supports this fact. As there were but two children in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> home of the Lincoln's the mother had time to start her son in the most
                    elementary phases of his education. Possibly she should be considered as his first instructor.</p>
            <p>Closely associated with her as a teacher of the boy, and in a short time even supplanting her
                    efforts, was Sarah Lincoln, Abraham's sister, who was two years older than he. It is not
                    necessary to develop this phase of Lincoln's natural education. Anyone who is familiar with
                    child psychology, has observed the teaching methods at work in any family group of children. It is
                    not uncommon that younger children in the home assimilate the knowledge acquired by their older
                    brothers or sisters quite as readily as if the information had come to them through a formal course
                    of instruction. This was especially true where there were long recess periods extending over many
                    months between the terms of pioneer schools. Undoubtedly Abraham Lincoln's primary
                    education was stimulated by this sister two years older than himself, who not only accompanied him
                    to school, but also served as his unsalaried teacher at home. To her, more than any one else,
                    Abraham owed his early start in the field of knowledge. By the time he was seven years old, he had
                    attended two terms of school. It is doubtful if there were many children in the pioneer country who
                    had enjoyed so much formal instruction at so early an age.</p>
            <p>The most fruitless season in Lincoln's mental development must have been the four years in
                    southern Indiana between 1816 and 1820, when he was passing from seven to eleven years of age. The
                    removal of his parents into this community where there was no school, together with the death of his
                    mother during this period, disrupted any systematic plan for his instruction. During this interval
                    he acquired as much <pb n="107" id="VAA4025-027-2-025"/> knowledge as his sister was able to impart
                    so that she no longer could contribute much to his store of information.</p>
            <p>During the latter part of this barren four-year period, a youth by the name of Dennis Hanks, related
                    to Lincoln's mother, had taken up his residence in the Lincoln cabin. He was ten years
                    older than Abraham and although his education was limited he assisted the Lincoln children in their
                    self-assigned studies.</p>
            <p>Sometime before Christmas of the year 1819, Thomas Lincoln brought to the Indiana cabin a new mother
                    for the Lincoln orphans. He married the widow Johnston at Elizabeth-town, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, on December 2 of that year.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> While she was a good mother to
                    Abraham and encouraged his study habits, it cannot be said that she was superior, either
                    intellectually or spiritually, to Abraham's own mother. It is very doubtful if she could
                    write her name and she did not affiliate with a church until after her marriage to Thomas Lincoln.
                    Her own direct contribution to Abraham Lincoln's education must have hen negligible. The
                    three children of this widow, who came to make their home in the Lincoln cabin, were, however, real
                    contributors to Abraham's early educational efforts in Indiana. Elizabeth Johnston, the
                    oldest child was two years older than her step-brother and of the same age as his own sister.
                    Undoubtedly she had had the privilege of attending the Eliza-bethtown (<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>) Academy at different periods between the time she was five and twelve years of age.</p>
            <p>Elizabeth Johnston came under the instruction of at least one noted man, Duff Green, who taught at
                    this Academy from 1812 to 1816. One of his assistants was Rhodes <placeName>

                    </placeName> and may have been Elizabeth's first teacher. The successor to Green was
                    William Glascock. Aside from the regular primary courses taught in the school, Mr. Glascock offered
                    the following courses: "For the English language, grammatically, and use of the Globes,
                    Arithmetic, etc., $15.00. Geometry, Plain and Spherical Trigonometry with their
                    application to Surveying, Navigation, and Astronomy, Dialing, Gauging, etc. Algebra and Fluxions,

                    mathematics, she had a much better formal education than either Abraham Lincoln or his sister. That
                    they immediately began to appropriate what knowledge she had is an assured fact.</p>
            <p>It was the year after the arrival of the new mother and her children that Abraham's formal
                    schooling in Indiana began. The three children of Sarah Johnston and the two children of Thomas
                    Lincoln would be incentive enough to encourage some teacher to start a subscription school in the
                    Little Pigeon Creek community.</p>
            <p>Our modern school programs, built up around the needs of the individual child, are in exact contrast
                    to the pioneer schools which were guided entirely by the availability and qualifications of the
                    prospective teachers. As both the schoolmaster and pupils were restricted from school attendance
                    during periods when crops needed attention, or when the winter season became so severe that travel
                    was impossible, the school term usually simmered down to about a two-months session each year.</p>
            <p>Orphan children who were bound out were assured by court order that they would have at least a
                    year's schooling. This did not mean that they were to be sent to school some time during a
                    certain year, but that the aggregate of their schooling, during their apprenticeship should amount
                    to a year or the equivalent of six two-month terms.</p>
            <p>The school attendance of Abraham Lincoln in Indiana did not begin until the year 1820 when he was
                    eleven years old. His first Hoosier schoolmaster was Andrew Crawford, who taught what was known as a
                    subscription school. Crawford was not an itinerant teacher, but for some time had lived in the
                    Lincoln, community. We discover his name first in the columns of the <hi rend="i">Western Sun</hi>
                    as a justice of the peace of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Spencer county</region>
                    </placeName>, who on December 19, 1918, signed an estray notice. Jesse Hoskins, one of the neighbors
                    of Thomas Lincoln, father of Abraham, had "taken up" an estray horse, valued by
                    George Lee and William Hoskins at forty dollars, and Crawford had proceeded to advertise it.</p>
            <p>The fact that Crawford was the justice of the peace for Carter Township is proof enough that he had
                    some qualifications above the average pioneer. The thirty-eight closely <pb n="109" id="VAA4025-027-2-027"/> printed pages of laws in the published statutes of Indiana which set
                    forth the procedure for a justice of the peace, imply that it was necessary for Crawford to know
                    some law. Lincoln's first Hoosier school teacher may have influenced, unconsciously, the
                    choice of profession which the son of Thomas Lincoln made in after years.</p>
            <p>One of the chief functions of a justice of the peace in communities where preachers were not
                    available was the uniting of people in matrimony. In January 1819, Crawford married Joseph C. Wright
                    and Dinah Pierce. During the following two years he presided at a series of weddings in which the
                    Parkers, Gordons, Randalls, Angels, Turnhams, Syscons, Smiths, Hutchinsons, Masons, Zans, Joneses,
                    Thorps and La-mars, were the contracting parties. The last wedding he is known to have performed in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Spencer county</region>
                    </placeName> was on March 14, 1821, at which time Robert Angel and Polly Richardson were married.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> Crawford's name disappears from the records after the date of this
                    wedding so he probably left <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Spencer county</region>
                    </placeName> about this time. His removal in the spring of 1821 fixes the date of Abraham
                    Lincoln's first Hoosier schooling. It was in the midsummer of 1820, after the corn had been
                    laid by; in the early part of the winter of the same year, after the harvest had been gathered, this
                    term reachinp into the early part of 1821.</p>
            <p>Aside from the implications which may be drawn from Crawford's service as justice of the
                    peace little is known about his qualifications as a teacher. Examples of his handwriting indicate
                    that he was a good penman and traditions which have come down to us throw further light on his
                    teaching methods. He is said to have taught etiquette or "manners" as the subject
                    was then called, and he pursued this course by practical demonstrations. One of the pupils would be
                    asked to withdraw from the schoolroom and then re-enter, being received at the door by one of the
                    other members of the class. The guest was then escorted from bench to bench, by the pupil acting as
                    host, and introduced to each one present. Much has been made of Lincoln's appearance at
                    this time and a jocular rather than serious aspect has been given this valuable backwoods training.</p>
            <p>Another widely circulated story of an incident in the Crawford school is the famous spelling match,
                    in which Lincoln <list type="footnotes">

                    "defied." Katy Roby was asked to spell this word and continued as far as
                    "d-e-f" when she paused, not knowing whether to use a "y" or an
                    "i." Looking over toward Lincoln she saw him point his finger at his eye and
                    immediately took the hint, spelling the word correctly.</p>
            <p>It was at the Crawford school, also, where the teacher observed that one of a pair of antlers, which
                    had been fixed to the wall, was broken off. Upon inquiry as to who was responsible for this, Lincoln
                    immediately rose and explained that he did not intentionally break it but thought the antler would
                    hold his weight. He found out that it wouldn't. The teacher is said to have commended him
                    for his honesty.</p>
            <p>Possibly the greatest contribution which Andrew Crawford made to Abraham Lincoln was the placing in
                    his hands of a copy of Weems' <hi rend="i">Life of <placeName>

                    school teacher mentioned in the record above. It will be noted that Michael Swaney, the pioneer, was
                    dead by 1817, so that he can not be confused with the Swaney who taught Lincoln.</p>
            <p>James Swaney was born in the year 1800. After four years of apprenticeship, spent under the direction
                    of Dorsey, he evidently remained in the home of his benefactor and, while residing there, taught
                    school. We have evidence that Swaney became the teacher of Lincoln not earlier than 1822 and not
                    later than 1825. He was, therefore, during this period, between the ages of 22 and 25 but nine years

                    age was anywhere near his own. His school, like Crawford's, was probably a subscription
                    school.</p>
            <p>Swaney's preparation is set forth in the court record, which states that Dorsey should
                    "learn him to read, write and cypher through the single rule of three." This bears
                    out Lincoln's own testimony as to the qualifications of his early teachers. Swaney had at
                    least a horse and a fairly good suit of clothes at the expiration of his apprenticeship in the fall
                    of 1821, but there is no evidence that his father had left an estate in which he shared.</p>

                    twenty-three. If this was the land on which the school stood, the distance Abraham Lincoln had to
                    walk to reach it has not been exaggerated. It is two miles from the site of the Lincoln home to
                    where Gentry's store once stood, and Hoskins' place was at least two and one-half
                    miles to the south. Nicolay and Hay conclude that Lincoln had been attending this school but a brief
                    period when his father, feeling that there was too much waste of time, took him out and put him to
                    work. It is not likely that Abraham Lincoln was much the wiser from his contact with James Swaney.</p>
            <p>An act of the Indiana Legislature, approved January 31, 1824, provided for a more general development
                    of the school system. The last school Lincoln attended may be called a public school. Twenty
                    freeholders in a township could authorize the building of a school house. After the site had been
                    selected as near the center of the township as possible all freeholders over twenty-one years of age
                    were required to put in one day each week in the construction of the schoolhouse until it was
                    completed.</p>
            <p>The statute specified that all of the schoolhouses constructed under the direction of the school
                    trustees were to be "eight feet between the floors, and at least one foot from the surface
                    of the ground to the first floor, and finished in a manner calculated to render comfortable the
                    teacher and pupils."</p>
            <p>The prospective teacher of the public school was to be examined by the trustees "touching
                    his qualifications, and particularly as respects his knowledge of the English language, writing, and
                    arithmetic." His salary was to be provided by taxation based on the value of the improved
                    land in possession of the freeholders. The school was to be "forever open for <pb n="114" id="VAA4025-027-2-032"/> the education of all children within the district without
                        distinction."<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Azel Walter Dorsey was the only school teacher of Lincoln, as far as the writer can learn, who later
                    lived contemporaneously with him in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> country. When Lincoln prepared his autobiographical sketch for Scripps and named his
                    five school teachers successively, he named Dorsey last. The only personal reference in his sketch
                    relating to any one of the teachers was to the latter, of whom he said: "The family of Mr.
                    Dorsey now resides in Schuyler County, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>." The first information we learn about Dorsey, in the court records, is the
                    fact that he married Eleanor Spriggs in Nelson County, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>

                    Greenberry Dorsey went on a note payable to Abraham VanMatre, for the sum of $225. We
                    would infer that coming so close to the date of the wedding it had something to do with the
                    matrimonial venture. Whatever the need for the money, it is evident that the Dorseys did not meet
                    the payment when it came due in the following December, since it was in May of the next year before
                    any payments were made.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The year Abraham Lincoln was born, Azel Dorsey and Greenberry Dorsey, his brother, were farming a
                    piece of ground in Hardin County, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, close by the Mill Creek farm purchased by Thomas Lincoln. Dorsey must have been well
                    acquainted with Lincoln's father and his aunt, Mary Lincoln Brumfield. The Brumfields were
                    close neighbors of the Dorseys. During this same year, 1809, Azel Dorsey, George Burkheart, and
                    Greenberry Dorsey had rented some land from Michael Reuch on Clear Creek. The fate of the venture is
                    best told in the answer to the bill of the suit which Reuch brought to recover damages: <quote rend="blockquote">

                    affairs of the community. His good standing may have been responsible for his decision to enter the

            <p>As early as 1820, Dorsey began to purchase lots in Rock-port near where he then lived, but by March
                    seventh of the following year he had moved to an adjacent county, Dubois. The census for 1820 shows
                    him to have been a resident of <placeName>

                    age. Three sons under ten years of age and one boy between ten and sixteen are also listed. By May

            <p>Dorsey's qualifications to teach are evident as he was able to instruct James Swaney, a
                    former teacher of Lincoln. It may be accepted without doubt that Dorsey was by far the best-equipped
                    tutor of the two <placeName>

                    came in contact with the boy at a time when some advanced training in mathematics would be helpful
                    to him. When Lincoln became the pupil of Dorsey the latter was about forty-two years of age, as he
                    was born on November 5, 1784. Dorsey migrated to the <placeName>

            <p>The late J. B. Oakleaf contributed an article to the <hi rend="i">Journal of the <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Mr. Oakleaf was convinced that Dorsey was in the War of 1812 and that he received his
                    land grant in Schuyler County in recognition of that service. In 1840, Dorsey entered two tracts of
                    land in that county.<hi rend="sup">18</hi>

            <p>Mr. Oakleaf was successful in discovering the grave of Dorsey and on the tombstone the date of his
                    death was clearly inscribed as of September 13, 1868. The date of his death would not allow the
                    acceptance of the tradition which claims that Dorsey was living atl the time of Lincoln's
                    election to the presidency. It does not invalidate, however, his reminiscences as they relate to his
                    Indiana pupil, of whom Dorsey said: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>The main object of this paper has been to touch upon the qualifications of those who might have been
                    expected to influence Abraham Lincoln in his studies at home and at school in Indiana, with the
                    emphasis placed on his contacts with his Hoosier schoolmasters. There has been no attempt to present
                    the opportunities and advancement which were open to him through the availability of books and
                    newspapers. An account of his acquaintance with many of the distinguished men of the southern
                    Indiana country, and the influence exerted over him by lawyers, preachers, and other men in public
                    places has also been omitted. In other words this paper has not aspired to be an exhaustive study on
                    Lincoln's early aducation.</p>
            <p>Before this paper is brought to a close, one other incident should be mentioned which may serve as a
                    sequel to his formal schooling. The modern educational maxim, "There is no impression
                    without expression," found a fruitful field for fulfillment in Lincoln's own
                    experience. The fact that there were two children in the Lincoln cabin home younger than Abraham
                    invited the development of the expressional phase of his education which was responsible for the
                    lasting impressions of his early days. Lincoln on one occasion referred to this feature of his
                    training as one of the most valuable of all contributions to his early educational process. John
                    Daniel Johnston, step-brother of Abraham, and six years his junior, was the chief object of
                    Lincoln's expressional training. Daniel was a constant companion of Abraham, from 1820 to
                    1830. While Johnston was the main benefactor of this association, Lincoln's own improvement
                    was assured by putting his remarks in such simple language that his younger associate could
                    comprehend them.</p>
            <p>One of the best evidences of this cooperative educational venture, by which both Lincoln and
                    Johnston, profited is revealed in the part which they played in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> elections of 1831 and 1832, less than two years after they left the same cabin home in
                    the Hoosier state. Although Abraham Lincoln had been in the town of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">New Salem</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
               </placeName>, but a month he was asked to serve as a clerk of the election held on
                    August 1, 1831. The following year he was on the ticket himself as a candidate for the Legislature
                    from Sangamon County. Over in Coles County, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, at the presidential election of 1832, John D. Johnston, step-brother of Abraham
                    Lincoln, then but <pb n="118" id="VAA4025-027-2-036"/> seventeen years of age, was serving as clerk
                    of the election as the following entry of November 10, 1832, in the county order book reveals:
                    "Ordered that the treasury pay John D. Johnston or bearer the sum of sixty-two cents, for
                    serving as clerk of the last presidential election, out of money in the treasury not otherwise
                        appropriated."<hi rend="sup">19</hi> These two former inmates of the Indiana Lincoln
                    cabin, invited to serve in remunerative offices, because of their educational qualifications,
                    suggest a home atmosphere which must have been equal or even superior to the average cabin of the
                    pioneer country.</p>
            <p>When Abraham Lincoln stated that his education was defective he was comparing his early training with
                    the more advanced educational opportunities of 1859. When he wrote his autobiographical sketch that
                    the aggregate of his schooling would not amount to over one year, it should not be implied that his
                    educational facilities suffered by comparison with most of the other pioneer boys and girls of early
                    Indiana. His opportunities were only excelled by small groups of children who may have been living
                    in the few centers of population where academies were established. Abraham Lincoln may not have
                    known very much when he became of age, but there is plenty of evidence to show that he knew more
                    than most of his contemporaries not excluding his Hoosier schoolmasters.</p>

            <p>The political area of Indiana, known for many years as the "Burnt District" haa
                    been variously composed of from four to twenty counties in the eastern part of the state, Only two
                    counties, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fayette</region>
                    </placeName>, have constantly formed a part of this congressional district, with Union, Henry and
                    Rush counties included the greater portion of the time. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne county</region>
                    </placeName> has always been regarded as the hub, or center, perhaps because it was one of the first
                    counties settled. It contains Centreville, an important business, educational, social and political
                    stronghold. On the removal of the seat of justice to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>, that city forged ahead as one of the large and influential communities of the state.
                    The "Burnt District" has been, at different times, the third, the fourth, the
                    fifth and the sixth. It has been the sixth congressional district for the past sixty years.</p>
            <p>How the term "Burnt District" arose has been the subject of considerable curiosity.
                    According to Jacob P. Dunn, residents of the region of whom he sought an explanation were as much in
                    the dark as were other people. Mr. Dunn quotes a statement furnished to him by George W. Julian, who
                    represented the district in Congress for twelve years, giving an explanation which is accepted by
                    Dunn, though with a change of dates. Mr. Julian stated to Mr. Dunn that the district was first so
                    called in 1841, the Whig majority of that year having been so great that the Democratic leaders
                    applied to it the term frequently seen in the public prints describing a fire in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> which destroyed a considerable section of the city. Mr. Dunn found no record of a fire
                    in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1841, but did see accounts of a large fire there in 1845, and of one in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York City</region>
                    </placeName> also, he was inclined to think that Mr. Julian was mistaken in the date and that the
                    name "Burnt District" therefore harks back no farther than to 1845.</p>
            <p>So it might seem that the question was settled for all time, but one cannot be positive in such
                    matters: new evidence sometimes unexpectedly appears. Recently, when looking over an old scrap-book
                    kept by George W. Julian my eye fell <pb n="120" id="VAA4025-027-2-038"/> upon a page of manuscript,
                    evidently prepared in the eighteen-eighties, to the effect that the author of the term
                    "Burnt District" as applied to the region under consideration was Andrew Kennedy.
                    In 1841, this interesting man was elected as a Democrat over two Whig competitors, Jonathan McCarty
                    who had three times represented the district in Congress and Caleb B. Smith who was destined to
                    represent it three times later on. "AS it was found impracticable to get either of them out
                    of the way," says Mr. Julian, "the Democrats, on the eve of the election, secretly
                    brought out Andrew Kennedy of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware county</region>
                    </placeName>, which was then in the district, and as the Whig vote was nearly evenly divided,
                    Kennedy was elected. About this time a great fire in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> destroyed the best part of the city and the newspapers were filled with accounts of the
                    ‘Burnt District.’ Kennedy applied the term to his district, in which he said
                    Whiggery was as badly burnt out as Pitts-burg. This is the generally accepted origin of the phrase
                    since so well known." According to this testimony, it was <hi rend="i">Whigs</hi> who
                    suffered from the burning instead of Democrats, the time being 1841, when Kennedy was the victor.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The date of that fire still puzzles and perplexes, but for myself I am willing to waive further
                    investigation, consoled by the knowledge that at last we have found the real author of the
                    appellation "Burnt District." I am especially pleased to know that it was that

                        Globe</hi>, I find that these are Mr. Kennedy's words: "I came here with a
                    majority of fourteen hundred votes over one of the strongest men in my State. Yes, more: I have not
                    only succeeded by that majority over <hi rend="i">one</hi>, but over <hi rend="i">two</hi>, of the
                    most popular men of the State. And I have no doubt I could have beaten half a dozen just as
                    easy." Mr. Woolen also says that John Quincy Adams once congratulated Kennedy after one of
                    is fiery outbursts calling him the "greatest natural orator in America."</p>
            <p>Kennedy's election, in view of his ability and popularity, may have caused some uneasiness
                    among his Whig constituents, for by the next reapportionment, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware County</region>
                    </placeName> was taken out of the "Burnt District" and placed in one of three new
                    districts created in 1842. Kennedy was undoubtedly popular and a skillful politician, however, since
                    he was promptly elected from the district in which his county had been placed.</p>
            <p>It is interesting to note that only two Democrats besides Kennedy have ever been elected from the
                    "Burnt District," William S. Holman when the Republican party was still feeling
                    the effects of the Greeley exodus of 1872, and Finley H. Gray in 1912, as a result of the strength
                    of the Progressive party. Of the men who have represented the district in Congress, <placeName>

            <p>Among those who have served the district in Congress, a few outstanding figures may properly be
                    mentioned. Caleb B. Smith of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Connersville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, who succeeded Kennedy, was a native of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
               </placeName>, but
                    came West when a child. He had been active in Indiana politics for a number of years prior to his
                    first election to the national House, having served four terms in the state senate and as a Whig
                    presidential elector in 1840. An able man and strong partisan, he was regarded as an excellent
                    politician. Shortly before the expiration of his third and last term, he refused (though in his
                    seat) to vote for the abolition of the slave trade in the District of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, thus incurring the displeasure of antislavery men, <pb n="122" id="VAA4025-027-2-040"/> and was shortly afterward appointed Commissioner of Mexican Claims by President Taylor, as a
                    reward, it was said, for his silence at that time. He served for a short time as Secretary of the
                    Interior under President Lincoln, resigning to accept an appointment as Judge of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> District Court in Indiana.</p>
            <p>Smith expected his brother-in-law, Samuel W. Parker, also of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Connersville</settlement>
                    </placeName> and a lawyer, to succeed him as representative from the "Burnt
                    District," and this seemed the natural sequence. But the slavery question was steadily
                    challenging more and more attention. George W. Julian of Centreville, who had been elected to the
                    state Legislature in 1845 as a Whig but who had voted with the Democrats on two important matters
                    and had since gone as a delegate to the Freq Soil National Convention of 1848 at Buffalo, came
                    forward in 1849 as an avowed candidate for Smith's seat, though a Free Soiler. It was a
                    lively campaign, perhaps the most exciting that the "Burnt District" ever knew.
                    Parker boldly declared himself an enemy of slavery and made a strong fight, backed by Smith and
                    other leading Whigs both inside and outside the district. But Julian was victorious, largely because
                    the Democrats of the district placed no candidate in the field, most of them supporting the Free
                    Soiler, partly in recognition of his independent stand in the Legislature four years before, but
                    also because at this moment Democrats of the Old Northwest showed a strong tendency to take an
                    antislavery stand<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Two years later, however, after another bitter campaign,
                    Parker was elected over his more youthful competitor and was once reelected. He was a man of
                    ability, a regular in politics, as most representatives were. On his retirement from Congress, he
                    became president of the Whitewater Canal Company, the charter for which he had been influential in
                    securing from the Legislature. By the way, Parker was indirectly responsible for the brevity of
                    Andrew Kennedy's career as a blacksmith, according to Mr. Woollen. It seems that Mr. Parker
                    took delight in horses, especially spirited horses, and it was while blacksmith Kennedy was trying
                    to fit a shoe on one of Parker's most vicious animals that he received a kick that laid him
                    low for a long time. Parker naturally felt a particular interest in the case, encouraged Kennedy to

                    presently took him into his office as a student.</p>
            <p>Of all the men who represented the "Burnt District" in Congress, no one had so
                    stormy a career as Julian. This was largely due to his having embraoed the antislavery cause in the
                    days of its greatest unpopularity. For years, he felt it his duty to keep the issue prominently
                    before the people so as to build up and strengthen public opinion against slavery, and so gradually
                    force the extinction of the institution by restricting it to the states where it already existed.
                    When the war came on, he insisted that its cause was not state rights but the determination of
                    slaveholders to retain and perpetuate their peculiar institution, and he was for prosecuting the war
                    with every available weapon. The "Burnt District" contained many Quakers, who
                    naturally abhorred slavery. But there were very many settlers from the southern states who were not
                    Quakers, and he had these to educate and lead along. His task was not an easy one, and that he was
                    able to retain his hold throughout the war and reconstruction periods is remarkable, especially in
                    view of the hostility of Governor Morton and his powerful "cabal."
                    Julian's strength lay in moral suasion rather than in political maneuvres. Among the
                    schemes resorted to in order to compass his defeat was the familiar one of reapportionment. At one
                    time, he found three reliably Republican counties subtracted from the "Burnt
                    District" and four strongly Democratic counties added. Nothing daunted, he made a vigorous
                    campaign and was successful. But two years later, in 1870, he was snowed under and retired from
                    active political life.</p>
            <p>Another outstanding representative from the "Burnt Distritc" was the Hon. Henry U.
                    Johnson, son of Judge Nimrod H. Johnson and brother of Robert Underwood Johnson, who served four
                    terms, his last ending in 1899. Belonging to an old Republican family and steeped in the traditions
                    of the Civil War, he nevertheless did his own thinking, politically, and when he saw that the
                    country was being led into a war with <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName> over matters that he thought could be amicably adjusted, he boldly threw down the
                    gauntlet and denounced his party's recreancy in a spirited speech in the national House. Of
                    course, this meant the end of his political career. In his place, the "Burnt
                    District" elected James E. Watson, <pb n="124" id="VAA4025-027-2-042"/> a regular of the
                    regulars, who has been faithful in season and out of season to his party's behests. Mr.
                    Johnson, a lawyer still actively practicing his profession in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>, celebrated his eightieth birthday on October 28, 1930. By the way, he writes, while
                    this paper is being prepared, that his impression has always been that the term "Burnt
                    District" arose from the fact that certain persons, whether Whigs or Democrats he does not
                    remember, at one time burned their hats in their exultation over the defeat of their opponents at
                    the polls!</p>
            <p>The "Burnt District" has numerous claims to distinction aside from those mentioned.
                    One of the most famous Underground Railway stations in the entire country was located within its
                    borders, at <placeName>

                  <region type="county">Fountain City</region>, <region type="county">Wayne county</region>
               </placeName>. In Centreville, one is shown the old building where Gen.
                    A. E. Burnside, a man destined to an important command in the Civil War, had his tailor shop. I
                    believe that Joaquin Miller, the poet, was born in the "Burnt District," as was
                    James Whitcomb Riley, for <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Hancock county</region>
                    </placeName> was much of the time included therein. This district has furnished two Governors of the
                    State, Morton, the famous War Governor, and Isaac P. Gray. It has also produced two <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Senators, Oliver P. Morton and James E. Watson. It has stood high in the educational
                    world, the old Whitewater Academy having been located in Centreville, while Earlham College is at <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Time prevents the telling of other interesting features. I am informed that the term
                    "Burnt District" is no longer in use, but since every one of the eight counties in
                    the present sixth district, was a part of the old district at different times it seems a pity to
                    lose a designation so unique, with its romantic suggestion of a more exhilarating if not a loftier
                    period in the state's political history.</p>

                    shoulders, by reason of their faith and hardihood, we stand. Our reminiscent mood is the magic wand
                    that makes potent the wish expressed by the old McGuffey poet: <quote rend="blockquote">

                    just ahead which holds, perchance a grave or maybe our greatest success, our fancy wanders briefly
                    among the scenes of our early days.</p>
            <p>Our many minds turn in as many ways. What stands to the writer in lieu of a mind reverts to an old
                    brick homestead on the banks of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, just on the western outskirts of the little town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName> which was settled by the Swiss almost a century and a half ago. This old house, now
                    owned and occupied by the Postmaster, James Wright, and his wife, the latter a distant relative of
                    Mary Todd Lincoln and also a relative of Julia L. Dumont, the famous pioneer teacher of Edward
                    Eggleston, was built in 1817 by Jean Morerod, one of the original Swiss colonists. He married
                    Antoinette, sister of the Dufour brothers who founded the town.</p>
            <p>The old Morerod house was noted far and wide for its hospitality and many notables, including Henry
                    Clay and Jonathan Jennings have been entertained there. A few years ago, an old addition, known as
                    the ball-room, was torn away. Here, lighted by brass candelabra on the walls, were enacted many
                    lively scenes of pioneer days. It is said that half of the "matches" in the county
                    were made in this pioneer ballroom. Sentimental descendants have been known to come to gaze on the
                    scene where their fathers and mothers first met. The ball-room was on an upper floor and was reached
                        <pb n="126" id="VAA4025-027-2-044"/> by an outside stair in the foreign fashion. An old
                    wine-cellar below still contains two mammoth wine casks, one with a capacity of seven hundred
                    gallons and the other of five hundred gallons, believed to be the only relics now in existence of
                    the "chief product of New <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName> on the banks of the <placeName>

                    </placeName>."</p>
            <p>There was and is a brick floor in this cellar. It is said that old Jean Daniel Morerod, the builder,
                    took his oldest daughter there and showed her where he had taken up a part of the bricks and buried
                    his money, in case an unexpected Indian raid should put a period to his existence before he could
                    tell his family where he kept his secret hoard. He swore her to secrecy unless the emergency should
                    arrive. There is a place in the floor that looks as if the bricks had been removed which used to
                    pique my childish fancy.</p>
            <p>The house stands back from the highway and is surrounded by a well kept lawn, sprinkled with cedar
                    trees. It was on this lawn that the first orchard grass in the then so-called West, sprang up. Aime
                    Dufour, brother of Madam Morerod, too young to come to America with his older brothers and) sisters,
                    arrived in 1812, walking from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> and sleeping in barns <hi rend="i">en route.</hi> It is of interest that the vessel on
                    which he embarked was captured by a British cruiser and that he was detained for months. His sister
                    hung his clothes on a tree, like the careful housewife she was, and seeds of grass, souvenirs of his
                    wayside repose, fell from his pockets, took root and "bore an hundred fold."</p>
            <p>The site on which the old mansion stands is supposed to be near the spot where the oldest of the
                    Dufour brothers, John James, first landed when he came prospecting in 1801, after having searched
                    for a favorable location since coming to America in 1796. He sprang ashore and seizing an axe, cried
                    "I will cut down the first tree." He suited the action to the word, as was the way
                    with those sturdy old forbears. Yet it was a difficult undertaking—this pioneer
                    life—for those born and reared in a country dating its civilization back to the time of
                    the Caesars and who knew nothing about the use of the axe as American pioneers knew it. They had
                    been accustomed to many luxuries and too much can not be said of the courage and fortitude with
                    which they faced their hardships <pb n="127" id="VAA4025-027-2-045"/> and rose to the occasions that
                    confronted them that they might leave to us the heritage we now enjoy.</p>
            <p>The old house has been much modernized but originally it was of the colonial style. The walls are
                    over two feet thick and it contains many antiques of unusual interest. An old stoop adorns the front
                    entrance, and in true colonial style, a hall cuts the house in two, opening on a long back porch and
                    containing the customary stair leading to the upper floor.</p>
            <p>The old time parlor has its set of rose patterned furniture with a table made by the cabinet maker
                    Benjamin Detraz (pronounced da traw) who came from <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> in 1817. He married Lucy Morerod, one of the daughters of the house and the fifth white
                    child born in the county. She lived to be ninety-eight and was the source of much local history. She
                    was present at 'the birth of Edward Eggleston and put his first clothes on him.
                    "Twonnet" a character in Eggleston's "Roxy" was her
                    daughter who died in young womanhood very soon after her marriage to Harvey Titus.</p>
            <p>"Aunt Lucy" could remember hearing the cry of the panther on the hills at night as
                    a sort of lullaby when she and her little brothers and sisters were tucked in their trundle-beds.
                    She had seen the buffalo come down to the river to drink and a bear walking on his hind legs, carry
                    off a great porker from her father's pig pen. Her husband was the chief gunner in the Swiss
                    Artillery that went to <placeName>

                    second, and was deaf in one ear ever after." She loved to tell how <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> had said it was the greatest speed he had ever seen made in any

            <p>To return to the girlhood home of "Aunt Lucy", one of the first coal-oil lamps sold
                    in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName> is in the old parlor. There are handsome engravings of George and Martha <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and miniatures of Mary Lowe Dumont, wife of Peter Dumont, Revolutionary soldier, buried
                    in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName> cemetery. These were the great-grandmother and great-grandfather of Mrs. Wright, the
                    present owner. There is a picture of a vase of flowers, painted by Isabel Todd Dumont one hundred
                    and two years ago. She was a first cousin of Mary Todd Lincoln. A two hundred year old mirror
                    decorates the wall. Here the Julia L. Dumont Club, founded in 1886, started its forty-fifth <pb n="128" id="VAA4025-027-2-046"/> year of activity in September, 1930. The spacious lawn, once
                    used as a community center by the Swiss Association, echoed to the voices of one of the oldest
                    literary societies in the state of Indiana.</p>
            <p>Old Jean Daniel Morerod, the original owner, helped to haul Napoleon's cannon over the Alps
                    before the battle of Marengo. He was an eccentric old fellow as his unique will, recorded in the <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>, easily proves. In it, he provided that his burial should be of the simplest, that his
                    casket should not exceed two dollars in cost and that the difference in price "between this
                    equipage of mine and that usually afforded shall be spent in the best wine that may happen then to
                    be in my cellar and shall be dealt out to those who shall accompany my body to the grave."</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName> is full of just such houses. One needs but to scratch the surface anywhere about the
                    old town to get a rich find of romantic history, stranger and more piquant than fiction.</p>

            <p>An agreement has been effected between the Indiana Library and Historical Board and the Indiana
                    Historical Society by which the William Henry Smith Memorial Library is to be located in the future
                    State Library and Historical Building. It is expected that an earlier arrangement by which the
                    library was to go into the main building of the Indiana World War Memorial will be modified so that
                    a historical museum will be developed in the World War Memorial. The obvious adbantages of having
                    the manuscripts and books which the memorial library has, and will accumulate, in a building in
                    which a well organized library and a trained staff is operating make the agreement recently arrived
                    at very desirable.</p>
            <p>The William Henry Smith Memorial Library, bequeathed to the Society by the late Delavan Smith,
                    together with an endowment which after the payment of inheritance taxes amounted to
                    $120,000, has been in storage for five years pending the occupation of permanent quarters
                    by the Society. While at present it consists principally of standard works of literature and the
                    correspondence of William Henry Smith, father of Delavan Smith, the Society has the right to sell or
                    exchange books, and expects to develop a specialized historical library. The Smith Memorial Library
                    and the State Library will thus be mutually supplementary.</p>
            <p>The selection of a site and the construction of the State Library and Historical Building is
                    entrusted by law to a board of nine members, consisting of Arthur R. Baxter, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, chairman; Charles N. Thompson and William M. Taylor, also of <placeName>

            <pb n="130" id="VAA4025-027-2-048"/>
            <p>The Commission has selected the quarter-block at the southwest corner of Senate Avenue and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> Street and is in the midst of condemnation proceedings brought in order to clear the
                    title. According to the Act creating the Commission, the architect is to be selected by competition.
                    For the purchase of the site and the erection of the building, a tax of one-half of one cent on each
                    one hundred dollars of taxable property for each of the years 1929 and 1930 and a tax of one cent on
                    each one hundred dollars of taxable property for the year 1931 was levied. The Commission now [June,
                    19311 has available the first of these levies, or approximately $250,000. The whole
                    proceeds will not be available until January 1, 1933. It is planned, however, to publish a program
                    of competition as soon as the condemnation proceedings are completed which will probably be late in
                    July.</p>
            <p>The Society has already begun a few enterprises in the development of the library. Copies of maps in
                    certain French archives, duplicates of those secured for several other libraries in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, were purchased several years ago from Professor Louis C. Karpinski of the University
                    of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>. Photostats of seventeen letters of Judge Law in the Draper collection at
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
               </placeName>, were purchased last year. Before the building of the old
                    School for the Blind on the present World War Memorial site was torn down, detailed measurements and
                    drawings were made by an architect, and a book of measurements, drawings, and photographs has been
                    made from which the building could be reproduced. It was probably the best example of a public
                    edifice designed by Francis Costigan in the period before the Civil War. At the Centennial dinner of
                    the Indiana Historical, Society signatures of those present were secured on sheeta of parchment;
                    these with a list of the founders of the Society and other interesting material have been worked
                    into a "Golden Book" with lettering and illumination by Frederick Polley, When the
                    library is in its permanent quarters it will be in a position to add to its collection rare and
                    valuable items which should be preserved in the state but which would not come within the scope of
                    the other libraries.</p>
            <pb n="131" id="VAA4025-027-2-049"/>
            <p>The membership of the Society for the year 1930 reached a total of 1155, including six honorary and
                    ten life members. The present total membership, June 3, is 1053, including seven honorary and eleven
                    life members. The falling off of membership after the special occasion of the Centennial can be
                    avoided only by renewed efforts of our constituency to bring into the Society and keep in the
                    Society all of those who should be members. While membership is limited to those interested in
                    Indiana history and of good standing in their community, the number eligible is certainly much
                    greater than the present membership. The Society might well be enlarged to at least two thousand
                    without lowering in any respect the high character of membership which it has hitherto
                maintained.</p>

            <p>Dr. E. W. H. Beck served through the Civil War as a physician and surgeon. Earlier he saw service in
                    the Mexican War, following which he returned to his home in Delphi, Indiana, where he married Miss
                    Frances M. Milroy. Some letters written on the Mexican front by Doctor Beck, Robert and Samuel

                                    to see the Commissioners the 1st Dec &amp; I gave him an order for them to pay

                        <p>I received yours of the 22nd today…. You Speak of the victories everywhere
                                    else except here—Well—I have no doubt our Authorities have
                                    some doubt of trying them here—You see they have 1 line of fortifications
                                    behind annother for 16 miles deep—and 30 or 40 long—then
                                    protected by water &amp; mountains so you Cant flank them—McClellan

                                    would be a seige of from 1 week to a month to dislodge them—from their
                                    strongholds—for they have about 200,000 men—our Gov knows
                                    this—&amp; there would be thousands of lives lost &amp; should we
                                    be defeated—the jig is up—foreign nations would dictate the
                                    peace—Well—just the way we are doing will whip
                                    them—we are sending off Expeditions evry
                                    week—South—getting behind them—&amp; will in 2
                                    or 3 years whip them into submission—not sooner. I am sorry Tom Madden

                                    20. Why do you appologise to me—as if you bored me in long letters
                                    &amp;c—my God I wish I could read one every day from
                                    you—&amp; dont fail to write 2 or 3 a week if it dont tax you too
                                    much—&amp; I wouldnt care if they were a mile long—I
                                    devour evry word from you &amp; the children—I feel as much lost from
                                    [not] being at home as you can feel—indeed its punishment <pb n="135" id="VAA4025-027-2-053"/> to me—but, I thought it best and I must
                                    confess—while I am patriotic—I am after money and experience
                                    in surgery more—&amp; without these I should let the aspiring young
                                    men all get their fill ere I had left my little heaven of home…. Well
                                    Love I have no news—it has been so rainy &amp; muddy I keep
                                    close—in a few days I shall ask for that furlough—&amp;
                                    can't know the result till I try. Genl Hooker told our Col to day we should
                                    move in a week mud or no mud—this I don't believe unless we go
                                    by water—&amp; I hear of no expedition fitting out to take troops at
                                    this time. I think he talks so, just to stop or keep <hi rend="i">so very many</hi>
                                    from annoying or applying at Head Quarters for furloughs. If he knows we are going
                                    to move—Il not get off—if he dont know, hel let my application
                                    go to <placeName>

                                    Congress &amp; McClellan, I think he'l move wheather he is ready or
                                    not—but good heavens—it is raining yet—&amp;
                                    roads [are] so they Cant haul our tents or provisions or Cannon—so why
                                    should we attempt to go.</p>
                        <p>I may sell my horse tomorrow—I can get a horse that will do me for my gold
                                    watch—then I can send you a hundred dollars more home I cant tell for a
                                    day or two—but if I think there is a poor prospect of my going home Il
                                    send some money. But Frank you get out of Wm Cal-vert say 12 or 15 dollars every
                                    month <hi rend="i">Sure</hi> Cash you will have it—Show the money to Joel
                                    that it is on a good Bank—so he [Calvert] wont get behing too
                                    much—first thing you know he break &amp; owe you 50 or 75 dollars
                                    rent &amp; cant pay. See to this…. Get Juliens speech &amp; read
                                    it—its good—I wrote him a letter—congratulating him
                                    on the effort &amp; to get him to oppose a reduction of officers
                                    pay—I wrote also to Lane. I shall send &amp; have you express my big
                                    watch if I sell mine immediately.</p>

                                    when the order was first issued we were designed to go, but rumor has it to day that
                                    they have been fighting at <placeName>

                                    much to do—have been here a week to day—&amp; I hope tho

                                    that—altho he ought to have been thrown out—he cant do much

                                    </placeName> they will be disheartened. Oh, how it rains—evry man in Camp
                                    is asleep or stowed away to keep dry—not a sound is heard. &amp; we
                                    are right out in open fields—what was once farms are now

                                    ourselves—I dont want to get rich anymore, but make a mere good

                                    in—get Twenty five hundred dollars for it
                                    ($2500.00)—sell it—I cant buy a house in any other
                                    Town unless I sell that on—&amp; if I cant sell it—I cant
                                    well move—&amp; if I can I [might] try some other point. Enquire
                                    'round &amp; see if you cant sell it—the house is yours. The

                                    into any fighting &amp; all want, they scarcely know what. I am patiently
                                    waiting time [as] I am working for 6 dollars cash a day—for to further
                                    the interest of my family. Pay off those cursd mill debts &amp; get me a good

                                    Warrentown—Culpeper &amp; now last Tuesday noon we bring up at this
                                    Falmouth on the Rappan-hannock river on the bluff opposite Fredricksburg. We were
                                    hunting Jackson &amp; Ashby but took develish good care to keep out of their

                                    under yet. I most honestly believe they are traitors to our <pb n="138" id="VAA4025-027-2-056"/> cause, or else want to protract this war, for the money
                                    that's in it. Shield's Division was broken up at
                                    Mannassus—&amp; we transferred to Gen'l Rufus K King ([son

                                    Pope accomplished in the West, I am in hopes he will do some [th]ing. We drew 10

                                    here—they live fat &amp; saucey on the deserted farms; Business
                                    houses in towns are closed up, but Jews &amp; pedlers &amp; army hangers-on
                                    flock in &amp; make business whether or no—tho the people are very

                        <p>Our six Companies, 8 Regt. Infantry &amp; 8 pieces Artillery went out last
                                    Tuesday morning—in direction of Gordonsville, 14 miles from here, we
                                    being 1 mile in advance—we crossed a deep creek went up through a cut
                                    &amp; raided the Bluff in a strip of woods &amp; here about 400 yds to our
                                    left stood in line of Battle a Regt of Rebel Cavalry—they had Carbines
                                    &amp; commenced firing on us our Col got in line our Boys—we had no
                                    Carbines &amp; could not reach them with pistols,—I was in the rear
                                    and near my 2 horse Ambulance—I rode up to see the enemy &amp; turn
                                    back to turn the Ambulance back into the hollow—when they opened
                                    Artillery on us and Shells grape and canister came rattling over our
                                    heds—a shell burst within ten feet of me—knocked my horse back
                                    on his haunches—then I <hi rend="i">broke</hi> down the hill &amp;
                                    the whole Regt—was ordered down and on to the oposite
                                    bluff—but the Boys got alarmed &amp; such a scrambl[in]g &amp;
                                    skeedadaling you never saw—they followed us as full as the cut road would
                                    allow &amp; on the sides fired down on us &amp; Strange to say we had but
                                    one man seriously wounded—5 taken prisioners &amp; 1 of them got away
                                    from them—8 or 10 slightly injured—10 horses
                                    wounded—I killed—we killed two of them in the road coming down
                                    the hill certain—By the time we got up the hill—our men all
                                    saw 20 or 30 (week kneed) in line of Battle the Infantry came up &amp; our
                                    Artillery opened on them then you should have seen them skeedadle—next
                                    morning we persued 7 miles, &amp; to the house where our wounded man lay I
                                    mentioned. 2 weeks ago he gave our Gen'l some idea of their force &amp;
                                    that they were tolling US on with small force while their main body were getting in
                                    our rear on the Bolinggreen road—we wheeled around—came
                                    back—in the meantime Genl Gibbon a Dm squirt of a Brig Gen'l had
                                    sent back to town for reinforcements &amp; Genl Hatch with more troops and
                                    Artillery came out &amp; we gat within 1 mile of our old Camp &amp;
                                    Battleground of night before, Bang, Bang, went the Cannon—about 3 or 4000
                                    Rebel Cavalry &amp; 12 pieces artilry had got in our rear—Gibbons
                                    (our Genl) a lot of surgeons and myself were riding in a group, just behind the
                                    advanced guard—he was thunderstruck—looked
                                    pale—urged forward the Troops—our Cavalry went on ahead
                                    &amp; reported to <hi rend="i">Genl Hatch</hi> he was in our old Camp (they in
                                    his rear too) he ordered our Cav'ly to charge on the enemy—they
                                    had only 5 or 6 companies &amp; our men went in with a yell &amp; drawn
                                    Sabres—The rebels had arranged a trap by forming behind a deep &amp;
                                    terrible mudhole the entire width of the road our front ranks went down in this
                                    &amp; fell &amp; men &amp; horses piled ten feet high—we here
                                    lost 1 horse &amp; about <pb n="140" id="VAA4025-027-2-058"/> 20 men
                                    cripeled—our Col badly hurt in the side—but on the ballance
                                    went (after the said check), and they skeedadled &amp; we run them 8 miles when
                                    our horses were exhausted—all hands rested &amp; I think 500 men fell
                                    from the ranks of the Infantry sun struck or overcome, injured by
                                    heat—the enemy planted themselves again &amp; again our Cannon opened
                                    on them &amp; again we charged on them &amp; this time drove them about 5
                                    miles &amp; out of the way—here too they stood by beside a deep wide
                                    ditch &amp; had it covered over with brush &amp; the whole Regt. would have
                                    gone is as they did in the mud hole had not 2 or 3 horses outrun the ballance 20 or
                                    30 yards &amp; fell in, &amp; the rest seeing it checked up in time. They
                                    shot one of our men here thro the Brains (Carbine ball) he never knew what hurt
                                    him—we killed one of theirs here whose body we buried &amp; the
                                    Negrows told us the next day they had 80-110 killed &amp; wounded in their

                                    had 2-14 horse &amp; 1-2 horse ambulance &amp; I hauled all mine along
                                    &amp; lost none—tho we all got in yesterday evening but rear guard

                                    every available man is now sadling up their tired down and fagged out horses to go

                                    hot weather is so near. Burnsides is here &amp; in all about 30000

                                    carry—full one half the men are lost to active service—we were
                                    badly out Generaled—they beat us to death—but they had all

                                    &amp; fight the next. Col Carter showd a want of judgement—had no
                                    decision—disobeyed orders in going so far ahead of his Regt. did not heed
                                    what our advance guards said but bulged ahead—<hi rend="i">Great God</hi>
                                    Such Generals as we have it Seems as tho, our men had lost all Strategy, skill or

                                    scrap—The 2 Armies did not meet in full yesterday but each stood fast
                                    changing positions for advantages &amp; each getting up heavy
                                    reinforcements—3 Regts fought yesterday about 2 hours—Killing
                                    and wounding some—We all predict a terrible struggle to
                                    day—there might be 200 000 a side—I worked yesterday hard
                                    among the Wounded—I guess there are from 5 to 7 000 wounded—2
                                    000 Killed—O God how horrible is the Battlefield—to Day 20 000
                                    will fall if the Two Armies meet—&amp; McClellan is sure to move on

                        <p>I wish I could see you for an hour this morning. I could say much more than I can
                                    write &amp; I could swear this morning for an hour if that would do any

                                    have been fighting for fifteen days—our Cavalry against General Piquets

                                    evening we had general engagement of which you have outlines by paper

                                    service—Men tired and horses lame &amp; run down &amp; so I write
                                    a few minutes at a time as I can catch it—I have been over the Battle

                                    &amp; God grant you may never see the destruction of human life &amp; the
                                    human misery I have here witnessed. A week ago today we had a terrible battle at
                                    South Mountain &amp; I think taking great pains to approximate as near the facts
                                    as possible that we then had about 1000 killed and 2000 wounded—of the
                                    latter I think this is a low estimate and just about double of the rebels &amp;
                                    taking about 5000 prisioners. I may be far under the mark all around but the facts
                                    are so difficult to get at (the Battle front extending 7 miles) First reports so
                                    universally exaggerated that I come under even Genl McClellans first dispatch
                                    6000—in the loss of Rebels—Next morning early after our
                                    victory our Cavalry—we are in a Brigade of 2500 commanded by
                                    Gen'l Pleasanton (Directly under McClellan) who was formerly a Major of
                                    Cavalry in Regular Service—We were ordered in pursuit &amp; oh God
                                    how we slashed &amp; cut their rear guards—took several hundred
                                    prisioners—Strewed the road with killed &amp; wounded &amp; guns
                                    &amp; 4 cannons—the enemy took different roads—all toward
                                    the Potomac—panic stricken—leaving every superfluity that they
                                    could make the better race. Our loss in the race was about 50 killed &amp;
                                    wounded—Jacksons front (their Army extending 15 miles) had crossed the
                                    River &amp; now in consequence of the drubbing in the rear or drowning so many

                                    would prevent the impending bloodshed—A most terrible battle began ending
                                    with the darkness of night once more—Those who have been in all the

                                    have been bringing Rebels since yesterday morning (going over the ground &amp;
                                    gathering men &amp; interring first) they counted over 1800 laying in rows

                                    &amp; if we had a force of 100,000 as I believe we had—this
                                    percentage is not heavy—or about an average of the hardest fought
                                    battles—the Enemy for some cause or other suffered more 10 or 12, 000

                                    remembered mistake. Yesterday our colum Infantry &amp; Cavalry were ordered to
                                    cross the river. 10 pieces of artillery were placed on the bluff this side to cover
                                    our crossing—no Rebels could be seen—saw a few scattering
                                    piquets—Infantry &amp; Cavalry waded side by side—tho on
                                    the ridge of a Dam just above as many walked or waded. When one Regt. of Cavalry had
                                    crossed the rest were halted until 6 or 7 Regts of Infantry had
                                    crossed—the ballance of our Cavalry rested in the edge of the
                                    river—on the shore between river and Canal1 &amp; on the

                                    along the high Bluff &amp; cautiously ascended—a few Rebel piquets at
                                    first fired but soon as our entire force had gained the summit—10 times
                                    their number of Rebels swarmed in upon them forcing them [Union troops]
                                    back—pell me1l down the Bluff &amp; over the river as best they
                                    could—of course Our Artillery mowed them [Confederates]
                                    down—but they only slackened their pace &amp; did not stop until we
                                    were forced back over the <pb n="148" id="VAA4025-027-2-066"/> river—The
                                    Bulets rained over on the towpath. My squad ran into a Barn &amp; witnessed our
                                    Poor Boys droping on the Bluff &amp; in the river under the leaden
                                    hail—while all our Cavalry [came] back out at double
                                    quick—those that had crossed recrossing &amp; breaking for the rear.
                                    Today our Troops are deploying in different directions &amp; we only conjecture
                                    the future few hours—Hundreds bite their lips to day &amp; wonder at
                                    the singular polocy—the Astute Strategy of the failure or the
                                    feint—tho as I said before I will not criticize—untill we see
                                    whether as alleged, Heintzelman &amp; Seigle are on the other side &amp; are
                                    at this moment taking the Rebels Jackson and Lee into their traps &amp; securing
                                    what many believe could have been done on this side At least the citizens say on
                                    this side the river that the Rebel Army was in a perfect panic—perfectly
                                    disorganized—every man for himself—many drowning in the river
                                    &amp; that had we followed up our victory without waiting 24 or 36
                                    hours—we would have captured the larger part of if not the whole of their
                                    Army—but why did we not? Because they sent in an Armistice early on the
                                    morning of the 18 asking privilege to bury their dead—&amp; at noon
                                    annother truce to hunt for the body of Genl. Longstreet &amp; <hi rend="i">we
                                        allowed</hi> them to go all <hi rend="i">over</hi> our positions in search of
                                    what was nat—the Dead Body of their General—he was alive
                                    &amp; perhaps the very author of the infamous Strategy to find our Strength
                                    &amp; probable design—then, after burying but a very few—a
                                    ruse—they all left &amp; left us to care for their dead (they
                                    manifest very little care for either their dead or wounded) &amp; concluding it
                                    was not healthy to stand annother days fight Skeedadled in the hasty manner I have
                                    mentioned—might we, not have decimated them in following up our
                                    victory—or will you let the man you knock down rise &amp; get away?

                                    many a poor fellow quailed—the understanding wax thtt we were to charge a
                                    Battery—but one man only dodged under the Bridge &amp; one just as
                                    entering the narrow gorge, with his own pistol shot his own right index finger off
                                    &amp; turned back—I was immediately in the rear of the Lancers
                                    &amp; seeing him come bleeding to the rear—supposed him badly wounded
                                    &amp; went aside &amp; dressed the wound—&amp;thus escaped
                                    passing at the time this very undescribable hot place—they went thru with

                                    Skeedadled—When I came thru I counted 13 dead horses 4 laying together at
                                    the end of the Bridge—Our Cavalry separated in Regts ours going in a <pb n="149" id="VAA4025-027-2-067"/> ravine to the right—my squad taking
                                    refuge under the shed of a Bank barn of stone basement—" cannon
                                    ball entering the roof &amp; lodging in the grain while we were safe
                                    underneath—&amp; I am sure a thousand shot &amp; shell &amp;
                                    missles struck close around us,—in the road,—on the
                                    buildings—one passing thru the green blinds that were
                                    closed—of the elegant farmhouse across the road, making sad havoc among
                                    plastering &amp; furniture—the old farmer being in the
                                    cellar—the women folks gone—&amp; bounding against the
                                    solid rock of the bluff on the opposite side of the creek—Our Cannoniers
                                    now taking a nearer position &amp; right on the Bluff to cover the Federal
                                    advance up and down the creek belching forth their thunder &amp; the enemys guns
                                    replying the the shells giving a loud shriek as they burst—coupled with
                                    the incessant roar of musketry &amp; occasionally you could hear in the
                                    momentary interval the loud cheers of the charging party—made the scene
                                    wild—grand—&amp; intensely terrific. But I cannot tell you
                                    all &amp; must close by mentioning how my horse was shot. On Friday we gave
                                    Jacksons rearguard an unpleasant push into the river—Our Cavalry charging
                                    on them &amp; as the Boys Say hooping them over—I rode at least half
                                    mile in the rear—they riding fast—we passed [a] house about
                                    200 yds on where [on the roof] men were signalling—a cornfield lay 2 or
                                    300 yds to the left—Dr. Brusie &amp; all but 2 left me fop a moment
                                    &amp; went a few rods off the road to the right—I stoped turned my
                                    horses head toward them, &amp; looked back at the heavy Infantry column coming
                                    half mile in our rear—when a rifle cracked &amp; a ball struck my
                                    horse about 6 inches behind my sadle—entering under the
                                    skin—passing over the spine &amp; lodging, where it still remains
                                    near the opposite hip joint—Our man on the House with the signal saw 5 or
                                    6 Rebels run after shooting—a near cut toward a bend in the
                                    river—these were the enemys sharp shooters—remaining in the
                                    rear to Spy &amp; shoot Cc the [protecting] bend in the river favoring this
                                    &amp; our videttes failing to route them as they passed—</p>
                        <p>My horse is but slightly injured—I shall favor him a few days &amp;
                                    hope no such luck for the future—I had a showy new straw Hat on &amp;
                                    a finely appearing horse I suppose is why they selected me. The Signal officer came
                                    to the road to tell me &amp; the Col of the Infantry that just came
                                    up—that he saw the Rebel after he shot—&amp; their
                                    objective might have been to have picked him but the corn field was too far
                                    off—We rode on the river—our Cavalry there stood at least 20
                                    minutes under their shells concealing our Guns until ready then broke back into safe
                                    places—</p>
                        <p>I must close—I am in good health—tho dispirited that we lost
                                    our gains &amp; I am not alone in this—if we manage no better by Nov
                                    or Dec—I shall quit in disgust Give my love to all—let my wife

                                    Condemns S. for doing so little—the fact is from all I can
                                    learn—he might have done as much more—but he acted as if
                                    scared at every bush—<hi rend="i">Stonemam</hi> is in bad odor with
                                    Hooker &amp; the President—The fact is, all the Gen'ls are
                                    growelling thro each other—Poor little pusilanimous Pleasanton wants to
                                    Command the Army Corps—to have Stonemans place—&amp; he is
                                    about as fit for it as any <hi rend="i">2d</hi> Leutenant in the Command. I think
                                    Stoneman will be superceded—<hi rend="i">Anerd</hi> was—but
                                    being related to Gov. Curtiss—he had to be respected. &amp; so I
                                    learn is sent to a Western Command.—We Whipped the Rebs in the last fight
                                    [Chancellorsville] &amp; had we followed them it would have been a most complete
                                    victory—but as it, was, it was a defeat—so far as prestige is
                                    concerned. Out generaled—driven back—began when the 11th Army
                                    Corps &amp; part of the 12th had unloaded their Knapsacks &amp; overcoats in
                                    a pile—to get ready for the fight—so the enemy, drove them
                                    from &amp; held this ground—&amp; got about 20 or 30 000
                                    Knapsacks &amp; Coats—&amp; near 20 000 stand of
                                    arms—&amp; would have driven this wing of the army right into the
                                    river, but for Pleasanton getting his guns (12) &amp; stopping 12 of ennemys
                                    Guns—&amp; getting them in line &amp; belching away with grape
                                    &amp; cannister—4 it being dark (11 o'clk at night) they
                                    didnt know—but we had 10 000 infantry supporting—&amp; we
                                    hadnt a man [supporting] at the time—tho in half an hour—the
                                    3d Army Corps swung round &amp; checked effectually a further
                                    progress—&amp; this was Jackson's Army Massing itself on one
                                    of our weak pionts—&amp; here he got his death &amp; the fact is
                                    that his Command was almost distroyed.—His men were seen to come in a
                                    body up to our Cannon mouth &amp; pull their Hats down over their eyes and run
                                    bayonet in hand—right at our gunners—Our Dutchmen were scared

                                    000—Theirs about 18 000 to 20 000. They were glad to draw

                                    In fact Hooker Cant move forward now—He had about 100 000 before the

                        <p>Yours of the 31st ult. came last Monday. You seem to be satisfield if I am to have me
                                    remain from home till Oct 1864—Well, I wont do it—unless made
                                    to—I am not satisfied now—but feel it a
                                    duty—&amp; at the same time think the Cash I make is better than back
                                    account—for awhile—&amp; also that my stay will make an
                                    increase of my practice at home. I long for my good home &amp; to romp with my
                                    little ones—I love the associations of home &amp; feel that I am
                                    missing a great deal—yet, its all experience. No, I will never leave home
                                    again if I can help it after this adventure. I must get home this fall, if I can get
                                    out honorably—even tho. the war continues &amp; if Grant
                                    succeeds—&amp; the war declines—I will get out much
                                    sooner. I would like to be there for a fall practice, yet. I cant leave here unless
                                    the war declines—I still think <hi rend="i">Jim</hi> is right in thinking
                                    the war will close by <hi rend="i">midwinter.</hi> He said Vicksburg would fall in

                        <p>The only thing, troubles me, is to determine the <hi rend="i">best</hi> place to
                                    locate—I dont feel like the drudgery I must undergo at Delphi to get

                        <p>It is a week yesterday since I wrote you—I failed to get your letter last
                                    Sunday &amp; so put off writing till next day—as I had got
                                    Joel's letter on Sunday written the Sunday beforh—I looked for
                                    yours the next day—but the next day we were ordered off suddenly
                                    &amp; quickly—&amp; the whole Brigade moved down to
                                    Falmouth—Killpatricks Division who occupies that end of the
                                    line—had to run away down the <hi rend="i">neck</hi> along the
                                    river—Our fellows let the Rebs board them in the night &amp; take 2
                                    gun Boats from them—&amp; then a brigade crossed &amp; menaced
                                    our left—so Killpats whole Divis. sent them back Kiting &amp; we done

                                    miles from Catlette station. Our mails did not follow us nor the daily

                        <p>I am back from Division, to Brigade Hd. Qtrs. The Staff here is so much smaller

                                    much of this—hard work—hard living—blood &amp;
                                    suffering to look upon—I stay to do my duty untill my time is out or

                                    it.—We lost about 1000 Killed wounded &amp; missing in this
                                    trip—&amp; horses played out—So terrible to see evry time
                                    a poor horse would give out by sheer exhaustion—out with a pistol
                                    &amp; shoot him—break up the saddle &amp; walk on—A

                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>

            <p>Professor Helderman's study of origins of national and state banks was first submitted as a
                    doctor's thesis at the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>. There it won the favor of the history faculty. Subsequently it was submitted in the
                    Hart, Schaffner &amp; Marx Prize Essays competition and there won the favor of a committee of
                    distinguished economists. The volume is therefore unique in that it has been passed upon and
                    approved by both historians and economists. Mr. Helderman's work might very well come
                    within the purview of both groups for it covers a phase of American history which is of considerable
                    economic importance. The treatment is frankly historical but it is all the more valuable for this
                    very reason; the roots of our present financial structure are examined with care and in such a way
                    as to throw light upon the trend of development of our financial institutions.</p>
            <p>The scope of the work may be indicated by the words of the author for he points out that
                    "Secretary Chase, in recommending the National Banking System, said that his proposal was
                    not an ‘untried theory’, but that it was based on practical experience. This
                    volume covers, in the main, the experience which Chase had in mind." Thus the author has
                    made Chapter I cover the panic of 1837 in its international aspects, while Chapters 11-V are devoted
                    to the experience of selected states with banks and banking. Chapter VI considers the problem of
                    immediate origins of the National Banking System during the Civil War period, Chapter VII is a
                    summary of the origins of technical principles and Chapter VIII treats some of the later influence
                    of early state experience.</p>
            <p>In carrying on his research Professor Helderman has examined with care the primary sources from which
                    his work is largely drawn. But he admits that he has not examined all primary sources for
                    "several systems, notably those of <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>, <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
               </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mdu">Maryland</region>
                    </placeName>, are omitted;…" The volume does not purport to be a complete
                    history of antebellum state banking nor is it intended as a manual for the <pb n="165" id="VAA4025-027-2-083"/> practical banker, though doubtless many bankers will find its contents
                    of much practical value. But Professor Helderman appears to doubt the value of his work to
                    economists for "The economist in reading an historical dissertation frequently feels that
                    it is an antiquarian essay, bristling with formidable footnotes pointing toward and signifying
                    nothing. Many historians would not only concede the point but applaud it. But many monographs,
                    deadly as they are, must precede interpretation."</p>
            <p>It is true that this volume is well documented and this will, in the opinion of most economists who
                    study and teach economic history, add much to its value. Economists appear to be as fond of
                    documentation as are historians, and Propessor Helderman has performed a distinct service in
                    re-examining the original sources with a minute care which will give scholars a feeling of
                    confidence in his work. The writer cannot agree that many economists will consider this and similar
                    monographs "deadly". There is a very considerable group of economists both
                    teaching and investigating in the field of economic history which welcomes a contribution from
                    historians. Indeed, it is the feeling of the writer that economists in general will regard Professor
                    Helderman's work as a contribution.</p>
            <p>This volume traces with care the origins of the distinctive features which found their way into our
                    earliest banking institutions. The author has followed the main currents which account for our
                    present banking organization from the earliest beginnings down to the establishment of the National
                    Banking System. He makes it clear that our present system is composed of elements taken from a
                    variety of sources. "Under the lash of economic distress (following the panic of 1837) two
                    clear tendencies emerged: one, a reform movement: the other, a sharp anti-bank reaction."
                    Out of the reform movement came the free banking system of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> and this, as perfected and imitated by other states, became the model of the National
                    system. Both the reform movement and the anti-bank movement are traced in such a way as to show
                    their contribution to the present banking system. But Professor Helderman does not attempt to
                    appraise these contributions. Rather, he confines himself to the business of historical anslysis.
                    Thus one is left to determine for himself whether the impingement of democracy upon the Safety-Fund
                    System with <pb n="166" id="VAA4025-027-2-084"/> the resulting Free Banking System is a good or bad
                    thing from a social point of view. In any event it is evident that the great stirrings of democracy
                    of the Jacksonian era gave our banking structure a twist from which it has not yet <hi rend="i">recovered</hi>, shall one say?</p>
            <p>The politicians of various states found the free banking system a convenient device. (a) It could be
                    made the basis of an appeal to the masses, who were only a little more ignorant of economic
                    principles than they themselves, disguised as an attack upon monopoly and (b) it could be made the
                    means of providing a market for state bonds the proceeds of which could be used for public works. At
                    any rate examination of the source material which still survives in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> indicates that the introduction of free banking into <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, if not in other states, can partly be accounted for in this manner. Professor
                    Helderman's work makes it quite clear that when democracy and sound economic policy come
                    into contact, the latter is more than likely to be modified. The masses won the victory against
                    monopoly—against banks created by special charters—but they delayed the
                    establishment of an adequate banking system until 1913. On the other hand, a market for questionable
                    state bonds was found and the "friends" of the people profited greatly through the
                    so-called public works. Out of the mess there arose some excellent banking systems—in
                    Indiana, <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>, <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
               </placeName> and elsewhere from which certain features, permanently
                    valuable, emerged. Thus it may be said that, in a sense, democracy muddled through.</p>
            <p>If one were looking for a sub-title for this study "An analysis of the experience of a
                    democratic society in its efforts to fathom the economics of banking and bank-note
                    currency" might be suggested. The fruit of the effort to adapt democratic conceptions to
                    banking practice is, according to Professor Helderman, the National Banking System. The latter, he
                    holds, "will be seen to emerge from the experience covered". In this contention he
                    is correct and his work makes it evident that the National Banking System was the main stream into
                    which many small ones poured their contributions. These small streams have been examined with care
                    and their relation to the final result is clearly established. Thus we have at present one national
                    banking system and forty-eight state systems with independent unit banks as the main though not
                    exclusive <pb n="167" id="VAA4025-027-2-085"/> characteristic. The power of concentrated wealth was
                    diluted at least for a time; this was the result of the impingement of democratic forces upon
                    economic forces. Thus we have the essential nature of the study.</p>
            <p>It is evident that there can be no clear understanding of the present banking situation with its
                    clash between forces making for the continuance of a democratic system and those which look to
                    greater concentration of power without careful consideration of the work which Professor Helderman
                    has done.</p>

            <p>For many years Clarence M. Burton has devoted time and money to the accumulation of a mass of books,
                    other printed records and manuscripts pertaining to the history of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>. When it was determined to take up the task of publishing the manuscripts in the
                    extensive and valuable Burton Collection, the Directors of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> Public Library decided to begin with the <hi rend="i">John Askin Papers.</hi> The first
                    volume appeared in 1928, being also the first in a series known as the <hi rend="i">Bzirton
                        Historical Records.</hi> A brief review of volume I appeared in this quarterly in June, 1928.
                    Attention was then called to the durable quality of the handsome volume and to the fine
                    craftman-ship and general excellence of its make-up. In this respect, the new volume, which
                    completes the <hi rend="i">Askin Papers</hi>, duplicates the fine qualities of Volume I. The earlier
                    volume includes documents falling within the years 1747-1795. The present volume presents those of
                    Askin's later career, the period embracing the years 1796-1820.</p>
            <p>The letters of Askin and his correspondents published in the two large volumes furnish a vast amount
                    of original information relative to the history of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Indeed the great array of course matter presented places all students of the history
                    of the Old Northwest and of the states formed from that area under deep obligations to Dr. Quaife
                    and the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> Public Library. While the letters vary much in content, throwing light on a multitude
                    of things related to the period, they furnish extensive information in regard to the business
                    activities <pb n="168" id="VAA4025-027-2-086"/> of the times. Almost every document in the two
                    volumes possesses historical value. Many of the letters are fascinating in their human interest and
                    may be read for pure enjoyment.</p>
            <p>The editing has been done with meticulous care. Anyone accustomed to the preparation of manuscripts
                    for the printer knows that Dr. Quaife and his <hi rend="i">aides</hi> have performed a stupendous
                    piece of work. Beyond question, the task has been well executed. It has been the desire of the
                    editor and the printers of the <hi rend="i">Askin Pupers</hi> to produce "books worthy of
                    bearing the imprint of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> Public Library." The two volumes published are tangible evidence that they
                    have succeeded in fullfilling that desire.</p>

                    definite attempt to carry out the purpose of the book. Among the best of these chapters are:
                    "The Waterway Keys to our Soil Provinces"; "Highland Pathways of Conquest
                    and Migration"; "The Meadows of New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>"; "The Tidewater Pioneers"; "The <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> Piedmont"; "The Grand Advance"; "Beyond the
                    Shenandoah"; "The Conquest of the Alleghanies"; "The Blue Grass
                    Region."</p>
            <p>Though the title is <hi rend="i">Soil</hi>, the voulme is as much a study of the effects of
                    topography on American history as it is of the influence of soils. In fact, the study is what it
                    should be, an analysis of geographic influences with more than the customary <pb n="169" id="VAA4025-027-2-087"/> space devoted to soil as a determining factor in the history of the
                    country.</p>
            <p>There is too much rambling and lack of organization within many of the chapters, but in general the
                    content is very good. The pages of the volume abound in sane conclusions and illuminating comments.
                    We are told (p. 53) that, "The student of American history who becomes acquainted with the
                    uplands of his neighborhood, is in the way not only of understanding better just how population
                    advanced and was distributed, but is likely to assay other factors of geography, of soils, forests
                    and vegetation as he never would otherwise." The great influence exerted by the <hi rend="i">meadows</hi> of New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> is fully portrayed. "These rugged states of New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> must be seen in the light of these innumerable spots of vivid green" declares
                    the author (p. 105). By a sure hand, the reader has pointed out to him the many ways in which the
                    economic, social and political life of New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> was affected by the "diminutive meadows" of that section.</p>
            <p>In regard to the Old Dominion, it is asserted that "Beyond anything known in New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, the history of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> is the history of her soil" (p. 109). The "garden spot of the Middle
                    West" is found in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, concerning which area we have the statement (p. 187) that, "It would be
                    difficult to overestimate the influence of the <hi rend="i">Blue</hi> Grass Region <hi rend="i">of</hi>
                    <placeName>

                    </placeName> on American expansion and Republic building."</p>
            <p>The chapters dealing with mountain areas and drainage systems would be greatly improved if
                    accompanied by a few good maps. A reader not'thoroughly acquainted with the geography of
                    the Southern Appalachians will have a difficult time when reading chapters three, four, five and
                    seventeen. In some cases, it seems to the reviewer that the author himself is confused. Speaking of
                    the <hi rend="i">divide</hi> between the New River and the sources of the <geogName>Virginia
                    rivers</geogName> that feed the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> system, Dr. Hurlburt says (p. 45)/of this elevation: "Those highlands are in
                    reality the summit of the Alleghenies, but so gradual is the rise that riding swiftly by train or
                    automobile one hardly realizes the mountain barrier is being crossed; this is the ‘South
                    Pass of the Rockies’ over the Alleghenies." The question which we raise here is,
                    whether the divide mentioned has been, or can be, called a part of the Allegheny escarpment by any
                    geographer? Rather it seems to be merely <pb n="170" id="VAA4025-027-2-088"/> a higher portion of
                    the Appalachian Valley stretching southeastward from the Alleghenies parallel to the New and above
                    the sources of the forks of the Holston. Is it not instead of a pass, simply a moderate barrier
                    lying across the trough of the Appalachians?</p>
            <p>Truly, Professor Hulbert has taken up the study of a fruitful theme. His volume makes a real
                    contribution, though, as he realizes, it is but a beginning. History is the product of many forces,
                    and it is impossible to correctly narrate or interpret the development of any people or country
                    without giving consideration to each of the essential factors. It is well that the fundamental
                    importance of <hi rend="i">soil</hi> has been so clearly and fully set forth.</p>

            <p>The author of this book, perhaps unconsciously, carried out two purposes: one to present to her
                    readers an edifying account of a holy and devout churchman; the other to give a detailed and
                    accurate biography of a historical character. Bishop Bruté lends himself admirably to
                    either purpose. He was a "man of God," energetic in every good work, denying
                    himself everything in order to give to others according to their needs, contemplative, even
                    mystical, in his communion with his Lord, always with an eye single to the promotion of the Kingdom
                    of God in this world and to an eternity of blessedness hereafter. He was also a person of historical
                    significance—one of the greatest of the comparatively small group who laid the foundation
                    of the Roman Catholic Church in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Sister Mary Salesia's biography presents Bishop Bruté admirably from both of
                    these points of view. It is to be feared, however, that the combination will cause the work to be
                    received with less favor than it is entitled to. The religiously minded may find historical details
                    uninteresting, and some of the historically minded who are not members of the Catholic church may
                    misjudge the tone of piety which characterizes the narrative. If this is the case, it is
                    unfortunate, for Sister <pb n="171" id="VAA4025-027-2-089"/> Mary Salesia has made a very valuable
                    contribution to Indiana history and has given us what may well be regarded as a definitive account
                    of the first bishop of the diocese of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Simon William Gabriel Bruté de Rémur was born at Rennes, Little Brittany, March
                    20, 1779, in an upper class wealthy family. Devout from his earliest boyhood he was educated first
                    as a physician, but in 1803 he gave up what promised to be a brilliant career in medicine to enter
                    the Seminary of St. Sulpice and was ordained priest in 1808. After teaching in the Seminary for a
                    while, he embarked for America, then a mission field, on June 10, 1810. He first became professor of
                    philosophy in St. Mary's Seminary at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                    </placeName>, then was assigned to Mt. St. Mary's near Emmitsburg, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mdu">Maryland</region>
                    </placeName>, about fifty-two miles from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In this little institution he distinguished himself by unsparing devotion to his
                    duties and unselfish response to every spiritual call made upon him. He became president of St.
                    Mary's College, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                    </placeName> (1815-18) but returned to the Mountain [near Emmitsburg] for the years 1818-34.</p>
            <p>In these relatively humble capacities Father Bruté became widely known for his
                    unselfishness, his austerity, and his spirituality, as well as for his immense erudition. His
                    correspondence with all the leaders of the church in America and with many in <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> was extensive and helpful. During this time, as well as after he became Bishop of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, he went 'back to <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> for helpers, for financial assistance and for the purpose of telling those in authority
                    about the American field. His influence had already become very extensive when, in 1834, Pope
                    Gregory upon petition of the Second Provincial Council of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                    </placeName> created a new diocese which included Indiana and the eastern part of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, of which the city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> was made the see, and appointed him its first bishop.</p>
            <p>Bishop Bruté took possession of his Episcopal See on November 5, 1834, and from then until
                    his death, June 26, 1839, he labored incessantly with inadequate resources in the upbuilding of his
                    diocese and the uplifting of the lives of all those with whom he came in contact. In his genuine
                    protest against being made a bishop, he had pleaded ill health, attacks of ague, melancholy,
                    timidity, avoidance of all social occasions, inability to, converse in English ("I lose the
                    half of it and I <pb n="172" id="VAA4025-027-2-090"/> am not understood"), the early loss
                    of all his teeth, incapacity of speaking in public, lack of any ability for business and government,
                    extreme poverty, and lack of clothing. It is no wonder that some of his best friends advised against
                    his appointment on the ground of his eccentricities. Notwithstanding all this, however, he was a
                    most efficient as well as a most saintly bishop. Though he was one of the foremost scholars in
                    America and would have preferred to study and teach theology and history, he journeyed incessantly
                    throughout his diocese under conditions which made travel a real hardship and directed most ably the
                    difficult affairs in his charge. He commanded the respect and admiration of Protestants and
                    non-church members, as well as the veneration of those of his own faith. The summary of the growth
                    of churches and church buildings which developed during his episcopacy (pp. 413-17) is ample
                    testimony to Bishop Brute's work as well as to the development of the region which called
                    for the creation of a new diocese.</p>
            <p>Sister Mary Salesia does not undertake to give a history of the times. Wherever she touches upon
                    historical movements, the comments are those of one who looks at them entirely from the churchly
                    point of view. The French Revolution, for instance, is anathema, root and branch. Little attention,
                    therefore, is paid to general developments in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> or even in the Middle West. It is for matters relating to the Catholic Church in
                    America, and especially in Indiana and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, that one turns to this biography of Bishop Brute. In such matters one is seldom
                    disappointed in not finding what he wants. To cite one instance: the most authoritative and
                    satisfactory account the reviewer has found of the building of the beautiful little cathedral, now
                    the church of St. Francis Xavier in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, is given by Sister Mary Salesia. The corner stone was laid by Father Champomier on
                    March 30, 1826. It was built upon the model of the cathedral at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bardstown</settlement>
                    </placeName> according to the account in the <hi rend="i">

                    185-87. The interior and the steeple, however, were being finished in 1838 and were not entirely
                    cmpleted when Bishop Bruté died. Similarly the various churches and priests in the
                    diocese of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> are listed in detail upon the basis of contemporary and usually first-hand sources.</p>
            <pb n="173" id="VAA4025-027-2-091"/>
            <p>For her exhaustive work the author has drawn upon all known collections of documents and printed
                    material relating to Bishop Bruté. Many of the Bishop's papers have been
                    scattered and lost, but the author has found enough to give a framework entirely satisfactory to a

                    </placeName>". The general movement originated with the generation that won independence,
                    formed the first state governments and established the new federal Constitution. Citing important
                    facts in regard to the origin and history of certain eastern historical societies, Dr. Green
                    characterized the nature and work of different societies, east and west. In regard to the future,
                    the concluding passage of the address may be quoted. In this the speaker said: "University
                    departments and research institutions, privately <pb n="174" id="VAA4025-027-2-092"/> endowed
                    societies and state departments under various forms—all have their part to play; but as
                    far as we can see, societies like your own will always be needed. So I close with my best wishes for
                    the second century of the Indiana Historical Society. If I were an old-fashioned orator of the days
                    when men still ventured to quote Latin, I should say <hi rend="i">'Vivat, f lor eat,

            <head>Comment and News</head>
            <p>In many respects to be an editor, even of a state historical magazine which is issued quarterly, is
                    interesting. This is not due to tha fact that the readers write frequent letters praising or blaming
                    the editor, for such is not the case. Very seldom does any subscriber of the <hi rend="i">Indiana
                        Magazine of History</hi> write anything to the editor in the way of comment, favorable or
                    unfavorable, on the content of any issue. There is little evidence that the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> is read by more than a dozen citizens of Indiana, other than the fact that about
                    eleven hundred pay the annual dues to the Indiana Historical Society. Nevertheless, it means
                    something to edit the quarterly. During every week in the year, there is always editorial work to be
                    done whenever it is possible to extricate oneself from other duties. Best of all, since issues are
                    due in March, June, September and December, these months follow each other in rapid succession,
                    while all other months are crowded from the calendar. If anyone desires to know what it means to
                    have the side-show become the main circus, let him undertake to edit a quarterly magazine as a
                    collateral activity.</p>
            <p>The letters of Dr. E. W. H. Beck which are published in this number contain many interesting facts
                    and opinions. The point of view of a surgeon was somewhat different from that of other men in the
                    service, whether privates or officers. The letters written in the period between the battles of
                    Manassas and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Antietam</settlement>
                    </placeName> and during the days immediately following the latter battle are especially worth
                    reading. The letters written during the Wilderness Campaign in 1864, describing the raid into the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> country far to the southeast of the area where Grant was hammering Lee's army,
                    are unusually impressive. This raid was to create a diversion in Lee's rear, and was to the
                    Hoosier surgeon who reported it to his wife, a cruel, destructive and sickening type of warfare.</p>
            <p>It has often occurred to the editor that the many persons interested in varying phases of Indiana
                    history could become more helpful to each other. Frequently they could exchange <pb n="178" id="VAA4025-027-2-096"/> knowledge of events and characters of history, or better, render mutual
                    service in regard to the whereabouts of source material. The Indiana State Library, the Indiana
                    Historical Bureau and the Indiana University Library are always ready to act as clearing houses in
                    such instances. Readers of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> may also feel free to
                    send inquiries to the editor. Though there is no desire to establish a regular question and answer
                    department, queries will be inserted, whenever those who desire information see fit to present them,
                    in the hope that reliable answers may be obtained.</p>
            <p>For some time the editor has had a great desire to learn the names of the father and mother of Edward
                    Allen Hanegan who was <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Senator from Indiana from 1843 to 1849. It seems that the birthplace of this brilliant

                    to learn the names of his parents either from those who have studied his career or from living
                    descendants. It is hoped that some one who may chance to see this note will be able to supply the
                    missing data.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History.</hi> We have had a generous response to our appeals for
                    back numbers, especially for those dated later than 1914. We have a serious need for copies of
                    issues from 1905 to 1913. We very much desire to locate the four numbers of volume IV (1908); number
                    one of volume VI (1910); the four numbers of volume VII (1911); the four numbers of vol. VIII
                    (1912). We will buy further copies of the following issues: Dec., 1921; Mar., 1922; double-number
                    June-Sept., 1925.</p>
            <p>Full sets of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> can not be supplied to libraries or individuals who may
                    desire to purchase. A complete file from 1920 forward can be supplied at fifty-cents a copy or two
                    dollars per volume, unbound; from 1914 to 1919, the price is one dollar per copy, or four dollars
                    per volume; single copies from 1905-1913, when they can be supplied at all, must be priced at a much
                    higher figure.</p>
            <p>Dr. George S. Gottman, the first editor of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi>, who now
                    resides at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, R.R. 5, has a complete file of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> which he is
                    willing to sell. All numbers prior to 1913 are very scarce. The opportunity to purchase an unbroken
                    file from the beginning is unusual. The Business Manager knows of no other complete file which is
                    for sale. Anyone desiring to purchase should write directly to Mr. Cottman.</p>
