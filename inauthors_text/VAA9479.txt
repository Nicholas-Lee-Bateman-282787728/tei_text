                                                  THE author
                                                  desires to make no apologies for introducing to
                                                  the public this little volume of poems. It is
                                                  purely original, and the sweets gathered from many
                                                  years' standing. This volume is a
                                                  treasure-house in itself, and stands unequaled as
                                                  an embodiment of the ripest thoughts, wisest
                                                  utter- ances, and the most graphic illustrations
                                                  and incidents pertain- ing to this life. Its
                                                  beautiful descriptions of the home beyond, and its
                                                  relations to earth, he believes will find a
                                                  sympathetic response from the public. It vividly
                                                  describes the sufferings of our Savior upon the
                                                  cross, the patience with which He bore His
                                                  crucifixion, and the surpassing manner in which He
                                                  stilled the waves on Galilee. 
                                         The names used by the author in this work are merely
                                                  fictitious, as many of the circumstances which
                                                  gave rise to this line of thought are incidents
                                                  that have transpired under his own observation.
                                                  For the first time have been brought together in
                                                  such prominence, on the engrossing theme of the
                                                  future life, the views of one who has endeavored
                                                  to portray the beauties of heaven. 
                                         No subject is of such paramount or absorbing interest to
                                                  man as that of death and the future life.
                                                  "If a man die, shall he live
                                                  again?" is the question springing from
                                                  every heart and 
                                                  trembling on every lip. The aim of the author of
                                                  this book of poems has been to set forth, through
                                                  his best ability, the grand truth of immortality,
                                                  and the reality and glory of the home in heaven. 
                                         To any one who is beset with doubts and fears, it will
                                                  prove an armory from which bright and shining
                                                  weapons can be taken to put to flight these
                                                  enemies of their comfort and peace. It will be
                                                  precious solace to those who are laying away to
                                                  rest the loved of their homes and hearts. It will
                                                  help their faith, lift up the tearful eye to the
                                                  land of beauty, bountifulness and blessedness,
                                                  where the redeemed walk in white. It will stimu-
                                                  late them to lead better lives on earth, that they
                                                  may, through the grace of God, secure at last, the
                                                  rest and rewards of heaven.

                                                  If you would to God's holy spirit
                                                  sow.
                                                  

                                                  
                                                  For God is not mocked, I beseech you hear,
                                                  That Judgment Day is drawing near;
                                                  Whatsoever you've sown that you shall
                                                  reap
                                                  When you stand before God's judgment
                                                  seat.
                                                  

                                                  
                                                  Sow not to the flesh, for if ye do,

                                                  But a corruptible harvest you'll
                                                  gather there,--
                                                  No golden grain, but the worthless tare.
                                                  

                                                  

                                                  
                                                  But sow to the spirit, and of the spirit
                                                  reap
                                                  Life eternal at the Savior's feet;
                                                  When heaven you've reached, no more to
                                                  roam,
                                                  You can sing the songs of the harvest home.
                                                  

                                                  
                                                  Beautiful indeed are the promises given,
                                                  For all who, through Christ, for heaven hath
                                                  striven;
                                                  They fill the heart with unspeakable joy,
                                                  All malice, envy, and strife they destroy.

                                                  And nothing unreasonable doth God demand;
                                                  Then sow to the spirit, without envy or
                                                  strife,
                                                  And in heaven reap everlasting life.

                                                  But it's been quite a
                                                  spell,
                                                  Since I employed old Benny Near
                                                  To dig a door-yard well.
                                                  

                                                  
                                                  Upon the price we did agree,
                                                  After arguing quite a spell;
                                                  Then the location went to see
                                                  Where Ben should dig the well.

                                                  well!
                                                  I sent the boys the news to
                                                  strew,
                                                  Whilst I loudly rang the bell.
                                                  

                                                  
                                                  To the rescue neighbors came, a
                                                  score;
                                                  Resunk the well in haste;
                                                  The bottom reached, searched
                                                  o'er and o'er,
                                                  No corpse found any place.
                                                  

                                                  
                                                  Then up came Ben, when the work was
                                                  done,
                                                  While a grin o'erspread
                                                  his face;
                                                  So badly sold, I clutched my
                                                  gun
                                                  And hissed: "Ten minutes
                                                  grace!"
                                                  
                                        
                                        

                                        

                                        

                                        
                                                  THE FLOWERS THAT BLOOM IN
                                                  CHILDHOOD'S
                                                  CLIME.

                                                  
                                                  THE flowers
                                                  that bloom in childhood's clime
                                                  Will last as doth our lease of
                                                  time,
                                                  Till life is o'er.
                                                  For their reblooming sigh in
                                                  vain,
                                                  And that sweet clime to view
                                                  again,
                                                  We see no more.
                                                  

                                                  
                                                  When death falls like a beating
                                                  flail
                                                  On our loved ones, then we
                                                  bewail
                                                  Them stricken low.
                                                  They dwell as long as life shall
                                                  be,
                                                  A living torch in memory
                                                  That gleams o'er woe.
                                                  

                                                  
                                                  Like the shell, when far away
                                                  From beach, still murmurs
                                                  surges' sway
                                                  So sweetly soft;
                                                  As one a gem in mind would
                                                  store,
                                                  Repeats it oft, and o'er
                                                  and o'er,
                                                  With dearth of scoff.
                                                  

                                                  

                                                  
                                                  When childhood in oblivion
                                                  sleeps
                                                  Our spirits vigil o'er it
                                                  keeps,
                                                  With wakeful eye;
                                                  That blissful ray from
                                                  paradise,
                                                  Which kissed the dawning of our
                                                  life,
                                                   Anon did fly,
                                                  

                                                  
                                                  To leave us garbed in weeds of
                                                  woe;
                                                  The soul with grief must
                                                  overflow,
                                                  For want of room;
                                                  To make within our bosoms rise
                                                  A yearning for the clearer
                                                  skies
                                                  Beyond the tomb,

                                                  Unless, as little children, we
                                                  Do humbly seek
                                                  The fount divine; to cleanse from

                                                  And bear the pure life-giving

                                                  Shall ever be.
                                                  
                                        
                                        

                                        

                                        

                                        

                                                  A VIXEN HAG.

                                                  
                                                  NOW,
                                                  Willis had a vixen hag,
                                                  To share his counterpart,
                                                  Which wrought his life a weary
                                                  drag,
                                                  And put him out of heart.
                                                  

                                                  
                                                  In meek submission, long he
                                                  toiled
                                                  Beneath her tyranny;
                                                  His spirit oft inwardly boiled,
                                                  To con, I once was free.
                                                  

                                                  
                                                  But dared he not to speak a
                                                  word,
                                                  Of counsel or presage;
                                                  Her Stygian voice was loudly
                                                  heard,
                                                  At kindling of her rage.
                                                  

                                                  
                                                  He was in stature lenient,
                                                  While she was spaciously
                                                  framed;
                                                  And with her arm his will was
                                                  bent,
                                                  His vocal wrath was tamed.
                                                  

                                                  
                                                  In his lascivious stroll could
                                                  ken,
                                                   His spouse's tyrant
                                                  weight;
                                                  Though much he seemed like other
                                                  men,
                                                  Yet sateless was his state.
                                                  

                                                  

                                                  
                                                  The mail he carried to and fro;
                                                  Perchanced his horses scared
                                                  And fled, to give him such a
                                                  blow,
                                                  Which much his form impaired.
                                                  

                                                  
                                                  A prodrome ran to tell his
                                                  wife,
                                                  How ran the team away;
                                                  And how poor Willis lost his
                                                  life,
                                                  In duty's credent
                                                  sway.
                                                  

                                                  
                                                  And how the bag was torn in
                                                  two,
                                                  Its contents strewn around;
                                                  The team a broken bridge went
                                                  through--
                                                  Fell lifeless on the ground.
                                                  

                                                  
                                                  See there! Again, through
                                                  carelessness,
                                                  Exclaimed the vixen hag;
                                                  Though steeds were killed and broke
                                                  the 'bus,
                                                  He should have saved the bag.
                                                  
                                        
                                        

                                        

                                        
                                        

                                                  A BEREAVED MOTHER.

                                                  
                                                  THERE sits
                                                  an aged mother, by an old fire-place:
                                                  Care keeps watch in her dimning
                                                  eye;
                                                  Sorrow has furrowed deep lines on
                                                  her face,
                                                  And silver locks o'er her
                                                  brow tenderly lie.
                                                  

                                                  
                                                  A wave of passion her visage sweeps
                                                  o'er,
                                                  As she cons the jewels of memory
                                                  dear;
                                                  From each thrilling joy aspired
                                                  once more,
                                                  And for each sorrow there drops a
                                                  tear.
                                                  

                                                  
                                                  But where are her loved ones? She
                                                  sits all alone,
                                                  Brooding o'er treasures
                                                  ineffably dear.
                                                  Dreary the home: the nestlings have
                                                  flown;
                                                  Not one of her kindred now
                                                  lingereth near.
                                                  

                                                  
                                                  No arm of protection extended is
                                                  there.
                                                  This from her lone heart wells up a
                                                  deep sigh:
                                                  He pillowed his head with his
                                                  burden of care;
                                                  Along by the wayside, laid down to
                                                  die.
                                                  

                                                  
                                                  The flowers of affection she
                                                  nourished with pride,
                                                  And often stooped fondly to rear
                                                  the drooped head;
                                                  Excluding the shadows when sorrows
                                                  betide,
                                                  Kissing away the dark phantoms of
                                                  dread.
                                                  

                                                  

                                                  
                                                  Ah! Carried to the graveyard, and
                                                  there laid away
                                                  Beneath the bland willow: sad
                                                  vigilance keep
                                                  O'er the sweet forms that

                                                  And she, the poor mother, is left
                                                  lonely to weep.

                                                  cold, dark earth,

                                                  When she thinks of the gems of
                                                  infinite worth,
                                                  She gave back to God, that can
                                                  never die.

                                                  this strand,
                                                  A joy blest ethereal wells up in
                                                  her heart;

                                                  Trousers graced with many

                                                  Demanded sheet music, the latest

                                                  The dealer, suspecting him quite
                                                  out of place,
                                                   Unweeting to him, a joke he would

                                                  So he scanned his shelves with

                                                  The oldest pieces in stock to

                                                  there
                                                  That had been laid away in years

                                                  Then the "Old Arm

                                                  A light on earth might be.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Alas! I wandered from her care
                                                  In search of siren mirth,
                                                  By tippling at the cursed bowl:
                                                  She warned, my joys were
                                                  dearth.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  But that's been many long
                                                  years ago;
                                                  Since, many sad tears of regret
                                                  Have trinkled down my pallid
                                                  cheeks
                                                  From its results; I'd fain
                                                  forget.
                                                  

                                                  

                                                  
                                                  >But, oh! that fatal,obscure
                                                  night,
                                                  When, maddened by incessant
                                                  drink,
                                                  With dagger in her fair bosom
                                                  plunged,
                                                  I saw my facile darling sink.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  There, weltering in its crimson
                                                  blood,
                                                  Her mangled form was lying,
                                                  While bending o'er her
                                                  mother dear,
                                                  My daughter, too, sank dying.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Then, oh! my darling, bright-eyed
                                                  boy,
                                                  There gloating stood aghast
                                                  To see two mutilated forms
                                                  Abruptly before him cast.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Then waving the blood-stained
                                                  dagger high,
                                                  Half delirious, half enraged,
                                                  Wafted it o'er the
                                                  startled youth,
                                                  Who soon in flight engaged.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Fled round and round the room
                                                  pursued,
                                                  Tripped on the lifeless mass;
                                                  His gory feet with kindred
                                                  blood
                                                  Besmeared the room, alas!
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Then raised his voice and earnestly
                                                  plead:
                                                  Oh, father, please, father,
                                                  hear;
                                                  Don't murder me, as these
                                                  you have,
                                                  My mother and my sister dear.
                                                  

                                                  

                                                  
                                                  That echoing shrill, rang loud and
                                                  long,
                                                  Trills oh my heart-strings
                                                  still;
                                                  I heeded not his ards defense,
                                                  But dealt the deathly chill.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Within that chamber, stained with
                                                  crime,
                                                  I laid me down at last;
                                                  While slumber sweetly garbed my
                                                  form,
                                                  My spirit roamed the past.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  I stood again by Rosy dear,
                                                  Where love's first dreams
                                                  betide;
                                                  Through verdant groves and flowery
                                                  dell,
                                                  We wandered side by side.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  In the gloaming sat beside her,
                                                  Our hearts responding beat;
                                                  I clasped her loving hand in
                                                  mine,
                                                  With ecstasy complete.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Then woke by chill that ran my
                                                  veins,
                                                  From her cold hand clasped in
                                                  mine;
                                                  With bated breath and rifted
                                                  heart,
                                                  Beheld my bloody shrine.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Oh, heaven look down with pitying
                                                  glance,
                                                  This blood against me cry,
                                                  From these loved forms, so cold and
                                                  stark;
                                                  'Twas drink; it was not
                                                  I.
                                                  

                                                  

                                                  
                                                  Oh, could I but only waft
                                                  Back time beyond this wield,
                                                  That wrought the crimson life-blood
                                                  flow,
                                                  At last my doom to seal.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  My sentence fixed, they placed me
                                                  here,
                                                  Where hangs the haunting gloom
                                                  Of a felon's cavern, dark
                                                  and drear,
                                                  Like shadows of the tomb.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  In glowing phantoms, like a
                                                  dream,
                                                  The artist, with delight,
                                                  Will portray to this sordid
                                                  world
                                                  The horrors of that night.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  But none pierce deep like

                                                  Stale threads began to fall.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  A generous vine then ornate
                                                  grew,
                                                  And gracefully twined its way
                                                  Far up the cord, worn almost

                                                  Became a living vine.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  They nourished it with ardent

                                                  And held the shreds with kindness
                                                  there--
                                                  The commons only knew.
                                                  

                                                  

                                                  
                                                  A poor old nag, infirm by toil,

                                                  Alone we bear the blame.
                                                  

                                        
                                        

                                        

                                        
                                        
                                                  THE RESURRECTION.

                                                  
                                                  THE old
                                                  mare was sleeping her last long nap,

                                                  And all with serenity of peace was
                                                  enwrapped,
                                                  At the simple proceedings, when her
                                                  grave was filled.

                                                  It wasn't true reverence,

                                                  So he called for a

                                                  The decision given, was
                                                  resurrection;
                                                  Said a grave should enshroud the
                                                  deceased;
                                                  And sodded over, without any
                                                  objections,
                                                  She should rest in a windowless
                                                  palace of peace.
                                                  

                                                  

                                                  
                                                  So they hollowed her narrow hall

                                                  And pillowed her weary head;
                                                  And carved a line on the wooden
                                                  slab there,
                                                  In memory of the sacred dead.

                                                  The flowers shed dew-drops for
                                                  tears;
                                                  Two gentlemen alone, in wailing
                                                  despair,
                                                  Were the mourners that followed the
                                                  bier.

                                                  friends are like shadows,
                                                  Beneath a clear sky;
                                                  They follow you closely,
                                                  Wherever you hie.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  They lave in pure sweetness,
                                                  Talk infinite love;
                                                  Laud your affections,
                                                  All others above.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  But when clouds are low rising,
                                                  To darken your skies,
                                                  Then they commence shrinking,
                                                  Disclosing their disguise.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  And as the gloom thickens,
                                                  While danger you read,
                                                  Fast they are deserting,
                                                  At lightning speed.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  When missiles are hurling,
                                                  So thickly amain;
                                                  You plead for a friendship,
                                                  You failed to retain.

                                                  You ken the dire darkness,
                                                  No shadow is there;
                                                  Your heart feels a missile,
                                                  That cleaves with despair.

                                                  THE TONGUE OF CALUMNY.
                                                  
                                                  THE tongue
                                                  is an instrument of woe, that afflicts
                                                  The love and peace of humanity;
                                                  When toning the stinging discord of
                                                  vice,
                                                  It jars on the soul to a painful
                                                  degree.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  The tongue, with its vague and
                                                  poisoning influence,
                                                  Baffles the gleam of aspiring
                                                  fame;
                                                  God gave man dominion over all
                                                  creation,
                                                  Yet 'tis written,
                                                  "but the tongue can no man

                                                  When we gaze on the misery and woe
                                                  around us,
                                                  See polluted lips of gossip
                                                  kindling their flame;
                                                  By censuring the character of
                                                  struggling ones,
                                                  Heaping vain dishonor on an honest
                                                  name.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  The tongue of calumny is so swiftly
                                                  wielded,
                                                  Nothing is uttered with such
                                                  comparative ease;
                                                  Nothing more attentively listened
                                                  to,
                                                  And thus the slanderer is always
                                                  pleased.
                                                  

                                                  

                                                  
                                                  The tongue of the slanderer never
                                                  grows weary,
                                                  With its constant employment our
                                                  attention control;

                                                  too late we must learn
                                                  That there is a weakness somewhere
                                                  in our soul.

                                                  An aspiring character far above
                                                  their own sphere,
                                                  Oft degrade themselves to the
                                                  bitterst shame,
                                                  And leave them, of fame, farther
                                                  back in the read.

                                                  And brand them fiends in a hellish
                                                  cause.

                                                  You portray your own to a public

                                                  Till was finished the narrow
                                                  way,
                                                  That leads unto eternal day.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Oh, may we humbly type His
                                                  life,,
                                                  And reign with Him in paradise;
                                                  Throughout the endless speed of
                                                  time,
                                                  When our weary lives decline.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Though He treads not with us the
                                                  sod,
                                                  Yet He is Christ, the Son of
                                                  God;
                                                  His gospel spreads from shore to
                                                  shore,
                                                  And will till time shall be no
                                                  more.
                                                  
                                        
                                        

                                        

                                        
                                        
                                                  RETURNED TO LIFE.

                                                  
                                                  THE lamp
                                                  burned low on the mantel-tree,
                                                  Its pale light shone over all;
                                                  For each form a shadow could
                                                  see,
                                                  Like a phantom on the wall;
                                                  Not even one soft whispered
                                                  word
                                                  Broke on the stillness deep;
                                                  A bating breath alone was heard
                                                  From one in softest sleep.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  She was dying in this dense
                                                  gloom,
                                                  Yet it was her fancied request,
                                                  For it the fount of tears
                                                  entombed
                                                  That fell from her weeping
                                                  guest;
                                                  And in this shade, with vigilant
                                                  eye,
                                                  They watched each fleeting
                                                  breath;
                                                  For soon her gentle form must
                                                  lie
                                                  In the cold embrace of death.
                                                  

                                                  
                                                  
                                                  One hand lay in her feeble
                                                  clasp,
                                                  To her's his visage
                                                  pressed;
                                                  From her auburn hair a tress
                                                  On his care-worn face did rest.
                                                  Distreamed the burning tears
                                                  afresh,
                                                  He saw her life was sped;
                                                  A brighter light o'er all
                                                  then rushed:
                                                  It gleamed upon the dead.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  All is over; "She sleeps
                                                  in peace"
                                                  Was whispered with white lips.
                                                  Her mortal life of love has
                                                  ceased,
                                                  Ethereal dews she sips;
                                                  Like a leaf that fades away
                                                  When the frosts from heaven
                                                  fall,
                                                  Gently on the parent spray
                                                  As Death's hand falls over
                                                  all.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  She lays silent, still, and
                                                  cold,
                                                  As if an angel's hand had
                                                  lulled
                                                  To softest slumbers of the
                                                  soul,
                                                  Her form to leave annulled.
                                                  Not even one soft fleeting
                                                  breath
                                                  From voiceless lips and won
                                                  To quave the drapery on her
                                                  breast,
                                                  That snowy bosom donned.
                                                  

                                                  

                                                  
                                                  The friends that watched beside her
                                                  bed
                                                  Now crossed her pulseless
                                                  hands.
                                                  But hark! a voice broke from the
                                                  dead,
                                                  As from the spirit land;
                                                  Her rayless eyes, like orbs of
                                                  stone,
                                                  Were fixed in upward stare,
                                                  As if elysian realms alone
                                                  In secret blended there.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  A panic fell; the weeping
                                                  guests
                                                  Were chained in mortal awe;
                                                  A lifeless form, from tranquil
                                                  rest,
                                                  Returned to earth they saw;
                                                  The soul rebounded to its home
                                                  Of clay, so racked with pain--
                                                  With half uttered shrieks and
                                                  groans
                                                  That spirit sighed again.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Oh what! She sat with form
                                                  upright,
                                                  Her eyes fell from their stare;
                                                  Uplifts one hand, "Stay
                                                  not my flight,
                                                  For heaven opens there;
                                                  Oh, take me from this downy
                                                  thing
                                                  That's called me from my
                                                  rest;
                                                  My spirit hath declined to wing
                                                  From such a gorgeous
                                                  nest."
                                                  

                                                  

                                                  
                                                  They moved her from affluent
                                                  shroud
                                                  Upon a lowly bed;
                                                  No pomp of wealth was now
                                                  allowed
                                                  To float above the dead;
                                                  And he who oft, in love's
                                                  embrace,
                                                  Had clasped her to his breast,
                                                  Gazed long upon the death-kissed
                                                  face,
                                                  Clothed in its angelic rest.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Oft where willow shadows blend
                                                  And roses dew-drops weep,
                                                  And moaning winds their sadness
                                                  lend,
                                                  And stars their vigils keep,
                                                  There wander footsteps, as in
                                                  quest
                                                  To con the hallowed past;
                                                  Deep in his memory's
                                                  recess
                                                  Her loving image last.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  With silken robes inwrought with
                                                  gold
                                                  She donned in gay attire;
                                                  The pride of wealth is left
                                                  untold
                                                  Where brightest hopes aspire;
                                                  But when the chilling death winds
                                                  sighed
                                                  Upon the shadowed lea,
                                                  Abhorring pride of wealth, she
                                                  died
                                                  In meek humility.
                                                  
                                        
                                        

                                        

                                        
                                        
                                                  OUR LOST JEWEL.

                                                  
                                                  GONE from
                                                  our sight, but not our hearts,
                                                  Sweet lovely youth so soon;
                                                  Estella, dear, 'twas hard
                                                  to part,
                                                  And lay thee in the silent
                                                  tomb.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Gone from this world of pain and
                                                  grief,
                                                  To blissful realms of peace and
                                                  love;
                                                  God sent his angels of relief,
                                                  To guide thee to that home

                                                  Our erring spirits there to
                                                  guide;
                                                  Guardian angel on earth, of

                                                  Oft we'll wander to thy
                                                  green grave,
                                                  In yonder city of the dead;
                                                  Remembering the last fond look you
                                                  gave,
                                                  The last kind word you said.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  That sacred mound will mark the
                                                  place,
                                                  In yonder grave-yard fair;
                                                  We, too, as close our mortal
                                                  race,
                                                  Shall with you slumber there.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  But as we search God's
                                                  word, we see
                                                  The promise Christ hath given;
                                                  That if on earth we faithful
                                                  be,
                                                  With you shall reign in heaven.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  You shuddered not, as death drew
                                                  near,
                                                  Nor held the tomb in dread
                                                  despair;
                                                  Garbed in faith, there existed no
                                                  fear,
                                                  Christ, whom you loved, had
                                                  slumbered there.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Dear Estella, you smiled upon the
                                                  pangs of death,
                                                  As the light of your sweet life
                                                  closed;
                                                  We, in the bitterness of sorrow are
                                                  left,
                                                  While yours is sweet repose.
                                                  

                                                  

                                                  
                                                  Wait beyond the gloom to meet
                                                  us,
                                                  Upon the brink of heaven's

                                                  Lift the weary freights of
                                                  misery
                                                  From the burdened mind where wants
                                                  betide.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  And should misfortune oblige a
                                                  retreat
                                                  To the more humble walks of
                                                  life,
                                                  Would he enter the darkness of your
                                                  defeat,
                                                  With the fondness of yore, to calm
                                                  your strife?
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  By sickness retired from the busy
                                                  throng,
                                                  Would he follow to your gloomy
                                                  retreat,
                                                  Administer to your wants, with
                                                  cheering song,
                                                  And friendly affections oft
                                                  repeat?
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Should death sever the last earthly
                                                  tie,
                                                  Shed a tear on your lonely
                                                  grave,
                                                  And cherish that friendship that
                                                  never can die,
                                                  Strew some flowers, for the breezes
                                                  to wave?
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  When this is true, then cling to
                                                  the one,
                                                  That in these changes so clung to
                                                  you;
                                                  With the strongest ties affection
                                                  can own,
                                                  Cherish the friend that to you is
                                                  true.
                                                  

                                                  

                                                  
                                                  For friendship, when flawed by
                                                  violence,
                                                  No tendrils can e'er knit
                                                  the wound;
                                                  We never can trust, though they may
                                                  relent
                                                  Of the folly, and suffer their
                                                  doom.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  We may forgive, but cannot
                                                  forget:
                                                  The heart bears a scar time
                                                  ne'er can erase.
                                                  We lay down their friendship, with
                                                  deepest regret;
                                                  At the memory of bliss a yearning
                                                  takes place.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Then remember, kind reader, if you
                                                  should be blest
                                                  With the friendship of one true,
                                                  devoted friend,
                                                  To worship your idol with fond
                                                  caress,

                                                  How sad
                                                  the sight of the autumn groves,
                                                  Where withered leaves are seen;
                                                  Of beauteous verdure all
                                                  unclothed,
                                                  Once garbed in robes of green.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  The birds from their desolate bows
                                                  have flown,
                                                  We hear the sweet songsters no
                                                  more;
                                                  We sigh for the sunshine of happy
                                                  days gone,
                                                  We think of the pleasures of
                                                  yore.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  The bleak wind, with its searing
                                                  blast,
                                                  Crisp every spray of green;
                                                  Shroud in white wan nature in
                                                  death,
                                                  Hush every song serene.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Oh! why then crave for more to
                                                  do!
                                                  In either good or wrong;
                                                  Gone is the verdure and music
                                                  too,
                                                  Oh! let the flowers live on!
                                                  

                                                  

                                                  
                                                  But alas! they find a lonely
                                                  grave,
                                                  Beneath a drifted mound;
                                                  While above the storm fiend
                                                  rave,
                                                  They wither on the ground.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  There's one that perished
                                                  with the flowers,
                                                  The unknown shade to greet,
                                                  Whose graceful smile perfumed
                                                  love's bowers--
                                                  She sank in blissful sleep.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Green may be the grove and

                                                  The birds return to sing;
                                                  But never will my cherished
                                                  flower,
                                                  Return my heart to bring.

                                                  The cow-boy made a staff of
                                                  steel,
                                                  Encountering many a foe;
                                                  He lets his master weapon keel,
                                                  The signal sound of woe.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  But as his victim sank in gore,
                                                  There came a responsive crash;
                                                  The cow-boy's lamp of life
                                                  turned o'er,
                                                  And sank against the sash.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Then said the soldier donned in
                                                  blue,
                                                  We'd better bide this

                                                  These victims of disloyal.
                                                  

                                                  

                                                  
                                                  Then they took the
                                                  stageman's teams,
                                                  Unhitched each foaming steed;

                                                  Then in the bracken dashed in
                                                  haste,

                                                  Or the rustle of a spray,
                                                  Alongside the drifted wall.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Then soon a glittering sheen of

                                                  A camp-fire's ruby embers
                                                  bright,
                                                  Peers down their way full near.

                                                  The mountains rose on either

                                                  In rear their cavern lay.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Then proposed the miner brave,
                                                  To climb the cliffy raise;
                                                  And from the rooftree of their

                                                  To seek a closer gaze.
                                                  

                                                  

                                                  
                                                  Then disrobing coat and vest,
                                                  And boots left by the way;
                                                  To be incumbered was not best,
                                                  In feats of dangerous play.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  They ascended from shrub to

                                                  A wild look peered from gaunty
                                                  eyes,
                                                  Their steps were vacillant;
                                                  Like starving wolves in search of
                                                  prey,
                                                  They sought their rations
                                                  scant.

                                                  food,
                                                  Should there be severed some,
                                                  Would eagerly scratch the filthy
                                                  dust,
                                                  To gain the sacred crumb.

                                                  enthralled,
                                                  They'd turned an eager
                                                  ear;
                                                  To divers deeds of weal or woe,
                                                  Which strengthened hope or
                                                  fear.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Sundry watches guarded close
                                                  The walls on every side;
                                                  Enacting inhuman subtlety
                                                  Whene'er their cort was
                                                  tried.

                                                  Which spoke the stern command.

                                                  From the perpetual sway.

                                                  To sacrifice of life.

                                                  To bear to loved, by him so
                                                  dear,
                                                  When he's resigned to
                                                  rest.

                                                  To mix in the polluted mire,
                                                  Where victims drank from mud.

                                                  Upon a passing bier;

                                                  A shapeless mangled heap;

                                                  Or a single eye to weep.

                                                  The forms, beloves, endears;
                                                  Where rapture once illumed the
                                                  eye,
                                                  Destreams the bitter tears.

                                                  By those alleged and heartless
                                                  murderers,
                                                  Distained by nameless crime.

                                                  From all humanity.

                                                  quite,
                                                  Captured they were soon;
                                                  While lowing hounds lapped up the
                                                  blood
                                                  Destreaming from their wound.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Then, doomed to stocks, if life
                                                  remained;
                                                  Enough to feel the awe
                                                  Of punishment from parching
                                                  thirst,
                                                  Or appetite's vain
                                                  gnaw.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  So the scout, ere long,
                                                  enthralled,
                                                  Grew weak, and lank, and lean;
                                                  Unwholesome diet consorted
                                                  quite
                                                  With the murky stream.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Freedom came, the ruling
                                                  thought
                                                  Around his spirit wound;
                                                  Desponding souls in Tophet
                                                  plunged,
                                                  This river floated down.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  So day by day, with wary eye,
                                                  Surveyed, deploringly,
                                                  The dangerous and demurred
                                                  escape
                                                  To priceless liberty.
                                                  

                                                  

                                                  
                                                  For well he knew, ere the angel
                                                  peace
                                                  Through fiery deluge seen,
                                                  Many wan and weary ones
                                                  Would slumber 'neath the
                                                  green.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Soon his peering eye espied
                                                  A plan, well crouched, was
                                                  sure;
                                                  The sentinel at the guarded
                                                  gate,
                                                  His passage would innure.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Hakums for identity
                                                  Inferred a sign that told;
                                                  A ribbon red in grand display
                                                  Waved from a button-hole.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  And obscure fraud well crouched
                                                  alone,
                                                  Played by an au-fait hand;
                                                  Would dare his cherished freedom
                                                  yield,
                                                  From the traitor band.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Victory would spread her fragrant
                                                  folds,
                                                  If ribbon he only had;
                                                  To knot upon his dirty blue,
                                                  And pass a hakum sad.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  The pockets of his livery,
                                                  Were searched with anxious
                                                  care;
                                                  Found undisturbed by pillagers,
                                                  A lock of golden hair,
                                                  

                                                  

                                                  
                                                  With ribbon red wreathed
                                                  gracefully,
                                                  Met his glad surprise;
                                                  Nor did that loving bride
                                                  e'er dream,
                                                  Its worth in the soldier's
                                                  eyes.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  When gathering shades begin to
                                                  close
                                                  The eyelids of the day,
                                                  Toward the gate, with careless
                                                  step,
                                                  He sought the dubious way.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  With ribbon floating to the
                                                  breeze,
                                                  Branding him a hakum;
                                                  The haughty guards gazed on the
                                                  shred,
                                                  Then bade him onward come.

                                                  strolled,
                                                  To gain the obscure rear;
                                                  There plunged into the darkness
                                                  dense;
                                                  No sentinel was near.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  With breathless flight he spanned a
                                                  space,
                                                  Then, crouching low to list
                                                  For lowing hounds'
                                                  infernal bay,
                                                  Tracking down this mist.

                                                  near,
                                                  He breathed in better cheer;
                                                  Freedom, on her jeweled wings,
                                                  Just now seemed soaring near.
                                                  

                                                  

                                                  
                                                  Then to the railroad sought his
                                                  way,
                                                  Near the tank to crawl,
                                                  Where paused a passing train of
                                                  fate,
                                                  Replenishing tendril.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  There in the tall and matted
                                                  grass,
                                                  Humbling quite low,
                                                  To shun the peering, searching
                                                  rays
                                                  The head-light there would
                                                  throw.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  But hush! he heard approaching
                                                  steps
                                                  Trip softly, yet apace;
                                                  He wondered if the foe would
                                                  search
                                                  In that unfrequented place.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Then a plaintive voice was
                                                  heard,
                                                  Invoking low a prayer,
                                                  To reach his home and darling
                                                  ones--
                                                  That God his life would spare.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  It was a comrade he perceived,
                                                  Escaping the same old way;
                                                  And ere the morrow's sun
                                                  would vade,
                                                  Would fall the
                                                  blood-hounds' prey.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Those pleading aids the spy had
                                                  heard,
                                                  Still tingled in his breast;
                                                  He knew the perils beset his
                                                  way,
                                                  That had befell the rest.
                                                  

                                                  

                                                  
                                                  So when his obscure steps had
                                                  gained
                                                  To him the nearest rail,
                                                  "Comrade," broke
                                                  forth from him below;
                                                  He paused like one assailed.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Erect his stature, to gloat in
                                                  gloom,
                                                  Spell-bound and deep amazed;
                                                  "Comrade," then a
                                                  vivid form
                                                  From its cavern raised.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  In low, hushed tones he called him
                                                  aside,
                                                  Expounding well his plan;
                                                  To his delight, perceived he
                                                  held
                                                  A weapon in his hand.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Of which he from a rebel guard
                                                  Had forced, while wood they
                                                  gleaned;
                                                  While 'neath a blow he
                                                  weltered low,
                                                  Disumed his arms unseen.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Anon he then besought the way
                                                  That scores had tried, to fail,
                                                  Resolving thus no yield to
                                                  know--
                                                  Death should alone prevail.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  But now he saw by artful
                                                  schemes,
                                                  Imparted was a way,
                                                  To leave behind no scented
                                                  trail,
                                                  For blood-hounds'
                                                  thrilling bay.
                                                  

                                                  

                                                  
                                                  Soon a distant rumbling sound
                                                  Broke on their wakeful ears;
                                                  Would the freight, as usual,
                                                  pause?
                                                  This thought aspired their
                                                  fears.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Alack! the head-light sprang in
                                                  view
                                                  Far down the narrow glade,
                                                  That stretched away twixt walls of
                                                  gloom
                                                  And densely phantomed shade.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Obscurely crouched they, breathless
                                                  in
                                                  The purlieu of the glade,
                                                  And anxiously awaiting there,
                                                  The nearing light to vade.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  A whistle, then the clash of
                                                  brakes,
                                                  The halting train passed near;
                                                  The fugitives then sought out a
                                                  box,
                                                  The farthest from the rear.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Its seal surrendered to their
                                                  will,
                                                  Preforcing back the door,
                                                  Where grating tones were drowned
                                                  'neath
                                                  The
                                                  'scape-valve's hissing roar.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Then cautiously they crept
                                                  within,
                                                  And closed their narrow way;
                                                  Now came the clicking to and
                                                  fro;
                                                  Their coach begun to sway.
                                                  

                                                  

                                                  
                                                  Straight to the stockade quick were
                                                  rolled,
                                                  Stopped at the signal call;
                                                  Should that car be wanted there
                                                  Their scheme in atoms fall.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  The moments numbered through the
                                                  pause,
                                                  Like loathsome years did roll;
                                                  For suspension yields no rest
                                                  To the ever-longing soul.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Then soon the train was southward
                                                  speeding,
                                                  Bearing them adown
                                                  Into Dixie's peerless
                                                  heart,
                                                  Where rebel powers abound.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Revolters there to roam among,
                                                  Yet their hearts were gleed
                                                  To know that from the
                                                  tyrants' fang
                                                  Momentarily they were freed.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Where naught had waved the fragrant
                                                  leaves
                                                  Of freedom evolution,
                                                  To them, like to the Quashees,
                                                  was
                                                  A dream of victory won.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Soon scores of miles were quickly
                                                  gained,
                                                  Few pauses woke their fear;
                                                  Again the train began to halt
                                                  In its mad career.
                                                  

                                                  

                                                  
                                                  Then slyly from their cavern
                                                  dark,
                                                  They groped their weary way,
                                                  And sprang upon the turf below,
                                                  To plunge in bloody fray.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  The haughty fiends their freedom
                                                  sought,
                                                  To wrench from infirm hands,
                                                  But death was the only
                                                  capsulate
                                                  That dared their strength
                                                  command.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Down stormed the foe with fire and
                                                  sword,
                                                  Like surges on the rock,
                                                  Upon two fearless Federals,
                                                  Who dauntless braved the shock.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Defiant with rebellious fiends,
                                                  Returned them blow for blow;
                                                  From wield on wield effused the
                                                  blood
                                                  From mangled forms laid low.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Stripped of affluence left their
                                                  forms,
                                                  And garbs exchanging quite,
                                                  In style and custom of the gray
                                                  Could better wing their flight.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Now the morning-star appears;
                                                  The harbinger of light,
                                                  Peers from the eastern horizon
                                                  To rift the gloom of night.
                                                  

                                                  

                                                  
                                                  No time was spared to court a
                                                  muse,
                                                  But sought anon their way
                                                  Into the morass, strange and
                                                  dark,
                                                  To pass the dawning day.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Where by night the glow-worm
                                                  shone,
                                                  In humid brake to camp;
                                                  Where human hearts could scarcely
                                                  brave
                                                  The quaking turf to tramp.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Here morn in rosy splendor
                                                  broke,
                                                  With radiant beams of light,
                                                  Piercing shadows, with bright
                                                  rays,
                                                  Dispelling gloomy night.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  The dew-drops sparkled from each
                                                  bower,
                                                  All things seemed boundless
                                                  free;
                                                  The wild birds' carols
                                                  rend the air
                                                  With songs of liberty.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  But ere the mid-day shadows
                                                  turn,
                                                  They heard the
                                                  blood-hound's bay
                                                  And horses' tramp
                                                  encircling
                                                  The fen not far away.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  In breathless awe they scringed and
                                                  crowded,
                                                  List with distrusting ear,
                                                  The nearing of incessant
                                                  sounds,
                                                  With well replenished fear.
                                                  

                                                  

                                                  
                                                  Then a muttering storm ensued;
                                                  The chivalry retired
                                                  Beneath an ancient leafy dome,
                                                  Until the gloom expired.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  The fugitives from motions
                                                  read,
                                                  And fully comprehended;
                                                  Effusion of the blood that morn
                                                  Had threatening ire expanded.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Instinctively an unkind breach
                                                  Had fallen foes between;
                                                  This poising fear so urging
                                                  fell,
                                                  They quit the fen unseen.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  To gain the river was a feat
                                                  That brooked no little fear;
                                                  To leave the foe behooved them
                                                  now,
                                                  Still sheltering in the rear.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  A narrow path they shortly
                                                  spied,
                                                  That wound the glen adown;
                                                  Beside an affluent threading
                                                  rill,
                                                  That to their goal wound.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  The storm it ceased; the sun bent

                                                  A sheen of golden light,
                                                  Enfringed the rifted clouds

                                                  A sweet celestial sight.

                                                  The fugitives pressed hard,
                                                  For fear their heartless rivals
                                                  should
                                                  Whelm them on the sward.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Some distance gained, they quit the
                                                  glade,
                                                  To crouch in ambush dark,

                                                  Its last sweet dimming spark.

                                                  That rang in air was rife.

                                                  With head bowed low, and thought
                                                  apace,
                                                  To ken some theme to suit my
                                                  case;
                                                  Many a spectre came in sight,
                                                  But ere I grasped, had taken
                                                  flight.

                                                  One moment in sweet visions
                                                  swelled,
                                                  Of witches astride a human
                                                  frame,
                                                  And nameless others near the
                                                  same,
                                                  Came jostling on the wheels of
                                                  thought,
                                                  But just a glimpse of them I
                                                  caught.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Then blood and thunder all
                                                  amain,
                                                  Entailed came thronging to my
                                                  brain,
                                                  And loudly knocked for
                                                  entrance,
                                                  Clamoring their dire suspense;
                                                  I essayed to write the lot,
                                                  But lo! my pen refused to jot.
                                                  

                                                  

                                                  
                                                  All visions fled, and pondering
                                                  late,
                                                  Distracted by this ruthful
                                                  fate;
                                                  At last I mounted on a theme,
                                                  And swiftly rode it down the
                                                  stream
                                                  Of thought, till it full captured
                                                  lay,
                                                  Wan and stark, beneath my sway.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Ah! the prey, when viewed with
                                                  care,
                                                  Did suit my purpose to a hair;
                                                  First, I in prose began its
                                                  worth,
                                                  But soon perceived its higher
                                                  birth;
                                                  For voices of the heart would
                                                  be
                                                  More lucid wrought in poetry.

                                                  Close
                                                  beside a gushing rivulet,
                                                  Where willows waved their graceful

                                                  This scene of rustic beauty;

                                                  While the bell rang o'er
                                                  the village.

                                                  Summoning our choir together;

                                                  It remains so out of sight;
                                                  But with patient labor waiting,

                                                  At the station of Hollansburg;

                                                  A tramp through the darkness
                                                  emerged.

                                                  Serenely my heart did bless;
                                                  From weary strife my soul was
                                                  freed,
                                                  To meet her fond caress.

                                                  For life is what we make it;

                                                  bliss,
                                                  For in sorrow we mistake it.

                                                  FATHER SAYS.
                                                  
                                                  ONCE on a
                                                  time, 'tis no matter when,
                                                  There lived, like many have lived
                                                  since then,
                                                  A gentleman who loved with all his
                                                  might,
                                                  But she jilted him, and affections
                                                  were blight.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  So he appealed to his father, to
                                                  know how to improve,
                                                  To regain the affections of his

                                                  His father's advice to him
                                                  did impart,
                                                  To fall at her feet and say,
                                                  "You've stolen my

                                                  So away he flew, over hill and

                                                  And all you could see was his

                                                  And fell at her feet, his claim to
                                                  recover;
                                                  Quoth he: "Lovely lady,

                                                  Into the rare dense shade,
                                                  Meditating on golden days,
                                                  With sighs that they should

                                                  The river soon would swell;

                                                  This thought his steps propel.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  The sleety brink was gained with

                                                  He sounded the ice with care;
                                                  The wideness of the span
                                                  indeed,
                                                  Distracted his mind with fear.

                                                  Projecting the dangerous way,
                                                  Where naught but slightest trail
                                                  was seen,
                                                  By golden light of day.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Yet he resolved the stream to
                                                  cross,
                                                  And thus a distance gain;
                                                  To free himself, though life it
                                                  cost,
                                                  From tarnish on his name.

                                                  brave,
                                                  Who now was helpless wrought;
                                                  To the monarch of the tyrant
                                                  wave,
                                                  Invoked his fleetest thought.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Next morn, within a moored
                                                  bark,
                                                  There stood a lad aghast,
                                                  To see a form, so stiff and
                                                  stark,
                                                  Stand floating, frozen fast.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  One hand outstretched as if for
                                                  aid,
                                                  His face turned toward the sky;
                                                  The gleaming morning light
                                                  delaid,
                                                  On his fixed and sightless eye.
                                                  
                                        
                                        


                                        

                                        

                                        

                                                  CHARITY.
                                                  
                                                  OH, what
                                                  does the word charity imply?
                                                  The poor beggar asked his
                                                  heart;
                                                  Does it mean the imploring look to
                                                  defy,
                                                  Or jest at sad tears as they
                                                  start?
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Does charity mean to look with
                                                  scorn
                                                  On those who are shabbily clad?
                                                  Or to cheer the sad and
                                                  forlorn--
                                                  Clothe the naked and make them
                                                  glad?
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Does charity mean to turn your
                                                  back
                                                  On those who are sick and
                                                  distressed?
                                                  Or that your energy never should
                                                  slack,
                                                  Where you can administer to the
                                                  oppressed?
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Does it mean denial to the
                                                  oppressed,
                                                  To stay life's tender
                                                  thread?
                                                  Or to submit to self's
                                                  behest,
                                                  And give a stone for bread?
                                                  

                                                  

                                                  
                                                  Charity, like dew from heaven,
                                                  falls
                                                  Gently on the drooping flowers;
                                                  Refreshing and reviving all,
                                                  'Neath its majestic
                                                  powers.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  A fountain welling forth so
                                                  pure,
                                                  Adversary's wounds to
                                                  heal;
                                                  The good of others to inure,
                                                  By its ever fruitful field.
                                                  
                                        
                                        


                                        

                                        

                                        

                                                  A NARROW ESCAPE.

                                                  
                                                  JUST as I
                                                  entered a stately wood,
                                                  A cyclone came in sight;
                                                  From lightning's glare,
                                                  o'er rolling clouds,
                                                  My bosom thrilled with fright.
                                                  Nearing seemed invader bleak,
                                                  By direful din of tread;
                                                  Aghast, before its peerless
                                                  sway,
                                                  I stood enthralled in dread.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  At length I spied an oaken log,
                                                  With portals open swung;
                                                  I groveled in its cavern rude,
                                                  As thunders o'er me
                                                  rung.
                                                  Down came the muttering storm
                                                  amain,
                                                  To wield its torrent ire;
                                                  The bleak earth seemed in tremor
                                                  'neath
                                                  Its thunder sheen of fire.
                                                  

                                                  

                                                  
                                                  Trampling down the aged forest,
                                                  Full tyranny impelled;
                                                  Across the threshold of my
                                                  grotto,
                                                  A huge old timber felled.
                                                  Oh, ruthless fate! Why thus
                                                  exact
                                                  This loathsome doom for me?
                                                  Then I thought of Christ, who
                                                  stilled
                                                  The waves on Gallilee.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  The calm then told the storm had
                                                  passed,
                                                  To rift the gloomy fog,
                                                  A single ray of light gleamed
                                                  through
                                                  A knot-hole in the log.
                                                  Crawling back, I pressed my
                                                  lips
                                                  Against the rural frame,
                                                  And bellowed loud prolonging
                                                  tones,
                                                  But still no answer came.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  The echo of my wailing cry,
                                                  Alone the forest rung;
                                                  Then visions of eternity
                                                  Into actual being sprung.
                                                  Starvation soft came stealing
                                                  on,
                                                  Life's voyage would soon
                                                  be o'er;
                                                  No angel hands could roll the
                                                  stone
                                                  From my sepulchral's
                                                  door.
                                                  

                                                  

                                                  
                                                  Most reverent Father, I lisped in
                                                  prayer,
                                                  My many sins forgive;
                                                  My soul commit I to Thy care,
                                                  In realms of bliss to live.
                                                  No tears fall o'er my
                                                  sinking form,
                                                  I feel thy love sublime;
                                                  To kindred, loved ones, all
                                                  unknown,
                                                  My bark takes leave of time.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  And far adown death's
                                                  silent Lethe,
                                                  Hope sees that cheering star;
                                                  But hark! I'm dashed on a
                                                  latent rock,
                                                  A blast my conscience spar.
                                                  One sin so gross I did neglect,
                                                  Enigmaed failed to rue:
                                                  Do unto others as you would
                                                  That they should do to you.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  So base a crime my form abated,
                                                  I seemed so mean and small,
                                                  That in less time than here
                                                  related,
                                                  Out through the knot-hole I did
                                                  crawl.
                                                  So now I'll live a better
                                                  man:
                                                  When summoned sure to go,
                                                  I may not drift a dreary wreck,
                                                  On the reef of endless woe.
                                                  
                                        
                                        

                                        

                                        

                                        

                                                  'T WAS YEARS
                                                  AGO.

                                                  
                                                  TWAS years
                                                  ago, when I, a boy,
                                                  Roamed free, without a care;
                                                  With constant wish to be a man,
                                                  And honor's crown to
                                                  wear.

                                                  
                                                  
                                                  I felt the years drag slowly
                                                  by,
                                                  That into manhood rolled;
                                                  When I might stand as others
                                                  stood,
                                                  Life's problem to
                                                  unfold.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  But by and by the day it came,
                                                  When I, a man declared,
                                                  Some grand achievements I would
                                                  win,
                                                  Although quite unprepared.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Then sailed I forth, with raptured
                                                  heart,
                                                  Where fancy did direct;
                                                  But found, to my intense
                                                  surprise,
                                                  That life was real, in fact.
                                                  

                                                  

                                                  
                                                  I found that jewels of valued
                                                  worth
                                                  Were not with pittance bought;
                                                  Nor honors lasting long
                                                  conferred,
                                                  Except through merit wrought.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Then I, like many other minds,
                                                  Relinquished all my zeal,
                                                  Because life's stern
                                                  realities
                                                  Made me so little feel.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Since then the years have winged so
                                                  fast
                                                  Towards life's fated
                                                  goal;
                                                  Yet intents of my
                                                  boyhood's dreams
                                                  Doth some import control.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Were the past vouchsafed to me,
                                                  I ween the step I'd
                                                  take
                                                  Would be to bind timidity
                                                  Fast to the burnished stake.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  But all will make extreme
                                                  mistakes,
                                                  Oft chances stumble
                                                  o'er;
                                                  And when too late bewail their
                                                  fate,
                                                  That they return no more.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  But as we struggle on our way,
                                                  They prove a priceless lear;

                                                  Is an unsullied name.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  And when on life's
                                                  declining plain,
                                                  Fast nearing to the goal,
                                                  How sweet a thought to know that
                                                  we
                                                  Have an untarnished soul.
                                                  
                                        
                                        


                                        

                                        

                                        

                                                  THE OLD PLAY-GROUND.

                                                  
                                                  I'VE wandered to the old
                                                  play-ground,
                                                  Where, in the treasured past,
                                                  My voice with play-mates did
                                                  resound
                                                  In many a pleasant cast,
                                                  And viewed again the scenes of
                                                  yore,
                                                  Alas! in memory,
                                                  Many alone I could explore,
                                                  They were no more to be.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  The old elm waved its foliage
                                                  proud
                                                  Beside the path that took
                                                  Its way to the hill that
                                                  overbrowed
                                                  The laughing pebbled brook;
                                                  The path is sodded o'er
                                                  with green,
                                                  The brook is drained away,
                                                  And many shades are now unseen
                                                  'Neath which we used to
                                                  play.
                                                  

                                                  

                                                  
                                                  The old school-house is torn
                                                  away,
                                                  A new one fills its place;
                                                  Still in fancy to our day
                                                  There seems not half the grace.
                                                  The old wood-shed is standing
                                                  still,
                                                  Just as it used to be;
                                                  When rain would drive us from the
                                                  hill,
                                                  We'd seek its canopy.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  The old ground where at ball we
                                                  played,
                                                  High on the wooded plain,
                                                  With thorns and briers
                                                  overlaid,
                                                  I scarcely view could gain:
                                                  Yet many children gather there,
                                                  On our play-ground, I see,
                                                  Who seem as rompish as we were,
                                                  With spirits tuned to glee.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  But where are those who played with
                                                  me,
                                                  Or lesson pondered
                                                  o'er,
                                                  Or sat beneath the greenwood
                                                  tree,
                                                  Or roamed the shorn moor?
                                                  Ah! scattered as a gale would
                                                  blow
                                                  Chaff from a threshing floor;
                                                  Some in silence slumber low,
                                                  Where flowers wave them
                                                  o'er.

                                                  And in oblivion youth will be,
                                                  Which happily I ken;

                                                  For they cheer the loneliest
                                                  places,
                                                  All their gloominess destroy.

                                                  Echoes through the transit day,
                                                  And our hearts are sadly riven,
                                                  When they are torn from us
                                                  away.

                                                  Declining to weigh in the balance
                                                  of truth
                                                  The talent existing 'neath

                                                  ride.
                                                  But step by step, with a purpose

                                                  Through this cold world, dejected,

                                                  enraged;

                                                  engaged,
                                                  And pride shall be unfurled.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  And then he dealt Love such a
                                                  blow,
                                                  Just o'er the orbs of
                                                  sight,
                                                  Knocking him stone-blind, you
                                                  know,
                                                  Veiling all in night.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Then came Folly, leading Love,
                                                  To kneel at every shrine;
                                                  In pomp, or wealth, or fickle
                                                  cove,
                                                  Love is to Folly blind.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  And Folly sits enthroned with
                                                  pride,
                                                  Which Love can only know;
                                                  That she must follow
                                                  'neath his guide,
                                                  Where'er he chose to
                                                  go.
                                                  

                                        
                                        

                                        

                                        

                                                  THE J. M. WHITE.

                                                  [The J. M. White was the name of an American

                                                  was consumed by fire, just below Vicksburg, in

                                                  Through the drifting sleet of a

                                                  Her way was swiftly found.

                                                  In slumber's sweet
                                                  repose,

                                                  When glaring flames arose.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  A sheen of light lit up the

                                                  Which the watching mate
                                                  affrighted,
                                                  And soon with sweeping flames
                                                  spread o'er--
                                                  The whole ship was alighted.
                                                  

                                                  

                                                  
                                                  The fire, which kindled near the

                                                  In secret sought its way

                                                  a spoiler
                                                  Peerless in its sway.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Down came dense clouds of heated
                                                  smoke
                                                  In cabin and in state-room;
                                                  Then wailing cries the silence
                                                  broke,
                                                  For all was veiled in gloom.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  In strode the flames with seering
                                                  blast,
                                                  As the boats were loosed below;
                                                  But few they were in safety
                                                  passed
                                                  The deck, 'neath flaming
                                                  billows.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  And ever between the fitful
                                                  din,
                                                  A sound came from below;
                                                  The incessant cries of those
                                                  within,
                                                  A mingled voice of woe.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  There, standing on the smoky
                                                  deck.
                                                  Where flames were wont to span,
                                                  Was a manly form, erect:
                                                  Two daughters clasped his
                                                  hands.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  From pallid lips there came a
                                                  scream,
                                                  As they were pressed to go;
                                                  They looked on their invading
                                                  fiend,
                                                  Then on the waves below.
                                                  

                                                  

                                                  
                                                  Two helpless forms sank deep
                                                  apart,
                                                  Arose despaired, of hope
                                                  bereft,
                                                  And clasped each other heart to
                                                  heart,
                                                  With gloating eyes and bated
                                                  breath.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Did Father come? a faint sweet
                                                  tone,
                                                  She clung to a sister's
                                                  fold;
                                                  Or is it we're here in the
                                                  water alone?
                                                  Then a billow o'er them
                                                  rolled.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  They rose in exosculated vision
                                                  Of earth's last fond
                                                  adieu;
                                                  To meet within the vale
                                                  Elysian,
                                                  A calm voyage to waft anew.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  They sank, alas! no aid was
                                                  near;
                                                  Two forms arose no more;

                                                  crystal:
                                                  I essayed with her to flee,
                                                  But paused on the reef of
                                                  mortal,
                                                  Gazing in eternity.
                                                  An opaque mist then wreathed around
                                                  me,
                                                  Dimmer grew the dashing strain,
                                                  Then some mysterious power betook
                                                  me,
                                                  Gave me back to earth again.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Where a strange veil intervened
                                                  us,
                                                  Left the cold world in her
                                                  stead,
                                                  Where pleasure is a mingled
                                                  sorrow,
                                                  Showered upon the living's
                                                  head.
                                                  Pleasures come, but quickly leave
                                                  us,
                                                  Sorrows fall so thick and fast;
                                                  Fair hope gleams but to deceive
                                                  us,
                                                  The happiest hours should be the
                                                  last.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Then the loved of earth will
                                                  linger,
                                                  Softly breathe the parting
                                                  prayers;
                                                  The loved and lost await to bear
                                                  us
                                                  From the world's corroding
                                                  cares,
                                                  And ever with them there to
                                                  linger,
                                                  In endless oceans of delight,
                                                  Where no grief's invading
                                                  shadows
                                                  A single ray of joy shall
                                                  blight.
                                                  

                                        
                                        

                                        

                                        

                                                  THE POET GRASPED HIS MAGIC
                                                  PEN.

                                                  
                                                  THE poet
                                                  grasped his magic pen,
                                                  To picture the passing scene
                                                  That wound its way from the
                                                  mind's dark fen,
                                                  Like a ray of morning sheen.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  His brief thoughts grew to a
                                                  lengthened dream,
                                                  Each instance left its tread,
                                                  Where reason's torch
                                                  illumed the reame,
                                                  And ghastly phantoms fled.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Rays of thoughtfulness
                                                  inflamed,
                                                  As he paused each theme to con,
                                                  Where each fact crowded from the
                                                  brain,
                                                  A ghost of superstition.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Adown the river of his thought
                                                  Was swiftly floated on,
                                                  Peering every gloomy spot
                                                  Within the horizon.
                                                  

                                                  

                                                  
                                                  Till weary, and the day grew
                                                  late,
                                                  And short the moments last;
                                                  His spirit's heavy burdens
                                                  wrought
                                                  Was pillowed on the past.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  He conned his poems o'er
                                                  and o'er,
                                                  But dared not change the train
                                                  Of thrilling scenes in
                                                  memory's store,
                                                  Gleaned on life's turbid
                                                  main.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Then night her sable curtains
                                                  trailed
                                                  Around the poet's
                                                  lore;
                                                  Resigned to rest, and aught
                                                  bewailed,
                                                  His spirit's strife was
                                                  o'er.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  The gems of precious truth
                                                  he'd scrolled
                                                  Went drifting on the brine,
                                                  From the current to unfold
                                                  Upon the sands of time.

                                                  Where severed friends may meet
                                                  again,
                                                  Where all is free from death and
                                                  pain.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Dear friend, look up to that bright
                                                  home,
                                                  Behold the gleaming, gorgeous
                                                  throne,
                                                  Its jasper walls -- shall we meet
                                                  there,
                                                  Forever freed from pain and
                                                  care?
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Its rays gleam down the narrow
                                                  way,
                                                  No traveler need to go astray;
                                                  For the sheen that glows is
                                                  ethereal light
                                                  From the blessed throne so purely
                                                  bright.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Angels beckon you from the
                                                  gate,
                                                  Gently whispering, "be not
                                                  late."
                                                  Jesus waits in that home above
                                                  To fold you gently in arms of
                                                  love.

                                                  The festive banquet is no more;

                                                  its last farewell.

                                                  year,
                                                  This same throng may be gathered
                                                  here;
                                                  But life is uncertain, and we
                                                  cannot tell,
                                                  As we lingeringly say a last
                                                  farewell.

                                                  The vast throng changes

                                                  can tell
                                                  How many, in tears, speak the last

                                                  Or who dare presage that from this
                                                  throng,
                                                  As one year wings its march
                                                  along,
                                                  How many shall in the graveyard
                                                  dwell,
                                                  Leave rifted hearts with a last
                                                  farewell?
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  If in one year you should gather
                                                  here,
                                                  And my lithe form does not

                                                  Where the mellow sunlight soft came
                                                  down;
                                                  The humming bee and caroling
                                                  bird
                                                  In their wild liberty were
                                                  heard;
                                                  The pine its verdant foliage
                                                  waves
                                                  Where careful hands have mound the
                                                  graves,
                                                  With reverence, as if a smart
                                                  Might find its way to a pulseless
                                                  heart.

                                                  Bespeaking death so horribly
                                                  In this vast city of the dead;
                                                  In peaceful chambers lays each
                                                  head,
                                                  As thick as throng a festive

                                                  Assembled here 'neath

                                                  with grain,
                                                  Like rolling waves on the restless
                                                  main.
                                                  

                                                  

                                                  
                                                  Then he founded that village which
                                                  clusters there,
                                                  In yonder valley augustly fair;
                                                  And welcomed each emigrant into his
                                                  home,
                                                  As civilization did westward
                                                  roam;
                                                  Soon many, the cabins stood in a
                                                  row,
                                                  And round their
                                                  hearth-fire's ruddy glow,
                                                  Sat many, the maidens and
                                                  youngsters gay,
                                                  In festive sports winged the eves
                                                  away.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  When death distorted some lovely
                                                  face,
                                                  He gave to this village its burial
                                                  place;
                                                  And as the village more populous
                                                  grew,
                                                  This place of graves grew populous
                                                  too;
                                                  A wooden slab oft marked the
                                                  scene,
                                                  Some planted a verdant
                                                  evergreen:;
                                                  Holloman oft would words
                                                  impart,
                                                  To cheer the bereaved, and aching
                                                  heart.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  But now a strange generation
                                                  grew,
                                                  Naught of his parental kindness
                                                  knew;
                                                  His grayish locks were silvered
                                                  o'er,
                                                  Age had stamped his footsteps
                                                  hoar;
                                                  Fraud had limited his finance,
                                                  He fell to inauspicious chance;
                                                  Affluent friends, cold shoulders
                                                  turned,
                                                  And faded joy his sorrows
                                                  spurned.
                                                  

                                                  

                                                  
                                                  The mystic tie which the frontier
                                                  feels,
                                                  In his friend braves him to
                                                  shield,
                                                  In every storm that sweeps
                                                  o'er his head,
                                                  Or shares with him his crust of
                                                  bread;
                                                  But as protection stronger
                                                  grows,
                                                  Danger's bond more lenient
                                                  goes;
                                                  Until its power is felt no
                                                  more,
                                                  The tendril's clasping
                                                  twine is o'er.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  He had taken up his latest inn,
                                                  Accompanied by no loving kin.
                                                  No palace now his
                                                  dwelling-place,
                                                  No genial hands, with prompted
                                                  grace,
                                                  Administered to his daily want,
                                                  But all alone in this dark
                                                  haunt:
                                                  A gravel pit it projected
                                                  o'er,
                                                  Which each day crumbled more and
                                                  more.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  He would sit alone in his gloomy
                                                  place,
                                                  With furrowed, wan, and passionless
                                                  face,
                                                  And pray for death to take him
                                                  away,
                                                  For the world seemed colder each
                                                  passing day;
                                                  Oft, in low soliloquy,
                                                  Reiterated sweet memory
                                                  Of happy days far in the past,
                                                  Then bitterly sigh: they failed to
                                                  last.
                                                  

                                                  

                                                  
                                                  The furniture of his narrow
                                                  room
                                                  Was a wooden trunk, 'an
                                                  old heirloom,'
                                                  A three-legged stool, an old
                                                  arm-chair,
                                                  A rickety bedstead-- all spoke of
                                                  despair--
                                                  A stand in the corner to banquet
                                                  on--
                                                  All its brilliance of yore was
                                                  gone--
                                                  A stove, few utensils, which lay on
                                                  the floor,
                                                  Completed the hoard of his
                                                  treasured store.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  One morning the sun rose clear and
                                                  red,
                                                  But it broke not his slumbers-- he was dead.
                                                  The angel had called and taken
                                                  away
                                                  The soul from its cheerless home of
                                                  clay.
                                                  His threshold was closed so far in
                                                  the day,
                                                  Curiosity-seekers did thither
                                                  stray.
                                                  They rapped on the door again and
                                                  again
                                                  To wake him from slumber, but all
                                                  in vain.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  They opened the door. To their
                                                  great surprise
                                                  A horrid sight there met their
                                                  eyes,
                                                  For, low in the attitude of
                                                  prayer,
                                                  His aged form was bending there
                                                  Beside his cot, so lone and
                                                  drear,
                                                  They paused, aghast, spell-bound
                                                  with fear,
                                                  No audible word, no bated
                                                  breath,
                                                  His withered form was bowed in
                                                  death.
                                                  

                                                  

                                                  
                                                  That night the friends that kept
                                                  the wake
                                                  Drank deep the draft that reasons
                                                  break.
                                                  When enthralled in the
                                                  demon's sway,
                                                  They unpalled the bier where the
                                                  still form lay,
                                                  And reared it against the
                                                  time-stained wall,
                                                  While fiendish laughter rang over
                                                  all.
                                                  The contents of a vial they
                                                  poured,
                                                  Then laid it back on the draperied
                                                  board.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  My God! is this human? It is not
                                                  brute,
                                                  For the animal mourns with spirit
                                                  mute
                                                  At the sight of gore his kindred
                                                  own,
                                                  But man has a heart more flinty
                                                  than stone.
                                                  I ween if the angel that bore him
                                                  away
                                                  From the crystal door gazed back on
                                                  his clay,
                                                  Was caused to weep, if ever it
                                                  be
                                                  That spirits mourn humanity.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  In silence they bore and laid him
                                                  here,
                                                  In a grave unmoistened by a
                                                  tear.
                                                  His scanty hoard they credently
                                                  spent
                                                  To rear a respectable monument;
                                                  But soon the hillock was leveled
                                                  o'er,
                                                  The small gray stone stood up no
                                                  more.
                                                  God, in mercy, pity us all,
                                                  Who vainly the misspent past
                                                  recall.
                                                  
                                        

                                        

                                        

                                        

                                        

                                                  GRANDPA AND THE LITTLE
                                                  CHILD.

                                                  
                                                  GRANDPA,
                                                  I'm sorry you are going away,
                                                  'T will be so lonesome
                                                  here;
                                                  Returning from my festive play,
                                                  The house will seem so drear.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  I could not climb upon your
                                                  knee
                                                  To hug and kiss you, too.
                                                  Oh grandpa, please do stay with
                                                  me,
                                                  For I love you, Grandpa, I do.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  The child then leaned against his
                                                  breast,
                                                  Fast throbbed her little heart,
                                                  And o'er her drooped his
                                                  silvery crest,
                                                  Incessant tears to start.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  The old man thrice to speak
                                                  essayed,
                                                  His fount of feeling rose;
                                                  Then faintly asked what could have
                                                  bade
                                                  Such questions to disclose.
                                                  

                                                  

                                                  
                                                  The child looked up in sudden
                                                  maze,
                                                  He kissed her forehead sweet;
                                                  From fear, the tear-drops dimmed
                                                  his gaze
                                                  That he some change must meet.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  "Ma said you was"
                                                  --then came a tear--
                                                  "I don't know
                                                  what I'll do,
                                                  For none will love and pet me
                                                  here,
                                                  Dear Grandpa, like
                                                  you."
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  She affirmed that dear aunt Bee
                                                  Cared not so much for style,
                                                  Should take you to the country
                                                  To live with her awhile.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  For our house is very small;
                                                  When gairish company came
                                                  You were in the way of all,
                                                  For you were old and lame.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Then, after thinking, aunt Bee
                                                  said
                                                  'T was all that they could
                                                  do
                                                  To furnish one spare room and
                                                  bed,
                                                  And had n't means for

                                                  Where peace and happiness
                                                  e'er reigns;
                                                  Where sacred feet forever trod,
                                                  Beneath the oracle of God.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Then he heard, or seemed to
                                                  hear,
                                                  But whether in the mind or ear
                                                  He scarcely knew: so sweet the
                                                  strain,
                                                  His spirit drank the glad

                                                  Following to the luring sound,
                                                  That coursed his way a valley
                                                  down,
                                                  Where flowers were kissed by
                                                  zephyrs bland
                                                  And joy aspired on every hand.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  A murmur rose beneath his feet,
                                                  Soft and low, yet passing
                                                  sweet;
                                                  But seldom in the ears of dream
                                                  Murmurs this ethereal stream.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Then arose the crystal strand
                                                  Beyond the tide so sweetly
                                                  bland,
                                                  And loved and lost of youth, in
                                                  white,
                                                  Beckoned him to the land of
                                                  light.

                                                  With opened arms, and called his
                                                  name;
                                                  His form, benumbed, essayed to
                                                  rise,
                                                  Which chained the guests in dire

                                                  He toppled smack upon his head;
                                                  The vested angel was no more;
                                                  His leal dream at once was
                                                  o'er.

                                                  And caused me to lingeringly cling

                                                  To shew the fowl from off his
                                                  frow,
                                                  But ere he gained the
                                                  ladder's top,
                                                  Into a hogshead falls ker-flop;
                                                  His bonny bride now stung with
                                                  fear,
                                                  Sweeps with the fowl swung to her
                                                  ear--
                                                  Projects too far from the mow of
                                                  feed,
                                                  And swings a downward course with
                                                  speed.
                                                  The arts of fate were so exact,
                                                  She footed both his breast and

                                                  And she and brine alike were
                                                  spilt;

                                                  aid,
                                                  On his coat-collar both hands
                                                  laid,
                                                  There pulled with all her might and
                                                  main,
                                                  He, with his manhood, grunts and
                                                  strains;
                                                  For recompense of labor yearn,
                                                  But ne'er a bit the nails
                                                  will turn;
                                                  The cruel barbs pricked sharp his
                                                  skin--
                                                  As she pulled out, hard they pushed
                                                  in;
                                                  At last paused for a
                                                  moment's muse,
                                                  And on some skillful plan to
                                                  choose;

                                                  

                                                  Mentioned he the cade to split,
                                                  But she would not hear to it;
                                                  So she secured a rusty saw,
                                                  Upon the kit began to gnaw.
                                                  Alack! when stavings bursted
                                                  through,
                                                  She sawed his leg most half in
                                                  two;
                                                  Effusion of blood poured from his
                                                  wound,
                                                  At which she sank into a swoon;
                                                  So pale and wan, stretched on her
                                                  back,
                                                  It seemed for heaven his kit was
                                                  packed,
                                                  Tears trilled down his pallid
                                                  check,
                                                  Profusing blood now made him
                                                  weak:
                                                  Then he lisped a feeble prayer,
                                                  If some miraculous chance would
                                                  spare,
                                                  That no more chickens they would
                                                  steal,
                                                  That this they gladly would
                                                  conceal,
                                                  And here the bottom out he
                                                  kicked,
                                                  That loosed the staves, which went
                                                  to sticks;
                                                  Just then she woke and home they
                                                  ran,
                                                  And now they are called an honest

                                                  youth's happy hours, when all was
                                                  joy,
                                                  I roamed at will, a light-hearted
                                                  boy;
                                                  Not a shadow of sorrow overshaded
                                                  my brow
                                                  From the tempest of grief that
                                                  enshroudeth me now.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Long years have passed since that
                                                  memorable day,
                                                  And far from the place
                                                  I've wandered away,
                                                  But memory recalls each incident
                                                  now,
                                                  From the first fond look to
                                                  fidelity's vow.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  A maiden with tresses of chestnut

                                                  o'er her brow,
                                                  Was the idol I worshiped, even more
                                                  than my God,
                                                  For I thought her as pure as the
                                                  grass I trod.

                                                  met her, one bright Summer day,
                                                  And we strolled to the playground
                                                  for innocent play.
                                                  I thought of the angels in yonder
                                                  fair skies,
                                                  As I gazed with rapture in her
                                                  loving blue eyes.
                                                  

                                                  

                                                  
                                                  That eve I escorted her to her
                                                  beautiful home,
                                                  And there afterwards often with her
                                                  I did roam,
                                                  O'er field and through
                                                  forest, talked love all the while,
                                                  Laid plans for the future, as we
                                                  sat on the stile.

                                                  passed away;

                                                  And a protracted meeting in the

                                                  Where we gathered each evening at
                                                  the chime of the bell.

                                                  ne'er can forget;
                                                  Its memory celestial hovers over me
                                                  yet,
                                                  For down at the altar, in penitent
                                                  prayer,
                                                  Miss Anna, my darling, was kneeling
                                                  there.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  A feeling o'erpowered me I
                                                  ne'er can express,
                                                  A feeling of sorrow, regret, and
                                                  distress;
                                                  For if Anna was sinful, O God! what
                                                  was I?
                                                  A sinner unsaved, doomed forever to
                                                  die.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Then forth to that altar, with a
                                                  penitent heart,
                                                  I went; knelt down, my sorrows to
                                                  impart
                                                  To Him who, on Calvary's
                                                  accursed tree,
                                                  Paid the debt, and the ransomed
                                                  sinner set free.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Imagine, dear reader, us two
                                                  kneeling there,
                                                  Each begging for pardon in penitent
                                                  prayer;
                                                  We, who loved each other, with our
                                                  burdens of sin,
                                                  Beseeching the blessed Redeemer
                                                  come in.
                                                  

                                                  

                                                  
                                                  Laying all on the altar, with
                                                  sorrowing heart,
                                                  There dawned the bright hope the
                                                  world can't impart.
                                                  Then shouting the praises of our
                                                  Savior dear,
                                                  Vowing ne'er to forget Him
                                                  in coming years.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  As we walked home that
                                                  winter's night,
                                                  'Neath the stars of heaven
                                                  that shone so bright,
                                                  I pledged my love, asked her to be
                                                  mine,
                                                  And make a desolate life
                                                  sublime.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Her answer came, most sweet and
                                                  clear,
                                                  Perfecting hope, diminishing
                                                  fear;
                                                  With proud heart I retraced my
                                                  steps that night,
                                                  With energies renewed,
                                                  life's battles to fight.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  For there, beneath the clear, cold
                                                  sky,
                                                  As the stars looked down with

                                                  Soon after I'd risen from
                                                  sweet repose,
                                                  Then bade adieu to those I loved

                                                  And emigrated to the far, far
                                                  West.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  I found employment in a Texas
                                                  town,
                                                  At thirty per month, the whole year
                                                  round;
                                                  This wrote I to Anna, in a cheerful
                                                  tone,
                                                  Saying, some day I'll give
                                                  you a happy home.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Through four years, all seemed
                                                  going well,
                                                  For each of her letters
                                                  love's secret would tell,
                                                  But now there came a sudden
                                                  change--
                                                  She ceased to write; this seemed so
                                                  strange.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Letters I wrote, but no answer
                                                  came,
                                                  Again and again, the result the
                                                  same;
                                                  To its highest pitch I taxed my
                                                  brain,
                                                  The cause of this freak to
                                                  ascertain.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  I thought of all who used to be
                                                  Confiding friends to her and
                                                  me,
                                                  And from the score or more I
                                                  chose
                                                  A boy by the name of Edward
                                                  Rose.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  So to Edward Rose a letter I
                                                  wrote,
                                                  Requesting all the news afloat,
                                                  And if possible, to write to me
                                                  The whereabouts of Miss Anna
                                                  Lee.
                                                  

                                                  

                                                  
                                                  I waited; alas! 't was all
                                                  in vain,
                                                  To my note of inquiry no answer
                                                  came;
                                                  Wild with anxiety, I determined to
                                                  go
                                                  To the home of my boyhood, the
                                                  truth to know.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  I'd prospered by industry
                                                  in years gone by,
                                                  Since I emigrated west, my fortune
                                                  to try;
                                                  Five long years had almost
                                                  passed
                                                  Since I looked on the face of my
                                                  loved one last.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  So I gathered together my little
                                                  hoard,
                                                  And a lightning express train
                                                  jumped aboard;
                                                  With my heart in doubt,
                                                  'twixt love and fear,
                                                  I reached my home of bygone
                                                  years.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  'Twas night when safely I
                                                  reached my goal,
                                                  By the light of the moon I resolved
                                                  to stroll
                                                  Out o'er the old familiar
                                                  road,
                                                  To the place where love's
                                                  first seed I sowed.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Each scene seemed familiar as
                                                  presented along,
                                                  Sweet thoughts of the past my mind
                                                  did enthrong;
                                                  I walked to the school-house,
                                                  where, in other days,
                                                  I'd pledged
                                                  Love's cause in beautiful lays.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  And close to the door, there
                                                  kneeling down,
                                                  To thoughts of the past did my
                                                  heart rebound;
                                                  Then I breathed a prayer on the
                                                  still night air,
                                                  For many were the joys experienced
                                                  there.
                                                  

                                                  

                                                  
                                                  Thus I sat and soliloquized
                                                  Till illumined with light the
                                                  eastern skies;
                                                  Then I trudged along with the
                                                  morning sun,
                                                  To greet the form of my loved
                                                  one.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  I rapped at the door; in response
                                                  there came
                                                  Her mother, to welcome me home
                                                  again--
                                                  But her manner was strange, her
                                                  welcome cold,
                                                  Her reception indifferent from that
                                                  of old.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  "Where's
                                                  Anna?" I asked, after taking a seat.
                                                  Her mother looked startled, and
                                                  rose to her feet.
                                                  "My daughter's
                                                  now married to a gentleman,
                                                  Since you proved a reprobate, your
                                                  love to disband."
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  "Great God! what is
                                                  this?" I frantically cried;
                                                  "She's not
                                                  married-- you surely have lied.
                                                  Where is she? Please tell me, and
                                                  to her I'll go,
                                                  And from her own lips the truth I
                                                  will know."
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  She showed me the house.
                                                  "I'll go with you,"
                                                  said she.
                                                  "The end of this sad, sad
                                                  drama to see;"
                                                  We entered the threshold, and
                                                  before me there stood
                                                  The pride of my youth, the loved of
                                                  boyhood.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  "Oh, Anna, my darling,
                                                  what's this I see?"
                                                  For a rosy-cheeked baby looked
                                                  smiling at me.
                                                  "Oh, why have you proved
                                                  so false and untrue,
                                                  When my undying love for you you
                                                  knew?"

                                                  said Anna, while tears filled her eye,

                                                  To perfect the torture already
                                                  begun?"

                                                  causing you pain;
                                                  I only came back my jewel to
                                                  claim.
                                                  I never have been married, but,

                                                  "My God! is this true,
                                                  have I been deceived?"
                                                  Said she, of that I could not but
                                                  believe;

                                                  went.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  The messenger told him what had
                                                  occurred;
                                                  "I'll

                                                  demurred."
                                                  All night we waited, beside her

                                                  But there came no sound of the
                                                  husband's tread.

                                                  waited,
                                                  For his return, so long

                                                  From that cup of bitterness, she
                                                  still kept drinking;
                                                  In delirium, she often would loudly
                                                  call
                                                  For me, whom she loved, all in
                                                  all.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Weeks passed away, but no tidings
                                                  came
                                                  Of him, who'd dishonored
                                                  her spotless name;

                                                  The dreaded hour, it came at

                                                  My fondest hopes in life to
                                                  blast.

                                                  arose,
                                                  Her life of bitterness was brought
                                                  to a close.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  After the first wails of grief had
                                                  ended,
                                                  Her funeral, in sorrow, by me was
                                                  attended.
                                                  Then I followed her to that lonely
                                                  cell
                                                  On earth, to bid her a last
                                                  "Farewell."
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  And there, as I stood by that
                                                  silent grave,
                                                  I thought of the many kind words
                                                  she gave;
                                                  And, with words audible only to
                                                  heaven above,
                                                  My poor heart expressed its
                                                  cherished love.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Then, deploringly, I sit me
                                                  down,
                                                  A requiem to chant o'er
                                                  her silent mound;
                                                  Inaudible dirge, yet my pen will
                                                  impart
                                                  The mournful thoughts of my aching
                                                  heart.
                                                  

                                                  

                                                  
                                                  Anna, my loved one, in ethereal
                                                  rest,
                                                  Can you know the sorrow that
                                                  invadeth my breast?
                                                  Can you count the heart-aches,
                                                  enumerate the tears
                                                  Generated from the love of former
                                                  years?
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  The grave may enshroud thee, thou
                                                  fairest of earth;
                                                  Thy innocent sprit of sorrows be
                                                  dearth;
                                                  But, alas! how true, my love must
                                                  invade
                                                  The interior of the tomb, where
                                                  thou art laid.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Though death separates us, for a
                                                  season of time,
                                                  And my sorrow I can not express in
                                                  my rhyme;
                                                  But oh! my loved one, thank God we
                                                  shall meet,
                                                  In the portals of heaven, where
                                                  joy's complete.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Then turning my attention, to the
                                                  said Edward Rose,
                                                  Thought he could some truth, of the
                                                  letter disclose;
                                                  I went to the town, where
                                                  he'd last been seen,
                                                  And a chain of evidence began to
                                                  glean.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  By streak of good fortune, I
                                                  chanced to find
                                                  A friend, with whom Rose had
                                                  recently dined;
                                                  And had made of this man, a
                                                  confident friend,
                                                  Acknowledging, he the forged letter
                                                  did send.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  I followed the base reprobate,
                                                  o'er many long miles
                                                  And found him in thralldom, in
                                                  Mexico's wiles;
                                                  From a poor old planter, he had
                                                  stolen a horse,
                                                  And 'neath a leafy gibbet,
                                                  he stood in remorse.
                                                  

                                                  

                                                  
                                                  The saplin bowed down, its burden
                                                  to bear,
                                                  And soon his body was suspended in
                                                  air;
                                                  Then they wrote his accusation,
                                                  with spirits elate,
                                                  And left him alone, to his
                                                  long-deserved fate.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Then I thought of the words, our
                                                  Father hath said,
                                                  "Suffer all things calmly,
                                                  I'll avenge you instead;"
                                                  Vengeance will o'ertake
                                                  the sinner in time,
                                                  For the Lord hath said truly,
                                                  "all vengeance is mine."
                                                  
                                        
                                        

                                        

                                        

                                        

                                                  THE HAVEN OF MY HEART.

                                                  
                                                  MY own
                                                  dear, quiet home,
                                                  The haven of my heart;
                                                  Why need I from thy covert roam
                                                  To seek where love impart?
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  For beneath thy cope a flower
                                                  Averts the direful blast,
                                                  But quaves the foliage of the
                                                  bower,
                                                  Then sweeping, harmless, past.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  A mystic shield, which God
                                                  alone
                                                  Can solve its sovereign power,
                                                  Wards the missiles from my

                                                  Polluted it like gold by brass,
                                                  With some debase exhausting
                                                  gas.

                                                  Alas! since we are prone to

                                                  To blow the coals of
                                                  others' strife,

                                                  And squirmed upon his chair;

                                                  Upon the darkness there.

                                                  But chewed and chewed his cane.

                                                  Than o'er their path its
                                                  mimic rose;
                                                  A pole that reached from side to
                                                  side,
                                                  Ambushed in the gloaming tide.
                                                  Midway he stood, with vague
                                                  import,
                                                  As if the air was firm support;
                                                  And waved on high his rustling
                                                  trail,
                                                  Like a bark with stately sail.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  A deep groan fell upon their
                                                  ears,
                                                  Which bound the host in panic
                                                  fear.
                                                  Near overhead, in white, there
                                                  stood
                                                  The dreaded ghost of
                                                  Miller's wood.
                                                  As they writhe in dumb despair,
                                                  He waves his Siva spear in air,
                                                  Essays to spring upon his prey,
                                                  Who scatter, scream, and flee
                                                  away.
                                                  
                                                  


                                                  
                                                  

                                                  
                                                  
                                                  ARGUMENT.
                                                  DESCRIPTION OF
                                                  MILLER'S COVE.


                                                  BILLY
                                                  Host, relating the scene of the ghost over the
                                                  ravine. Rosy Miller's attempt to allay
                                                  his fear by assuring him there could be no danger:
                                                  But dared not disclose the secret of her
                                                  father's schemes.
                                                  

                                                  

                                                  
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  CANTO SECOND.
                                                  
                                                  NOW
                                                  Miller's place was a lovely scene,
                                                  With flowery gardens richly
                                                  green;
                                                  The cot stood low in a grove of
                                                  pine,
                                                  And bore the caressing
                                                  ivy's twine;
                                                  The sloping hills and the level
                                                  plain,
                                                  That stretched away to the forest
                                                  main,
                                                  Gave entchantments ineffably
                                                  grand,
                                                  To the eye, which the vision
                                                  spanned.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  A tenant lived a luxurous life,
                                                  Amid the scenes of daily
                                                  strife,
                                                  With his wife and daughter
                                                  Rose,
                                                  Who caught her share of festive
                                                  beaux.
                                                  Upon this place, long did he
                                                  lave,
                                                  And for its rent small pittance
                                                  gave;
                                                  Here a jealousy arose:
                                                  Some envied him his sweet
                                                  repose.
                                                  

                                                  

                                                  
                                                  From fear that others would be
                                                  impelled,
                                                  To rent the lands he long had
                                                  held,
                                                  Transformed himself into a
                                                  ghost,
                                                  Of all the direful friends the
                                                  most;
                                                  A white sheet o'er his
                                                  shoulders spann'd,
                                                  With wooden fork held fast in
                                                  hand,
                                                  Became the haunt of
                                                  Miller's wood,
                                                  Which deeply roused the
                                                  neighborhood.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Now, in the clan was Billy
                                                  Host,
                                                  Whom Rosy Miller favored most,
                                                  Who had seen the frightful
                                                  fiend
                                                  In mid-air o'er the
                                                  ravine,
                                                  And told the startling news to
                                                  Rose,
                                                  Abruptly pausing at its close;
                                                  And vengeance swore if
                                                  e'er he should
                                                  Meet that ghost of
                                                  Miller's wood.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  The lady gave a mocking smile,
                                                  Which pierced poor Billy's
                                                  heart awhile;
                                                  He little dreamed the spectral
                                                  His lady darling knew so well.
                                                  With loving words and caresses
                                                  dear
                                                  She essayed to calm his fear;
                                                  Gently smoothing back his
                                                  crest,
                                                  She drew his head against her
                                                  breast.
                                                  

                                                  

                                                  
                                                  "No harm could here betide,"
                                                  she warned.
                                                  He the cheering idea scorned;
                                                  No hope assuaged the flaming
                                                  fear
                                                  That kindled deep its embers
                                                  there,
                                                  And as he pressed her hand,
                                                  "Adieu,"
                                                  Again she mocked his phantomed
                                                  clue,
                                                  And bade good cheer to crown his
                                                  way,
                                                  As homeward turned he lone to
                                                  stray.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  And the lady sighed:
                                                  "Though I love him well,
                                                  My father's scheme I dare
                                                  not tell:
                                                  That's wrapped the
                                                  neighborhood in maze,
                                                  And down on Miller's place
                                                  they gaze;
                                                  Its fiat of fate-- ah! who can
                                                  tell?
                                                  But all is well that endeth
                                                  well."
                                                  And closing her eyes, on her downy
                                                  bed

                                                  BILLY
                                                  Host, from fear, arms himself, and goes to call on
                                                  Rosy Miller, but on his way he meets the ghost,
                                                  and from the discharge of his weapon, inflicts a
                                                  severe wound in its side. The object sank to the
                                                  earth with an alarming scream, which he recognized
                                                  as the voice of his lady love. She had contrived
                                                  this plan for a bit of sport, to attest his
                                                  threats. Billy tears the winding sheet from her
                                                  form, and supposing he has slain Rosy, raises the
                                                  alarm. A company assembled at the scene. He
                                                  informs them, he is the murderer. They see the
                                                  sheet and suppose him to be the haunt of the wood.
                                                  They seize him and hang him in the grove: then
                                                  flee, seizing up the prostrated form of the girl,
                                                  whom they suppose dead, and carry her to her home;
                                                  explain to her parents the sad fate, and how they
                                                  had hung the ghost, who slew her. Now the
                                                  neighborhood was rid of its raving fiend.
                                                  Whereupon the mother explains that her husband
                                                  alone was the spectre of the cove. Derides her
                                                  husband. Lays the curse of the two murders upon
                                                  his head.

                                                  And all the fabled yarns renew,

                                                  His heart would leap into his
                                                  throat,
                                                  At the glimpse of sheep or
                                                  goat;
                                                  And oft at shadows in the
                                                  heath,
                                                  His weapon clutched with bated
                                                  breath.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  At last he came to
                                                  Miller's grove,
                                                  His pathway wound about the
                                                  cove,
                                                  Listening with detective ear,
                                                  To faintest sounds, both far and
                                                  near;
                                                  With a step as soft as the fiend of
                                                  death,
                                                  He groped his way by the tangled
                                                  heath,
                                                  Where shadows in the evening
                                                  light,
                                                  Held the gloominess of night.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Up rose the ghost, with ghastly
                                                  form,
                                                  Which thrilled the youth with dire
                                                  alarm.
                                                  One moment paused, enthralled with
                                                  fear,
                                                  The ghost approached few paces
                                                  nearer.
                                                  Demeanor silent, aught
                                                  despaired,
                                                  The silver ball which he
                                                  prepared,
                                                  To pierce the demon of the
                                                  cove,
                                                  If e'er across his path
                                                  should rove.
                                                  

                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Crack went the gun, the phantom
                                                  fell,
                                                  But with a scream he knew quite
                                                  well;
                                                  For oft, in festive gayeties,
                                                  Freighted with sweet melodies,
                                                  Instinctively alone could know
                                                  That love-tone, in a voice of
                                                  woe
                                                  Which thrilled his being with
                                                  dagger's pang:
                                                  His heart sank low, while the
                                                  forest rang.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Bounding, he reached the fallen
                                                  maid,
                                                  Across his lap her form he
                                                  laid,
                                                  And tore away the ghost of
                                                  alarm,
                                                  As her life-blood streamed
                                                  o'er hand and arm.
                                                  He called her name, but she could
                                                  not hear.
                                                  Then on her face fell his burning
                                                  tear;
                                                  To staunch her life-stream hard he
                                                  tried,
                                                  But the pulse flowed fast from her
                                                  wounded side.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  He called aloud; his tones of
                                                  woe
                                                  Prolonged the hills and rocks
                                                  below:
                                                  The small village clustered
                                                  there
                                                  Caught the echoes of despair;
                                                  Went bounding up the narrow
                                                  way,
                                                  A score of men that spurned
                                                  delay,
                                                  Bounding from the dark ravine,
                                                  Stood gazing on a dreadful
                                                  scene.
                                                  

                                                  
                                                  
                                                  There, bending o'er her
                                                  pallid breast,
                                                  Stifled words, with groans
                                                  oppressed,
                                                  Fell from the trembling lips of
                                                  grief
                                                  Upon the one on hazard's
                                                  reef.
                                                  A moment's pause, to list
                                                  his wail,
                                                  As always will, truth told her
                                                  tale;
                                                  In startling accents, heavily
                                                  fell
                                                  The murderer's tones upon
                                                  the spell.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  "Oh, Rosy dear! My only
                                                  one!
                                                  Forgive this deed, so rashly
                                                  done;
                                                  Oh, speak, my darling! Say you
                                                  forgive:
                                                  My life I'd give, could
                                                  you but live.
                                                  But speak one word! my life, my
                                                  all,
                                                  I'd give to hear one
                                                  whisper fall:
                                                  Or from your hand the pressure
                                                  feel,
                                                  Which to my heart, would sweetly
                                                  keel."
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  The crowd which stood in silence
                                                  near,
                                                  Kenned the scene, which palled
                                                  their fear;
                                                  And heard his lips the truth
                                                  disclose,
                                                  In one rash moment anger rose;
                                                  There laid the sheet, the spectral
                                                  pall,
                                                  Embossed with blood, that told it
                                                  all;
                                                  This was the ghost of the
                                                  ravine,
                                                  And some fair one his prey was
                                                  slain.
                                                  

                                                  

                                                  
                                                  They seized and bore him to a
                                                  slope,
                                                  And made the sheet his hanging
                                                  rope;
                                                  Elastic sapling bending
                                                  o'er,
                                                  Received its victim stained with
                                                  gore;
                                                  With a plea of innocence,
                                                  His last faltering breath was
                                                  spent;
                                                  Like sheep that flee at dire
                                                  alarm,
                                                  They bore away poor Rosy's
                                                  form.

                                                  Miller's place,
                                                  Her parents read her ashen
                                                  face,
                                                  And list with awe their hasty
                                                  tale,
                                                  Where they heard a sad bewail,
                                                  And, coursing to incessant
                                                  sound,
                                                  The wizard of the wood they
                                                  found,
                                                  Bending o'er its bleeding
                                                  prey.
                                                  His spectral garb was torn
                                                  away.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  How they bore him to the slope,
                                                  And noosed the sheet, the
                                                  hangman's rope,
                                                  He owned he was the murderer;
                                                  That sad mistake did it incur.
                                                  But the ghost of Miller's
                                                  place,
                                                  With sheety form and baleful

                                                  who was hung, still survives. He meets a stranger,

                                                  of Rosy Miller. A desperate conflict ensues. The
                                                  stranger gains his confidence. He tells him of the

                                                  And hung me in the sloping
                                                  cove.
                                                  The knot was treacherous; down I
                                                  sped,
                                                  And for a while I thought me
                                                  dead;
                                                  Then, groveling back, I found

                                                  Her form away from its pool of
                                                  gore.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  I've watched yon village
                                                  burying ground,
                                                  But there they've never
                                                  laid her down;
                                                  Oh, stranger, find her grave for
                                                  me,
                                                  Ere I must reap my penalty!
                                                  Then o'er her grave just
                                                  once to weep,
                                                  Then my doom would gladly reap;
                                                  Oh, stranger, go search far
                                                  an' near !

                                                  THE
                                                  fisherman's cabin along the river. A
                                                  stranger who had been stopping with the fisherman
                                                  for a few weeks, indulging in the sports of
                                                  hunting and fishing along the river, rows his
                                                  shallop to the shore one evening, with a fine lot
                                                  of trout he had caught a few miles up the stream.
                                                  Relates the success he had had in
                                                  Miller's cove, and the sight he had
                                                  witnessed. The fisherman lets the knife and
                                                  half-scaled fish fall from his trembling hand,
                                                  unnoticed. The stranger knew from this that there
                                                  was a secret relation regarding the language of
                                                  Billy Host, in Miller's cove, whom all
                                                  supposed to be dead, and since Rosy Miller had
                                                  recovered, were haunted by the rashness of their
                                                  dark crime, and supposed it was his ghost, instead
                                                  of the man that roamed the forest. Smitten with
                                                  remorse, and fear of penalty of death, all had
                                                  left except Tom, the fisher, who, in the hope of
                                                  obtaining forgiveness from the ghost, presents
                                                  Rosy Miller to the stranger, and has the pleasure
                                                  of seeing Rosy Miller and Billy Host meet in the
                                                  cove, after each supposing the other to be dead.

                                                  Adown the stream from
                                                  Miller's wood;
                                                  The door on rusty hinges swung,
                                                  And April winds through crevices
                                                  sung;

                                                  plain to see,
                                                  Could scarce afford a canopy;

                                                  A fisherman returning there,

                                                  And he told me his secret of ten
                                                  years' rove."
                                                  

                                                  

                                                  
                                                  Like one that is palsied,
                                                  Tom's hand shook,
                                                  Until the half- saled fish fell
                                                  into the brook;
                                                  His knife fell from his lenient
                                                  hand,
                                                  The stranger heeled it into the
                                                  sand;
                                                  "Oh! what was the secret
                                                  the ghost disclosed?
                                                  Was there any crime of the past
                                                  exposed?
                                                  Did he a name of a hand
                                                  embrace,
                                                  That hung the ghost of
                                                  Miller's place?"
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  "Yes," said the
                                                  stranger, "he spoke your
                                                  name."
                                                  "'T is a
                                                  lie!" said Tom, his eyes aflame.
                                                  "To censure me you will
                                                  not dare"
                                                  He stooped for his knife, but it
                                                  was not there.
                                                  Ah! that ghost, with inaudible
                                                  tread,
                                                  Hath stolen your fallen blade and
                                                  fled;
                                                  Stands gazing yonder, with mocking
                                                  eyes,
                                                  Behind a shadow of the
                                                  evening's skies.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  "Oh, save me! save me! if
                                                  he's taken my knife

                                                  life.

                                                  Whose hands, with mine, bent low

                                                  We ruthlessly hung him upon the
                                                  scene
                                                  Where we found him bending
                                                  o'er Rosy's form.
                                                  For a trick she had played she long
                                                  must mourn."
                                                  

                                                  

                                                  
                                                  The stranger asked, "Does

                                                  That ghost hath searched for her

                                                  On the graveyard urns, where the
                                                  dead are lain.
                                                  If you a recompense would give

                                                  A distant cottage soon was
                                                  seen,
                                                  Dimly in the twilight sheen;
                                                  Tom rapped the door, but in rude
                                                  haste,
                                                  Winged the threshold ope a

                                                  lost one's face."
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  The dew was scarcely drank away
                                                  On that exhilarating April day,
                                                  Than speeding down the pass there
                                                  came
                                                  The stranger, Tom, and the loving
                                                  dame.
                                                  She called aloud; the forest
                                                  rung,
                                                  And mingling echoes backward
                                                  flung.
                                                  "Billy! Billy!"
                                                  she shouted shrill;
                                                  Her voice rang clear on the breezes
                                                  still.
                                                  

                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Billy came rushing through the
                                                  heath alone;
                                                  In a dying wail he had heard that
                                                  tone;
                                                  He waved a welcome to the flying
                                                  maid,
                                                  And friends of yore meet in the
                                                  glade.
                                                  They speechless meet, but heart to
                                                  heart
                                                  They clasp each other, and warm
                                                  tears start;
                                                  A symbol of which alone can be
                                                  When we meet our lost in
                                                  eternity.
                                                  
                                                  

                                                  

                                        

                                        
                                                  THE LOVE OF SONG.

                                                  
                                                  IF in one
                                                  troubled grief-swept breast
                                                  I should still a cord of woe,
                                                  And hush it to authentic rest,
                                                  That only woe-crushed hearts may.
                                                  know.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Or, for life's stern
                                                  battle field,
                                                  One faint heart I should make
                                                  strong;
                                                  To Thee, my God, my praises
                                                  yield,
                                                  For the precious gift of song.
