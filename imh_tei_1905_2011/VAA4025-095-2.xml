            <p>In early June, 1781, in one of his last official acts as governor of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, Thomas Jefferson thanked his "brother" Jean Baptiste Ducoigne, the
                    leader of the Kaskaskias, for his visit to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> and called for continued peace and friendship between their peoples. Three years
                    earlier George Rogers Clark had seized the old French settlement at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kaskaskia</settlement>

                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>'s jurisdiction through the <placeName>

                    </placeName> country. An aggressive British presence in <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s control, however, forcing the Americans to enlist as many Indian allies in the region
                    as possible. "I have joined with you sincerely in smoking the pipe of peace,"
                    Jefferson told Ducoigne, "it is a good old custom handed down by your ancestors, and as
                    such I respect and join in it with reverence. I hope we shall long continue to smoke in friendship
                    together…. We, like you, are Americans, born in the same land, and having the same
                    interests." The most compelling "interest" of all true
                    "Americans" was the elimination of British influence in the backcountry.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shortly after meeting with Ducoigne, Jefferson retired from office and began writing his <hi rend="i">Notes on the State of <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                        </placeName>
               </hi> (1785). Celebrating his state's glorious prospects, Jefferson offered a
                    powerful rebuttal to the claims of the Comte du Buffon and other European natural philosophers that
                    the New World's inferior natural endowment inevitably led to the degeneracy of animal species,
                    including humans. Toward the end of a long section on <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>'s "Productions, Mineral, Vegetable and Animal" (Query VI), Jefferson
                    described the natural genius of the continent's indigenous peoples, echoing the benevolent
                    sentiments of his address to the <placeName>

            <p>Uncorrupted by civilization, native Americans reflected man's true nature. Their "keen
                    sensibility," affection for their children, capacity for "strong and
                    faithful" friendship, and unsophisticated "moral sense of right and
                    wrong" preserved social order without compulsion or coercion.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> For
                    Jefferson the Indians were natural republicans who showed that society did not depend on submission
                    to the authority of a governing class but was instead the spontaneous expression of man's sociable
                    nature.</p>
            <p>Despite the implied invitation to Ducoigne and other Indian leaders, Jefferson's generous assessment
                    of Indians' human potential did not lead to the construction of a durable multi cultural political
                    order in the New World. On the contrary, Jeffersonian "philanthropy" provided the
                    moral and intellectual rationale for the removal of Indians across the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> under President Andrew Jackson.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> When Jefferson celebrated the
                    human potential of native peoples, he embraced the binary opposition of "savagery"
                    and "civilization," situating Indians at an earlier stage of historical
                    development and displacing them from the present moment. In fact, the Indian population of the
                    settled region of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> was at its lowest ebb since the advent of English settlement. Receding across space,
                    Indians, like the artifacts Jefferson assiduously collected, seemed to be relics of a distant
                    past—or perhaps of his own childhood.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> For the time being, of course,
                    native peoples such as the Kaskaskias remained a vital and strategically important presence in the
                    hinterland. But Jefferson anticipated that the same historical drama would be enacted in the West
                    that he and his forefathers had witnessed in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>In stipulating a universal human nature, Jeffersonians explained cultural differences in terms of a
                    grand historical narrative, with mankind moving progressively from a savage to a civilized state. In
                    September, 1824, less than two years before his death, Jefferson looked back on the "march
                    of civilization advancing from the sea coast" westward, a movement that would inevitably
                    consign Indians to the dustbin of history, unless they joined the white man's world: <quote rend="blockquote">

                    years later. Progress exacted human costs that the sentimental Jefferson was prepared to acknowledge
                    "with the commiseration their history inspires," for the Indians,
                    "endowed with the faculties and the rights of men," remained an example for
                    American republicans, even as they resisted white encroachments: <quote rend="blockquote">

                    </quote> Of course, civilization of the natives proved to be an elusive goal. Indeed, Jefferson
                    suggested that the Indians best expressed their true nature—their fundamental equality
                    with Europeans—by resisting and falling before the torrent of white migration, a great
                    natural force that cleared the way for civilization.</p>
            <p>The American Revolution was pivotal in the grand sweep of Jefferson's historical narrative. It gave
                    birth to a new American people who were entitled, as Jefferson proclaimed in the Declaration of
                    Independence, "to assume among the powers of the earth" a "separate and
                    equal station" and who could rightfully claim lands bartered away by Indian peoples.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> "You find us, brother, engaged in war with a powerful
                    nation," Jefferson informed Ducoigne in 1781. The war had started "as a family
                    quarrel between us and the English, who were then our brothers." We began as a single
                    people, Jefferson declared, whose "forefathers were Englishmen, inhabitants of a little
                    island beyond the great water…. Being distressed for land," the first Virginians
                    exercised their natural right of emigration "and settled here…. As long as we
                    were young and weak," Jefferson explained, "the English whom we had left behind,
                    made us carry all our wealth to their country, to enrich them; and, not satisfied with this, they at
                    length began to say we were their slaves, and should do whatever they ordered us." The
                    Revolution was set in motion by this betrayal of familial ties. Although they were "grown
                    up and felt ourselves strong," the Americans resisted the final break. They finally were
                    forced "to renounce for ever these unfeeling brethren," as Jefferson had written
                    in his original draft of the Declaration, when the English made war on them, "the last stab
                    to agonizing affection." But, Jefferson <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Jefferson's conception of Virginian and American nationhood assumed a fundamental relationship
                    between a particular people and its territorial domain. As Jefferson explained in his <hi rend="i">Summary View of the Rights of British America</hi> (1774), royal assaults on <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>'s charter boundaries and changes in land policy that retarded the transfer of crown
                    lands to private hands had been major causes of discontent in the Old Dominion. Paradoxically,
                    Jefferson and his fellow Virginians invoked the inviolability of the 1609 <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> charter, a grant from the English king Charles I, in resisting later encroachments of
                    English kings on their territorial rights. The premise of their reading of the old charter, which
                    had long since been vacated, was that it definitively gave this vast domain to the first settlers
                    and their descendants.</p>
            <p>Virginians argued that if their charter rights were subject to amendment or revocation through
                    subsequent grants, then they were not, properly speaking, rights at all. The territorial issue was
                    thus defined in dichotomous terms: the king was either completely free to distribute property and
                    establish governments where property had not yet been vested in private individuals and where no
                    existing colonial government exercised effective jurisdiction; or he was bound to respect the
                    corporate rights of colonies under charters, construed as contracts or constitutions, and therefore
                    could not exercise his authority within those charter limits in any way that violated the people's
                    present rights or legitimate future expectations. Jefferson made the point succinctly in the <hi rend="i">Summary View:</hi> "kings are the servants, not the proprietors of the
                    people." George III did not own <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, even if ungranted lands in the colony were "crown lands" and were
                    customarily distributed through the agency of royal government. "He has no right to grant
                    lands of himself," declared Jefferson. "From the nature and purpose of civil
                    institutions, all the lands within the limits which any particular society has circumscribed around
                    itself, are assumed by that society, and subject to their allotment only."<hi rend="sup">10</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The gravamen in Jefferson's argument was that Virginians constituted a "people" in
                    history, having in the past entered into a contractual agreement with the king and looking to the
                    fulfillment of the contract's terms in the future. The king virtually disappeared in this
                    formulation. Indeed, it was the Virginians who, by assenting to the charter, set their own limits
                    and so perfected their claim to "all <list type="footnotes">

                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> an historic pedigree that justified (or disguised) its revolutionary act of
                    self-creation. Sublimated in a myth of national origins, this idealized and radically limited
                    conception of monarchical authority provided Jefferson and his republican colleagues with a
                    compelling standard against which the king's abuses could be measured. The charter could then be
                    read as a kind of constitution in which a people secured royal recognition of its preexisting
                    rights. Jefferson's story of voluntary expatriation, whereby Englishmen came to the New World at
                    their own expense and without sacrificing any of the rights they had enjoyed at home, made <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Thus the vast territory defined by the charter became the Virginians'
                    "country," with the claims of native proprietors disappearing along with those of
                    the king. This was no coincidence, for Jefferson and his fellow Virginians saw the pretensions of
                    George III and his native allies as inimical to their new republic's vital interests.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>

            <p>Late in life, Jefferson still cherished childhood memories of visits by the "great Outassete
                    [i.e., Outacity], the warrior and orator of the Cherokees" to his father's home and later
                    to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Williamsburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> when Jefferson was studying at William and Mary. Outacity's "sounding voice,
                    distinct articulation, animated action, and the solemn silence of his people at their several fires,
                    filled me with awe and veneration," Jefferson told John Adams in 1812, "altho' I
                    did not understand a word he uttered." Jefferson then "acquired impressions of
                    attachment and commiseration for them which have never been obliterated."<hi rend="sup">12</hi> As Jefferson matured, Indian eloquence acquired new meanings, most famously in the lament
                    of the Mingo chief Logan, whose family allegedly had been "murdered… in cold
                    blood" by Colonel Michael Cresap in the spring of 1774. Logan's speech, addressed to
                    Governor Dunmore, and memorialized in Jefferson's <hi rend="i">Notes</hi>, struck the tragic note
                    that shaped Jefferson's understanding of the Indians' fate. Logan (speaking of himself in the third
                    person) had been "a friend of white men" but was now resigned to his own imminent
                    death. "He will not turn on his heel to save his life. Who is there to mourn for
                    Logan?—Not one."</p>

                    whose eloquent appeal went straight to the heart. But it was the content of Logan's speech,
                    lamenting his family's and his people's displacement and demise, that moved Jefferson. When he

                    "uncultivated people who exemplified the natural virtues of the human race in its
                    "childhood." So, too, Jefferson would remember his own childhood, before the

            <p>As governor and president, Jefferson addressed Indian leaders as "brothers" or
                    "children," invoking the traditional language of frontier diplomacy. Fictive kin
                    relationships integrated European and American sovereigns into the complex and shifting system of
                    alliances and obligations that linked Indian peoples. The paternalistic Jefferson was less sensitive
                    to the diplomatic dimension of "family" ties in Indian country than to the way
                    that reliance on such ties demonstrated the natives' pre-political, childlike condition.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> Jefferson's famous celebration of Indian virtues in the <hi rend="i">Notes</hi> was predicated on "the circumstance of their having never submitted themselves
                    to any laws, any coercive power, any shadow of government," because without recourse to
                    "laws" and "government" Indian societies remained small they
                    also remained virtuous: "their only controuls are their manners," Jefferson wrote,
                    "and that moral sense of right and wrong, which, like the sense of tasting and feeling, in
                    every man makes a part of his nature." Among the Indians, offences could only be
                    "punished by contempt, by exclusion from society, or, where the case is serious, as that of
                    murder, by the individuals whom it concerns." Yet the result was not the
                    anarchy—the imagined war of all against all—that certain social contract
                    theorists invoked to justify the coercive authority of the early modern state. On the contrary,
                    Jefferson suggested, the natural affection and sociability that sustained peace and harmony in
                    "lawless" Indian communities constituted an attractive alternative to coercive
                    state power. It might well be asked "whether no law, as among the savage Americans, or too
                    much law, as among the civilized Europeans, submits man to the greatest evil." As

                    voted for lawlessness: "the sheep are happier of themselves, than under care of the

            <p>The logical corollary of Jefferson's familial conception of Indian society was that it could not
                    survive over an extensive domain. "The Savages" recognized instinctively
                    "that great societies cannot exist without government" and "therefore
                    break them into small ones."<hi rend="sup">16</hi> But these small, self-contained family
                    societies were poorly equipped to resist the encroachments and seductions of powerful European and
                    American neighbors. The Indians could only sustain their way of life as long as they had access to
                    the vast supply of undeveloped land that a primitive, hunting economy required and that isolated
                    them from each other and the world. Jefferson's Edenic view of indigenous societies thus reinforced
                    his sentimental identification with the Indians even as it explained and justified their
                    displacement.</p>
            <p>But there was trouble in paradise, and not simply because of the encroachments of the modern world.
                    Jefferson's idealized account of the Indians' society-without-government reflected the profound
                    ambivalence at the core of his sentimental politics. First, the choice between "too much
                    law" and "no law" was not a genuine one for Americans, who were supposed
                    to submit happily to laws of their own making under their new republican governments. As an
                    enlightened republican, Jefferson was the enemy of despotic rule, where law was the command of
                    supposedly superior beings, but not of "great societies." The revolutionary
                    challenge was to perfect republican governments that would preserve liberty—and the
                    sanctity of republican families—while enabling Americans to participate in, and
                    contribute to, the progress of civilization. For Americans this meant that they should establish
                    more perfect unions, thus expanding the sphere of their republican empire, not retreating into a
                    more primitive, isolated, and lawless state. Under republican governments, the rule of law defined
                    and protected the domestic sphere, securing the ambit of natural virtue and sociability that proved
                    so vulnerable for the Indians.</p>
            <p>Indian lawlessness did not reflect any natural incapacity. As Jefferson assured his friend Marquis de
                    Chastellux, the Indian was "in body and mind equal to the whiteman."<hi rend="sup">17</hi> Yet, despite their natural genius, Indian men would resist the regime of law because of
                    their profound attachment to male prerogatives. If Indian men were natural republicans, exhibiting

                    brutal sort. The very premise of Indian culture, the regime of the "manners" that
                    preserved order in their lawless societies, was male supremacy, a "perversion" of
                    the consensual conjugal union that constituted the foundation of a just and lawful social order.<hi rend="sup">18</hi> Jefferson's belief in the capacity of individual Indians for civil life thus
                    justified his unwillingness to recognize the collective rights of Indian communities, for these
                    communities were based on force, not consent. Tragically, brave Indian men demonstrated this
                    capacity for reason and choice in their willful resistance to white civilization. The tragedy was
                    not simply that such resistance was hopeless, but that Indians chose to defend unnatural
                    prerogatives, not natural rights.</p>
            <p>Indian men could only be virtuous, and only then in their relations with one another, when they were
                    left alone. In Jefferson's view, any form of social or political organization among the Indians that
                    American revolutionaries encountered could only reflect the demoralizing effects of contact with
                    Europeans. Far from promoting the progress of their civilization, adaptations to European diplomacy
                    and warfare stripped Indians of their natural virtues, transforming them into the
                    "merciless Indian Savages" Jefferson excoriated in the Declaration. The natives'
                    moral degradation was a function of their unnatural dependency on an English
                    "father" who had betrayed his children, red and white. But while American patriots
                    resisted George's tyranny, standing up for their rights and assuming the "separate and
                    equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them," their native
                    "brothers" served as the mindless instruments of the king's wrath, rioting

                    "brothers" born in the same land, indistinguishable from whites in their
                    "uncultivated" state, and, in their perverse and stubborn opposition to the
                    progress of civilization, too different to be welcomed into the family of nations. In more benign

                    Jefferson told his childhood friend John Page in August, 1776, Congress was justified in
                    "pushing the war into the heart of their country." But Jefferson would not be
                    satisfied with a mere reprisal that was proportionate to the original injury. "I would

            <p>Like their loyalist counterparts, Indians who served as pawns of British power forfeited their
                    natural place in the new republican dispensation. As fellow "Americans" they
                    should have joined the resistance against a despotic authority, eschewing the corrupt enticements of
                    treaty agreements that deepened their dependency on English weapons and trade goods. Under the
                    bastard political forms that flourished in Indian country during a century of imperial conflict,
                    Indians had failed to develop the civil institutions that would have sustained their collective
                    moral development. The history of the Indians thus offered a dark counterpoint to Jefferson's grand
                    narrative of the progress of white civilization across the continent: their trajectory moved in the
                    opposite direction, from a regime of natural virtue and sociability to the degradation and
                    dependency that contact with European powers entailed. When they looked westward, Americans
                    therefore did not simply encounter an earlier version of themselves; they encountered instead the
                    perverse and corrupt forms that "civilization' would take under the aegis of despotic
                    power, an image of their own future should their struggle for independence fail.</p>
            <p>Jefferson thus offered a counter-narrative to the story of New World degeneracy told by Buffon and
                    Raynal that vindicated the Indians' natural potential as fellow human beings, condemned the
                    corruption of despotic imperial regimes, and identified the fatal weaknesses of Indian societies.
                    The degraded condition of indigenous peoples in Spanish America who had "passed through ten
                    generations of slavery" offered the most poignant testimony to the human costs of despotic
                    rule. Insult compounded injury when natural philosophers such as Buffon, basing their judgments on
                    reports of recent travelers, mistakenly concluded that humans, like other species, degenerated in
                    the New World. Species did not degenerate on this side of the Atlantic because of the debilitating
                    effects of the environment; they were sustained, as Jefferson showed in the Notes, by an
                    extraordinary natural abundance. If the native inhabitants were in such a degraded condition, it was
                    because of their contact with European "civilization." As Jefferson told
                    Chastellux, it was "very unfair… to judge of the natural genius of this race of
                    men" on the basis of the corrupted <list type="footnotes">

                    assembled a vast collection of word lists that could provide philological clues to Indian

                    generation; he has neither hair nor beard, and nor ardor whatever for his female." In fact,
                    Jefferson retorted, the Indian "is neither more defective in ardor, nor more impotent with
                    his female, than the white reduced to the same diet and exercise." Nor was the Indian woman

                    Indian women "produce and raise as many children as the white women," Jefferson

                    preference for hunting over agriculture, made Indian societies weak and vulnerable to European and
                    American encroachments. As president, Jefferson never tired of preaching to his Indian

                    have been sufficient incentive to abandon their primitive ways, liberate their women from
                    "drudgery," and build farms. Indian men in their natural state were far from

            <p>Indians were fully the equals of Europeans in possessing and expressing the social virtues that
                    formed the foundation of the new republican social order. But living in small-scale familial
                    societies, these natural republicans had never developed the legal institutions or cultivated the
                    respect for the law that enabled civilized republicans to extend their empire across the continent.
                    The greatest obstacle to their civilization was the Indians' exploitation of their women. Although
                    they happily lacked the means for the tyranny that characterized the despotic regimes of the Old
                    World, Indian men inflicted an "unjust drudgery" on their women. In this crucial
                    respect, among "every barbarous people… force is law." As a man who
                    admired the natives' manly virtues, Jefferson might well prefer a regime of "no
                    law" where "the stronger sex… imposes on the weaker" to the
                    universal oppression of "too much law." But Jefferson recognized the injustice of
                    this primal form of domination. "It is civilization alone which replaces women in the
                    enjoyment of their natural equality," he wrote in the Notes. If the absence of despotic
                    government over men made Indian societies seem more "natural" to Jefferson, the
                    oppression of Indian women clearly violated their natural rights and showed why the progress of
                    civilization was a moral necessity. "Women are formed by nature for attentions,"
                    he later asserted, "not for hard labor." By this exalted standard, Indian
                    societies, despite their apparent virtues, were fundamentally flawed.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Jefferson's account of gender relations provides the crucial pivot in his broader discussion of the
                    future of native peoples on the American continent. When Jefferson shifted his gaze from manly
                    virtues to female oppression, the terms of his analysis reversed: it was native, not European,
                    societies that exhibited the most fundamental reliance on the rule of force. Indeed, from this
                    perspective, the rough equality that prevailed among Indian men was merely adventitious: lacking the
                    political means to enforce their will on one another, they were forced to act as if they respected
                    each other's rights. If under such circumstances Indian men developed "a male, sound
                    understanding" that counseled prudence and circumspection in their dealings with other men,
                    however, their moral capacity remained radically undeveloped, for it was the women who served as
                    moral exemplars and arbiters in civilized societies. Civilization "teaches us to subdue the
                    selfish passions," Jefferson asserted. By restraining their licentious impulses to exploit
                    powerless dependents, civilized men learned "to respect those rights in others which we
                    value in ourselves." Jefferson's celebration of Indian society and his moral indictment of
                    European despotism thus gave way to his more profound identification with the great struggle of
                    civilization against savagery. 'Were we in equal barbarism" <list type="footnotes">

                    would be equal drudges." This was not only a contest for possession of a continent, but a
                    struggle for the "natural equality" of the sexes in a virtuous republican regime
                    that would foster mankind's moral development.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indian societies were like republican families in their reliance on persuasion and affection to
                    sustain harmonious social relations. But it was the radically defective constitution of Indian
                    families, with men exercising brute force over women, that stunted the moral and political
                    development of Indian societies. Lacking a sense of the "rights of others" that,
                    for civilized Europeans, began at home, Indians were incapable of looking beyond the particular to
                    see themselves as part of a "great society" that could secure reciprocal rights
                    and benefits for an expanding population. Habituated by their domestic tyranny over women to confuse
                    force and law, Indian men could not imagine their own submission to a regime of law as anything less
                    than dishonorable and degrading, even if it was grounded in consent.</p>
            <p>The proud independence of Indian men constituted the most formidable obstacle to the assimilation of
                    indigenous peoples in republican society. Those cultural traits that some Americans professed to
                    admire in the natives—the "ardent love of liberty and independence"
                    that Jefferson memorialized in his Second Inaugural—were, paradoxically, those traits
                    that guaranteed their demise. With "no desire but to be undisturbed," natives
                    resisted those changes—from hunting to agriculture, from oppressing women to recognizing
                    their just claims—that would have promoted not only the growth of population but, more
                    importantly, the moral and political development that would enable them to participate as equal
                    partners in the expansion of the Americans' new empire of liberty.<hi rend="sup">29</hi> Thus, while
                    the Americans declared their independence from Europe in order to promote the progress of
                    civilization, Indians fought a hopeless rearguard action against the future, identifying their own
                    independence with a barbarous regime that retarded the population and prosperity of the western
                    world. The tragic outcome of this struggle was predetermined by willful Indian men who refused to
                    allow their peoples to fulfill their human potential.</p>
            <p>The whites' great advantage in displacing Indians from their aboriginal homes was demographic. With
                    every succeeding generation the American population doubled, increasing the pressure of settlement
                    to the West even as the Indians' numbers—and their ability to resist—dwindled.
                    But this progress, however certain in the long run, was subject to obstacles and reverses,

                    believed would ultimately guarantee the Indians' demise made them dangerous enemies in war. Their
                    hunting, bellicose culture may have oppressed women, retarded population growth, and prevented moral
                    and political progress in Indian societies, but it also produced formidable warriors. Insufficiently
                    domesticated by female influence, impatient with and contemptuous of the rule of law, Indian men
                    were vulnerable to European corruption. As they exchanged their services as mercenaries for
                    essential material support, these wilderness aristocrats—a leisured, warrior class that
                    traditionally lived off the labor of oppressed women—became increasingly dependent on
                    their European masters. Proud and independent Indians were thus transformed into Jefferson's
                    "merciless Savages," ruthlessly efficient tools of ministerial corruption.</p>
            <p>When Jefferson contemplated Indians at war, as he did throughout the Revolution and its protracted
                    aftermath, the image of wilderness aristocrat obliterated the natural republican he had invoked in
                    his polemic against the degeneracy thesis of Buffon and Raynal. This degradation was cultural and
                    historical, Jefferson insisted, the final sad effect of the "barbarous perversion of the
                    natural destination of the two sexes" in Indian societies. As long as the Indians remained
                    immune to Europe's corrupting influence, the effects of this "perversion" were
                    mitigated by the small scale of their societies and the inability of savage men in their natural
                    state to tyrannize each other systematically. But competing European imperial powers solved the
                    problem of scale for Indian warriors, providing both the armaments that only advanced commercial
                    societies could produce and the political resources of "great societies" that
                    could exercise authority over extensive empires. As Jefferson wrote in April, 1788, while traveling
                    in the French countryside, "every Indian man is a soldier or warrior, and the whole body of
                    warriors constitute a standing army, always employed in war or hunting. To support that army, there
                    remain no laborers but the women. Here, then, is so heavy a military establishment, that the civil
                    part of the nation is reduced to women only."<hi rend="sup">30</hi>

                    compared to the patriotic mobilization of citizen-soldiers in defense of their own families and
                    communities. For Jefferson, the "half-way pacifist," defensive war was always

                    tradition, there was a fundamental difference between citizens who became soldiers in times of local
                    and national emergency and a "standing army," hireling soldiers such as those
                    "foreign Mercenaries" George III had sent to America "to compleat the
                    works of death, desolation and tyranny." When "merciless Indian Savages"
                    served as mindless tools of British despotism, the worst of two worlds converged, threatening to
                    retard and reverse the progress of republican civilization across the continent.<hi rend="sup">33</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For Jefferson the familial forms that governed Indian diplomacy and made European sovereigns into
                    "fathers" of dependent native peoples represented another, more dangerous
                    manifestation of the fundamental flaw of Indian societies, the tyranny of Indian men over their
                    women. Where later generations of historians have recognized that the elaboration of these kinship
                    connections constituted creative intercultural adaptations to the changing balance of power in
                    Indian country, Jefferson could see only the debasement and corruption of family values.<hi rend="sup">34</hi> Indians were bound to transgress the sacred boundaries of family life, the
                    moral foundation of civilized societies, precisely because their families were founded on the rule
                    of force, not love. Thus, at the very moment that patriotic Americans were overthrowing monarchy and
                    aristocracy—the perverted forms of familial rule that retarded the progress of political
                    civilization in the Old World—Indian peoples embraced new, more degrading forms of
                    dependency as the "children" of European despots.</p>
            <p>During wartime Jefferson's most immediate and compelling concern was with the military threat that
                    Indian enemies presented to vulnerable frontier settlements. But his apparently paradoxical account
                    of Indian strength and weakness—a formidable fighting force that lived off the dwindling
                    resources of demoralized and depopulated communities—pointed to a more pervasive threat.
                    The Indians' ultimate removal may have been inevitable, but the actual sequence of events that led
                    to that outcome would leave an indelible imprint on the western landscape. The great fear shared by
                    Jefferson and like-minded colleagues was that competition for Indian lands among the American states
                    and private land companies, as well as between the new nation and its imperial neighbors, would,

                    vision of prosperity for "our descendants to the thousandth and the thousandth
                    generation," they also dazzled speculators with the possibility of landed properties that

                    domain the Indians relinquished hinged on the transactions, violent or peaceful, that led to their
                    removal. The question for Jefferson and his followers was not whether in the process justice would
                    be done to native proprietors, but rather whether the Americans, in resolving their own conflicts
                    over jurisdiction and property rights, would lay the groundwork for the expansion of republican
                    institutions or for a counterrevolutionary, aristocratic revival.<hi rend="sup">36</hi>

            <p>The future of the West posed a series of related problems. First, the new American union had to
                    resolve the conflicting jurisdictional pretensions of its members, potentially the most divisive and
                    destructive legacy of the old imperial regime. Jefferson and his fellow Virginians insisted that the
                    other states would have to recognize the integrity and inviolability of their commonwealth's
                    colonial charter claims, the same demand they had made on George III; for their part, the Virginians
                    "ceded, released, and forever confirmed" to the peoples of neighboring states the
                    Virginian territory that had been granted to them by subsequent charters.<hi rend="sup">37</hi> To

                        titles had been liquidated: "That the lands of this country were taken from them by
                        conquest, is not so general a truth as is supposed. I find in our historians and records,
                        repeated proofs of purchase, which cover a considerable part of the lower country; and many more
                        would doubtless be found on further search." In his original manuscript, Jefferson
                        acknowledged that "these purchases were sometimes made with the price in one hand and
                        the sword in the other." But more transactions set a higher standard, perhaps
                        indicative of the Virginians' moral progress: "The upper country we know has been
                        acquired altogether by purchases made in the most unexceptionable form." TJ, <hi rend="i">Notes on the State of <placeName>

                    state bloc in Congress: land speculators who based their claims to western property on treaties or
                    private purchases from the Indians that disregarded <placeName>

               </placeName>, and
                    other states. To advance their own interests, aspiring aristocrats would recklessly put the
                    Revolution itself at risk. But this was not surprising, after all, for all of the great land
                    speculations could be traced back to the colonial era, when prominent politicians on both sides of
                    the Atlantic combined forces to grab large chunks of Indian country. Perhaps these silent English
                    partners lurked in the background, exercising a corrupt influence that was manifest in land company
                    machinations. Perhaps the ostensible patriots who claimed to lead the companies would benefit from
                    the failure of the Revolution, particularly if <placeName>

                    </placeName> and the other landed states succeeded in vindicating their charter claims, disallowing
                    prior grants and purchases, and preempting future encroachments.<hi rend="sup">38</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The western lands controversy thus reinforced the Virginians' fundamental understanding of the
                    Revolution as the vindication of the corporate rights of the peoples of British America, defined by
                    their charters, against the assaults of a corrupt metropolitan government that was beholden to the
                    selfish private interests of speculators and financiers. As the controversy unfolded, however, the
                    implications of that understanding became increasingly complicated and confusing. In 1776
                    enthusiastic patriots might well imagine that "killing the king" would inaugurate
                    the republican millennium. But such hopes were all too soon dashed: the removal of the king simply
                    meant that corruption would take on new, more insidious forms. Under the influence of the land
                    companies, corrupt congressmen would argue that the <placeName>

                    </quote> By this jurisdictional legerdemain, Congress would take the place of the king, using its
                    property to spread its influence among a new class of supposedly republican courtiers and retainers;
                    a new metropolis would emerge, subjecting the American provinces, stripped of their rights, to its
                    despotic rule. In resisting these assaults on their vital interests, Virginians learned that
                    counterrevolutionary threats were pervasive, even among those Americans who most loudly professed
                    their patriotism. It was a lesson that would shape the responses of Jefferson and like-minded <placeName>

                    </placeName> patriots to the dangers of "consolidation" in decades to come.</p>
            <p>Concerns about the consolidation of power at the center were inextricably linked to anxieties about
                    how that power would be exercised on the peripheries of the new republican empire. To prevent an
                    aristocratic revival it was essential that republican governments act as careful stewards of the
                    public domain. The great challenge was to liberate landholdings from the incubus of feudal tenures,
                    enabling free men to enjoy genuine independence on their own properties. Looking back on the
                    headright system of early <placeName>

                    </placeName> (under which, supposedly, land was distributed to free white settlers), and looking
                    forward to rising generations of young republicans spreading across the hinterland, Jefferson saw
                    the West as a vast reservoir of free land, unencumbered by the fraudulent titles that proliferated
                    under a corrupt ministry. Jefferson's hostility to feudal tenures, and the aristocratic rule that
                    they supported, provided the ideological justification for overlooking the imperfect forms of
                    "property" that covered the West in the wake of imperial rivalries, land
                    speculation, and the opportunism (or desperation) of native peoples. His vision of a "fee
                    simple empire" was the radical republican counterpoint to a British imperial regime that
                    threatened to transplant feudal corruption to the New World, and so reverse the proper course of
                    world history.<hi rend="sup">41</hi>

                    Jurisdictional confusion in the West was exacerbated in the last decade of imperial rule by a

                    British authorities reduced their "gifts" or subsidies to Indian clients even as
                    they sought to exploit new sources of revenue in the coastal colonies. Meanwhile, settlers and
                    speculators pushed aggressively against the successive boundaries—beginning with the
                    Proclamation line of 1763—that were supposed to restrain westward settlement. The
                    escalating costs of negotiating and enforcing these boundaries led imperial authorities to delegate
                    increasing responsibility to the colonial governments, subverting any possibility of effective,
                    centralized rule in Indian country. It was against this background of imploding imperial authority
                    and proliferating claims in backcountry that Virginians projected their own exclusive territorial
                    right to the vast domain defined by the 1609 charter.<hi rend="sup">42</hi>

                    and insupportable Tyranny" of George III, but the king's corrupt influence was most
                    immediately and dangerously present in the machinations of royal officials in America and their
                    Indian clients. For republican Virginians, the "covenant chain" that linked the
                    English king to his native children was recast as a chain of corruption, which was the epitome of an
                    unnatural aristocracy. In exchange for patronage and protection, servile and dependent Indians
                    bartered away their dubious and at best imperfect rights to western lands, providing the putative
                    source for the many title claims that threatened to deprive future generations of Virginians of
                    their patrimony. Conspiring against the property rights of a free and independent people, the king
                    and his Indian clients, the highest and the lowliest, were slavishly interdependent. When the war
                    came and the king's character and intentions stood revealed, it was hardly surprising to Jefferson
                    that the English tyrant's "Savage" tools should descend on the American frontiers
                    in a frenzy of "undistinguished Destruction."<hi rend="sup">44</hi>

            <p>Jefferson's language in the Declaration seems intemperate to modern commentators, striking a note
                    that hardly resonates with the philosophical and philanthropic views eloquently expressed in the <hi rend="i">Notes</hi> and in his addresses to Indian leaders. But the animus in the Declaration
                    was directed against a corrupt imperial regime that had reduced so many natives to their present
                    pathetic state, not against the Indians who might still be found in their
                    "natural" condition or in their reformed state if they submitted to the new
                    republican dispensation. The frightening scenes Jefferson conjured in the Declaration revealed
                    profound anxieties about the king's awesome power to mobilize so many auxiliaries in his assault on
                    American liberties: from "large Armies of foreign Mercenaries," to
                    "merciless Indian Savages," to "fellow-subjects" allured by the
                    prospect of the "forfeiture &amp; confiscation of our property," to the
                    enslaved Africans who labored on <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>'s plantations. This ever-tightening circle of despotism, culminating in George's
                    instigation of murderous slave revolts, shaped Jefferson's dark image of the British Empire on the
                    eve of American independence.<hi rend="sup">45</hi> Whatever Americans might declare, this empire
                    was not about to whither away but was pervasive, reaching through porous frontiers into the
                    neighborhoods of treasonous "fellow citizens" and into the homes of patriot
                    planters.</p>
            <p>In some fundamental sense Jefferson may have been expressing anxiety about his own virtue, or more
                    plausibly about the virtue of his countrymen. How else could the toryism of so many Americans be
                    explained? But Jefferson was less concerned with character defects than with the corrupt foundation
                    of the imperial constitution: the inequality of persons, classes, and communities that fostered
                    dependency and servility and produced so many willing tools of despotic rule. Thus for Jefferson the
                    crucial republican premise was equality. Within <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> this meant the dismantling of primogeniture and entail, the legal props of a landed
                    aristocracy, where families—and generations—were unequal; it also meant that
                    the new state's public domain should not be encumbered by the claims of court favorites,
                    speculators, or their Indian clients, but should be broadly distributed on equal terms to all of <placeName>

                            wisely provided for the direction of the interests of society," thus replacing the
                            "aristocracy of wealth" that had flourished under British rule. Before
                            independence "the transmission of [landed] property from generation to generation
                            in the same name raised up a distinct set of families who, being privileged by law in the
                            perpetuation of their wealth were thus formed into a Patrician order, distinguished by the
                            splendor and luxury of their establishments. From this order too the king habitually
                            selected his Counsellors of State, the hope of which distinction devoted the whole corps to
                            the interests &amp; will of the crown." TJ, <hi rend="i">Autobiography</hi>

                    </placeName>'s public domain depended in turn on the constitution of a new American union that was
                    purged of all monarchical forms and influences. The new states all must be republican, independent
                    of each other and the world, yet bound together in a perfectly harmonious and consensual union. Just
                    as consent among individuals was only possible where they were truly equal, so too states in union
                    must be equal. The British imperial regime prior to independence seemed deeply flawed, not only
                    because of the dangerous concentration of power in the metropolis, but equally because of the wide
                    diversity of colonial governments and jurisdictions through which Britain ruled America.
                    "Divide and rule" was the ministry's motto: distinctive
                    "constitutions," overlapping boundaries, and competing interests would keep
                    provincial Americans at each other's throats—and guarantee the supremacy of a corrupt
                    ministry.</p>
            <p>Jefferson and fellow defenders of <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s claims insisted that the states must enjoy a territorial monopoly in the union,
                    precluding any jurisdiction by a less than equal, less than fully republican government that would
                    concentrate power dangerously in the central government. Provision for the creation of new and equal
                    republican states in the hinterland, as required by the state land cessions to Congress, meant that
                    the federal government would never be able to develop a system of colonies or client states in the
                    West that could be mobilized against the original members of the union.<hi rend="sup">47</hi> This
                    determination to prevent the emergence of a powerful metropolitan government meant that there was no
                    political space for native peoples within the new American empire. Adroit negotiators in the
                    diplomacy of the imperial regime, Indians were too prone to seek corrupt, unequal
                    advantages—"gifts," subsidies, and military aid—that would
                    make genuine union impossible; lacking the attainments of political civilization, native peoples
                    were incapable of forming true republican governments and therefore of meaningfully consenting to
                    any durable engagements.</p>

                    terms. In other words, Congress announced that any political arrangements short of statehood would
                    be temporary: direct rule by Congress in the "territorial" phase would give way to
                    republican self-rule; implicitly, any recognition of Indian rights under treaties also was
                    understood to be provisional, subject to future negotiations that would guarantee the land's highest

            <p>Congress's reliance on state titles logically culminated in the "conquest theory,"

                    more authority in Indian country than the British "father" had ever claimed before
                    American independence. But Congress did not stake out this ultimately untenable position on its own
                    behalf. On the contrary, because the conquest theory was premised on the sufficiency of the state
                    titles, it preempted politically controversial counterclaims from other sources, most notably from
                    Congress itself as the successor to the British crown's jurisdiction in the West. Accepting all

                    collectively in the new national domain. The conquest theory fully accorded with these political
                    imperatives. In effect, the Confederation government promised not to pursue an independent policy
                    with the Indian tribes that, through the process of treaty negotiations, could provide a plausible

                    The need for a settlement offered eloquent testimony to the weakness of an
                    "imbecilic" union teetering on the verge of collapse. But while resolution of the

                    defied geopolitical realities in Indian country. Abandoned by their British protectors, the tribes

                    </placeName> in 1782 and their concerns were not heard in Congress when the states resolved their
                    differences and charted the future of the West. The Indians' absence was no coincidence but rather
                    the essential condition for bringing these negotiations to a successful conclusion. For it was only
                    by ignoring the indigenous peoples that the American states could assert their collective claims
                    against the other sovereignties of the world and simultaneously reconcile their own conflicting
                    claims without risking a dangerous concentration of power in Congress. Not surprisingly, the logic
                    of these settlements was lost on the Indians. Indeed, the combination of extravagant American
                    pretensions, articulated in the conquest theory, and the new nation's obvious weaknesses as a
                    military "power" set the stage for a series of disastrous and humiliating
                    setbacks. The Americans could not have devised a surer means to promote a belligerent, pan-Indian
                    mobilization, even among tribes that had allied with them, or remained neutral, during the
                    Revolution.</p>

                    much bigger stick than the old Congress, the Federalists negotiated reasonable treaty settlements
                    with the Indians, one of their most important achievements in consolidating the new nation's
                    position in a dangerous world.<hi rend="sup">53</hi> But the emerging Republican opposition was
                    skeptical about Federalist Indian policy, and not simply because early military setbacks offered
                    plausible targets for partisan sniping. Sniffing "consolidation" in every shifting
                    breeze, Republicans feared that the administration would make unacceptable concessions to the tribes
                    and to their British sponsors in order to pacify the frontier: recognizing Indian rights through
                    treaties could subvert the carefully crafted territorial settlement on which the federal union

                    For Taylor, this arrangement was the very image of imperial corruption and the antithesis of the
                    republican union of equal states that Americans had sought to create in 1776 and perfected through
                    the resolution of the western lands controversy.</p>
            <p>The Federalists had no intention of winning the war in the West. Invoking a favorite theme in
                    Republican rhetoric, Taylor juxtaposed the effectiveness of citizen-soldiers, fighting for their
                    homes and families, with a corrupt and dangerous "standing army." Frontier
                    self-help, a few "incursions of mounted riflemen," and the rapid distribution of

                    aflame. "An expensive and unsuccessful war," Taylor wrote, "may cultivate
                    the public mind into a willingness to treat away this territory to the Indians." As a
                    result, the conditions of <placeName>

                    Public lands would not be sold at reasonable prices to industrious settlers, thus helping to
                    discharge the nation's revolutionary debts, nor would frontier settlements be formed into new
                    states, "in faithful compliance with the solemn compacts long since entered into with the
                    ceding states." Scarcely a financial boon, the national domain would instead be a constant
                    drain on the Treasury and a justification for higher taxes. "Nothing is wanting to
                    consummate the system," Taylor concluded, "but a relinquishment of the right of

                    duly confirmed by the Senate, were to enjoy the exalted status of treaties, there was nothing to
                    stop the administration from "dismembering" the states: "from the power
                    of making treaties, a power of dismembering a state has been deduced and exercised. And a power of
                    dismemberment, is evidently equivalent to a power of annihilation." Indian treaties
                    subverted the union—by encroaching on the states' territorial rights or violating the
                    "solemn compacts" in state land cessions that provided for the creation of new
                    states—and invested the tribes with political and property rights under the law of

                    great Republican majority from its forgetful slumbers, teaching vigilant voters to see dangerous
                    patterns in apparently disconnected policies: Americans should be prepared to play their patriotic
                    part when a "long train of [Federalist] abuses" finally forced them to reenact the
                    Revolution. Taylor exposed the nefarious initiatives of the "paper junto," the
                    incipient aristocracy of security holders—"the 5000"—who
                    sought to exploit and impoverish the great mass of the people—"the

                            ever obstructs mankind in pursuit of competency and happiness, because by compressing them
                            within the locality of their devices, they are more easily brought to the magical mint, and

                    encroaching upon the barbarians," the Federalists were encouraging "the barbarians
                    to encroach upon us;… instead of procuring safety," so-called "treaties
                    of peace" proved to be little more than "annual supplies of arms, ammunition and
                    clothing to the enemy;… instead of securing the territories, acquired in a time of
                    comparative weakness and distress," the administration was "surrendering [them] to

                    themselves." To do so, Taylor predicted, "those who call themselves

                    Meanwhile, the administration negotiated treaties that promised the removal of British forts from

                    respectively. Under these new circumstances, it was no longer clear that the "intrepid
                    republicans" of the new settlements, the chief beneficiaries of these diplomatic successes,
                    would rally behind the Republican opposition. But Taylor's evocation of an aristocratic conspiracy
                    against states' rights and republicanism would leave its imprint on the "Jeffersonian
                    Persuasion," both in the dark days immediately ahead and in the party's triumphant revival
                    in the election of 1800. The lurid details of Taylor's dire predictions about the future of the West
                    were less important than the underlying conception of the union that he drew from Jefferson and his

                    </placeName> patriots.</p>
            <p>Jefferson's vision of republican empire, an empire without a powerful metropolis or an aristocratic
                    ruling class, provided the conceptual framework for Taylor's gloomy scenario of corruption and loss.
                    Growing out of the defense of <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s charter claims, Jefferson's ideas about states' rights and union had always been
                    subject to challenge, whether from the British crown, "merciless Savages," land
                    speculators, or corrupt congressmen; in the 1790s the ascendant Federalists showed how an energetic
                    central government, raising the cry of national security, could so easily subvert federal union and
                    republican liberty. Yet the people came to their senses in the epochal election of 1800,
                    rehabilitating republicanism by routing the aristocratic Federalists.</p>
            <p>The American people had attested to their "federal and republican principles,"
                    Jefferson exulted in his Inaugural Address. The "empire of liberty" would now
                    expand westward, liberated at last from the incubus of aristocracy. "Kindly separated by
                    nature and a wide ocean from the exterminating havoc" of the Old World, Americans happily
                    possessed "a chosen country, with room enough for our descendants to the thousandth and
                    thousandth generation." The Indians who had loomed so large in Taylor's vision of a
                    shrinking West, dismembered by treaties and parceled out in corrupt new
                    "principalities," simply disappeared in Jefferson's optimistic account. But this
                    was precisely the point: however formidable their warriors might be, Indian
                    "nations" were mere shadows, the tools of corrupt European paymasters, incapable
                    of exercising any real power of their own. Without the artificial support of the British Empire or
                    of Federalist administrations, the Indian threat would quickly dissipate. Like Federalist leaders
                    who had been abandoned by enlightened voters, the Indians were suddenly rendered impotent and
                    harmless; like a standing army, deprived of royal patronage, the 'barbarians" could only
                    retreat. They were no match for "the strongest Government on earth… where every
                    man, at the call of the law, would fly to the standard of <pb n="132" id="VAA4025-095-2-036"/> the
                    law, and would meet invasions of the public order as his own personal concern."<hi rend="sup">61</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Jefferson could afford to ignore the Indians because of the diplomatic and military successes of
                    Federalist administrations, not because voters had finally come to their senses and purged the
                    federal republic of dangerous aristocratic and monarchical tendencies. Americans owed their reprieve
                    from diplomatic and military entanglements to a brief interval in the European wars, not to the
                    irresistible power of citizen-soldiers. But Jefferson struck a responsive chord when he
                    congratulated his fellow Americans on the vast arena open to their enterprise. The absence of
                    Indians in his account was testimonial to a powerful new sense of the new nation's manifest destiny,
                    held in check throughout the 1790s by the ascendancy of aristocratic Federalists.</p>
            <p>Jefferson's vision of continental greatness represented the convergence of two distinct, but
                    interdependent, historical narratives. By redeeming their republican experiment in the
                    "Revolution of 1800," Americans rejoined the story of their revolutionary struggle
                    against British tyranny with the larger story of civilization's westward progress. If the Revolution
                    failed, a possibility that seemed increasingly likely to Republicans during the 1790s'
                    "civilization" necessarily would take a radically different course. Keen students
                    of the new "science of politics," republican theorists recognized that there was a
                    dangerous discrepancy between the progress of civilization generally and the development of
                    enlightened political regimes: aristocratic and monarchical elements constituted archaic survivals
                    in European regimes that jeopardized their stability and prosperity. Through the degradation and
                    enslavement of native peoples, these regimes could extend their sway through the American
                    hemisphere, throttling the natural development of republican institutions.</p>
            <p>In both of Jefferson's stories, converging in the Inaugural Address's triumphant vision of a dynamic
                    and expansive republican empire, Indians played roles that disgraced and dishonored their natural
                    gifts. The only hope for the individual Indians was that they follow the arduous path toward
                    republican civilization; they must abandon political pretensions that made them dependent on corrupt
                    imperial patrons and retarded their moral development. With the war for the West apparently won, the
                    philanthropic Jefferson was prepared to teach his Indian children how they too could become
                    Americans.</p>
            <p>Jefferson did not hate Indians. Instead, he hated their degraded condition under the pernicious
                    influence of America's antirepublican enemies; it was George III, after all, who turned the natives
                    into "merciless Savages." After his inauguration in 1801, the new <list type="footnotes">

                    Indians. The balance of power now decisively favored the Americans; with European powers no longer
                    offering critical support, dwindling numbers of Indians were no match for the rapidly growing
                    American population. "You see that we are as numerous as the leaves of the trees,"
                    Jefferson told one Indian leader in 1808, "strong enough to fight our own battles, and too
                    strong to fear any enemy."<hi rend="sup">62</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Americans' numerical preponderance was so great that the Indians would never again be able to
                    intervene in the new nation's conflicts with neighboring imperial powers. Toward the end of his
                    second term, when chronic conflict over maritime rights threatened war with <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, Jefferson told the northwestern Indians that though the English were "strong
                    on the water," they were "weak on the land." The Indians should play no
                    role in this looming conflict: "we do not ask you to spill your blood in our
                    quarrels," nor, he added ominously, "do we wish to be forced to spill it with our
                    own hands." His meaning could not be mistaken: "the tribe which shall begin an
                    unprovoked war against us, we will extirpate from the earth, or drive to such a distance as that
                    they shall never again be able to strike us." Jefferson's chilling warning recalled his
                    revolutionary rage against the "savages" and undoubtedly betrayed similar
                    anxieties. But the message's tone was calculated and confident, with professions of friendship
                    balancing threats. Jefferson presented a stark choice to his native "children" so
                    that they would learn an important lesson: Indians must abandon war if they ever hoped for the
                    peace, prosperity, and population growth that would make them a "great nation."<hi rend="sup">63</hi>

            <p>The British were responsible for chronic warfare in the Northwest, Jefferson told another group of
                    chiefs. "While we were under that government," before independence, "we
                    were constantly kept at war with the red men our neighbors." Then many tribes fought

                    only be explained by outside interference. Their British allies and patrons were not the Indians'
                    true friends, for they fomented the chronic conflicts that led directly to the depopulation and
                    demoralization of their communities. "Now, my children," the paternalistic
                    president exhorted, "if we wanted to diminish our numbers, we would give up the culture of
                    the earth, pursue the deer and buffalo, and be always at war; this would soon reduce us to be as few
                    as you are, and if you wish to increase your numbers you must give up the deer and buffalo, live in

            <p>Constant warfare led to a massive sacrifice of Indian peoples, not only of the young warriors wasted
                    in battle, but of future generations as well. Indians need only look across the frontier, to the
                    rising tide of white settlement, to see the future they were forfeiting by holding fast to their
                    savage way of life. "What a brilliant aspect is offered to your future history, if you give
                    up war and hunting," exclaimed Jefferson, and "adopt the culture of the earth and
                    raise domestic animals; you see how from a small family you may become a great nation by adopting
                    the course which from the small beginning you describe has made us a great nation."<hi rend="sup">66</hi> Jefferson invoked two related themes as he urged his native
                    "children" on toward civilization. Only by turning to agriculture would Indians be
                    able to sustain an enduring relation to their country, "the earth which covers the bones of
                    your fathers," and therefore to their own past; only by making farms, by growing instead of
                    wasting children, could they hope for a future.<hi rend="sup">67</hi> The choice lay with the

                    real enemy, not American armies or the legions of white settlers that followed in their wake. And if
                    the Indians should succumb to this enemy, if these refractory "children" should
                    spurn their father's teaching, it would be their own responsibility.</p>
            <p>Jefferson's presidential addresses to the Indians offered a self-righteous justification for an
                    expansionist territorial policy that would set the stage, within less than two generations, for
                    Jackson's removal policy. The inexorable progress of civilization absolved Americans of agency or
                    moral responsibility for the displacement of indigenous peoples; in stark contrast, the Indians did
                    face choices and were responsible for their own fate. Professing solicitude for the welfare of his
                    red children, the white father could offer them little protection from the expansion of settlements
                    and the penetration of market forces. Jefferson argued that Indian peoples could only benefit by
                    submitting to the discipline of the market, paying their debts to merchant creditors, and exchanging
                    portions of their vast land reserves for the capital needed to make farms. White settlers' land
                    hunger thus was not a threat but a resource Indians should exploit: "Our people multiply so
                    fast that it will suit us to buy as much as you wish to sell," Jefferson told the Chickasaw
                    chiefs in 1805, and "if at this time you think it will be better for you to dispose of some
                    of them to pay your debts, and to help your people to improve the rest, we are willing to buy on
                    reasonable terms."<hi rend="sup">70</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The self-serving logic of the addresses provided the ideological rationale for an expansive
                    republican empire. But Jefferson did not consciously seek to deceive or defraud his native charges,
                    and if he was manipulative in his dealings with them, he was equally so with his own children.<hi rend="sup">71</hi> Everything he said in his messages to the Indians <list type="footnotes">

                    use, they might improve and secure the remaining land. Becoming good husbands, Indian men would reap
                    bountiful harvests and father many children; learning to live under laws of their own making, Indian
                    communities would become true republics, ultimately merging with white Americans in a single
                    "great nation." If all of these adaptations to republican civilization served the
                    interests of land-hungry white farmers, this was only as it should be in a peaceful and harmonious
                    union of peoples. After all, Jefferson insisted, the assumption of a natural enmity between Indians
                    and white settlers was false, an ugly image from the old regime fostered by generations of imperial
                    warfare and diplomacy. The New World, purged of the Old World corruption that had fostered Indian
                    savagery, presented a different picture. If they did not disappear from view altogether, the Indians
                    would be a part of this picture. This was Jefferson's promise to Captain Hendrick, the Indian
                    leader, in December, 1808: "unite yourselves with us, join in our Great Councils and form
                    one people with us, and we shall all be Americans; you will mix with us by marriage, your blood will
                    run in our veins, and will spread with us over this great island."<hi rend="sup">72</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Jefferson knew that the choice would be difficult. "Are you prepared for this?" he
                    asked the Upper Cherokees when they sought assistance in civilizing themselves, and "have
                    you the resolution to leave off hunting for your living, to lay off a farm for each family to
                    itself, to live by industry, the men working that farm with their hands, raising stock, or learning
                    trades as we do, and the women spinning and weaving clothes for their husbands and
                        children?"<hi rend="sup">73</hi> For Jefferson the choice itself, not federal
                    patronage, was crucial. The real American Revolution would come to Indian country when Indian men
                    renounced their "aristocratic" prerogatives, elevated women to their naturally
                    equal position, and provided for the welfare of future generations. The first challenge was to have
                    children at all: Indian men should know that their "savage" way of life was a form
                    of generational murder against unborn children, a criminal waste of the male potency and female
                    fertility Jefferson celebrated in his <hi rend="i">Notes.</hi>

            <p>Jefferson's addresses to the Indians revealed powerful emotions. Far from cynical productions of a
                    manipulative diplomacy, these addresses were heartfelt testimonials to the principles on which, he
                    believed, the new American regime was founded. As they asserted their rights and declared their
                    independence, Americans acted as moral agents, following the precepts of natural law. The Revolution
                    was lawful, not licentious; republicanism represented the high achievement of a civilized people,
                    not a regression to savagery. Jefferson and his fellow patriots provided the freedom and prosperity
                    for future generations by liberating a great continent from monarchy and aristocracy. This great
                    boon, "our country," required great sacrifices in years of bloody warfare. Indians
                    who would share in this magnificent legacy had to change themselves into civilized republicans and
                    good Americans. Their arduous progress, recapitulating the progress of civilization itself, must
                    begin at home.</p>
            <p>Jefferson's sentimental republicanism also began at home, in the idealized domesticity constituted by
                    consensual conjugal union. In his most extravagantly optimistic moments he could envision unions of
                    unions, spreading circle upon circle, layer upon layer, until the whole enlightened world was
                    transformed and redeemed. This republican millennium would be both the culminating moment in the
                    progress of world history and a return to the wholeness and perfection of the family circle. The
                    same pattern of thought can be traced through Jefferson's Indian addresses. When he imagined the
                    reconciliation of the races, the merging of nations into "one people," the old
                    language of Indian diplomacy took on new life for him: Jefferson was no longer a
                    "father" by courtesy or convention, nor were the Indians
                    "children" who would opportunistically adopt and dispose of
                    "fathers" as the balance of forces in Indian country changed. Instead, Jefferson
                    foresaw white Americans and their "red brethren" forming a single great family,
                    connected by the most intimate ties of consanguinity. For the Indians this merging of the races
                    would be at once a moment of their restoration—"peace and agriculture will raise
                    you up to be what your forefathers were"—and their rebirth as Americans. Once
                    "you… possess property" and "live under regular
                    laws," Jefferson said to the Indians, "[you will be prepared] to join us in our
                    government, to mix with us in society, and your blood and ours united will spread over the great
                        island."<hi rend="sup">74</hi>

            <p>In becoming Americans the Indians would regain the continent that their forefathers had recklessly
                    forfeited. Through this same process, the new nation's title to its imperial domain would become
                    perfect: any lingering misgivings about the Americans' claims to their country would be allayed.

            <p>It is tempting to dismiss Jefferson's vision of interracial nationhood. Invoking his own experience
                    and observation of Indian culture and politics, he emphasized the formidable obstacles to its
                    fulfillment in his Indian addresses. Perhaps Jefferson was simply setting the stage for experiments
                    that he knew were bound to fail; he was full of "commiseration" for the Indians
                    but free of any sense of moral responsibility. Yet Jefferson's Indian addresses did speak powerfully
                    to some of the central concerns of his public career and private life. How could the Americans
                    justify their claim to being a distinct people? By what right did they claim the continent as their
                    own? How did native peoples figure in his understanding of the American Revolution? What place could
                    these people claim for themselves in the new republican empire?</p>
            <p>Jefferson never betrayed feelings of guilt about the fate of the Indians. He was more likely to be
                    righteously enraged at their savagery or, in times of peace, philosophically resigned to their
                    cultural resistance. But running through all of his responses was a sense of personal
                    identification, the "attachment and commiseration" evoked by childhood memories
                    that were still vivid in his old age. Perhaps, reasonable men would be inclined to agree, the
                    Indians were doomed to "disappear from the earth." The wish for a different fate
                    for the Indians, the fantasy of a "great island redeemed from European corruption and the
                    savagery it fostered, and nostalgia for lost childhood innocence—all were palpable in
                    Jefferson's romantic image of the millennial moment when, he told the Indians, "your blood
                    will mix with ours" and a truly new nation would emerge.</p>

            <p>Few issues in American history remain as troubling as Thomas Jefferson's toleration of slavery, so
                    clearly inconsistent with his own expressions of man's natural rights. Not only the cruelty but also
                    the manifest injustice of slaveholding detracts from Jefferson's reputation. The terrible irony of
                    his public life was that the very principles he advocated for the design of the new
                    nation—a commitment to majority rule, limited government, the authority of law, and the
                    protection of property right—restrained him in attacking the institution that he knew
                    threatened the American republic. This is not to say, as some have argued, that republican ideology
                    embraced slavery, but that Jefferson's conception of its implementation in the new nation's
                    political and legal institutions precluded aggressive governmental action to emancipate the slaves.
                    Jefferson accepted the "form" of republican government as the only means of
                    securing man's political liberty. This governmental form included a commitment to the rule of law as
                    the basis of both social organization and change.</p>
            <p>Jefferson's belief in the importance of form, evident in his architectural and musical preferences,
                    and even in his personal relationships, is less obvious in his commitment to law as the means of
                    social governance. In this commitment he epitomizes the Enlightenment modernist's acceptance of form
                    as liberalizing. In the same way that the symmetry of Mozart's compositions or the American
                    adaptation of classical columns or friezes reflected the limits upon man's reason posed by taste and
                    judgment, the founding father's dependence upon law reflected a recognition of liberty restrained by
                    the need for social order. Only when the parameters of taste, judgment, order, or virtue were
                    accepted could man truly be free to pursue the limits of his reason. In this way law restrained the
                    policy initiatives that could legitimately be pursued to achieve social goals. As Richard Posner
                    writes, "Systems of thought that emphasize hierarchy, tradition, authority, and precedent
                    disvalue the kind of critical inquiry that tests belief and advances knowledge, and as a result, the
                    truths that <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Jefferson, perhaps more than any of the founding fathers, has had his political motivations, economic
                    status, psychological composition, and personal relationships explored in attempts to explain how
                    the author of the Declaration of Independence could hold slaves. Jefferson's own musings on slavery
                    have been portrayed as rationalizations for his tolerance of the institution. The recent
                    Jeffersonian historiography emphasizes social, economic, and psychological factors, arguing that
                    Jefferson's true motivations were political self-interest, greed, or racism.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> In

                                work on slavery in general, which subordinates ideology to social factors. Gary Nash
                                contends that southern colonists overcame "restraining ideologies" to
                                "develop a labor process unknown in <placeName>

                                gross disparities in wealth that threatened republicanism by subordinating dark-skinned
                                peoples to an underclass, thereby constructing a social equality among the white

                                rationalization for slavery consistent with the paternalistic role that they played in
                                society. The moral obligation of free persons to care for those who could not care for
                                themselves reinforced the holding of slaves as it did the obligation of public service.

                                their actions through the creation of an image of black men and women as evil and
                                oversexed heathens. Racial differences required the exclusion of blacks from education,
                                religious practice, property ownership, and other accoutrements of freedom. Society
                                could then reject them for their cultural failings after denying them the opportunity to

                            <p>According to Davis, "Jefferson had only a theoretical interest in promoting the
                                cause of abolition." Davis attributes Jefferson's position to his political
                                aspirations and his being imbued with the cultural values and beliefs of his society.
                                Abolition had subversive implications, and therefore "it was not accidental
                                that [it was] virtually ignored by Jefferson and the other political leaders who
                                professed an abhorrence of slavery." Davis, <hi rend="i">The Problem of
                                slavery</hi>, 172. Erik H. Erikson's study of Jefferson uses the man as an example of
                                the thought processes of southern slaveholders. Erikson asserts that a lower class was
                                necessary to provide the "negative identity" as a counterpoint to the
                                role to be played by the natural aristocracy. The recognition of people in need of
                                paternal care by their social betters at once legitimized aristocratic involvement in a
                                democratic government and the perpetuation of institutionalized inequality. Erik H.

                                anything, to further the case of abolition. Social considerations as reflected in
                                reputation and lifestyle were paramount. Finkelman finds his subject "more
                                concerned with avoiding irritation [or personal controversy] than he was in promoting
                                emancipation… Jefferson could not maintain his extravagant lifestyle without
                                his slaves and, to judge from his lifelong behavior, his grand style was far more
                                important than the natural rights of his slaves." Paul Finkelman,

                                self-interest as party leader and southerner to limit Jefferson's political options. Don

                                have focused attention away from ideology in attempting to understand their subject's
                                tolerance of slavery. Psychological or social considerations, politics, and economics
                                are used to explain Jefferson's reticence on this issue. Merrill Peterson writes that
                                "neither he nor any other prominent Virginian was ever willing to risk friends,

                        fathers but still acknowledges their good intentions. "If men were evaluated in terms
                        of dreams rather than deeds," he observes, "everyone would concede the
                        antislavery credentials of the Founding Fathers." The founding fathers desired to
                        abolish slavery but were restrained in doing so both by radical sentiments and social-political
                        concerns. "The master passion of the age," Freehling writes, "was not
                        with extending liberty to blacks but with erecting republics for whites," but he does
                        not explain how the pursuit of the latter precluded the former. Most significantly, Freehling,
                        like Fehrenbacher, recognizes the founder's philosophical commitment to property rights as at
                        least equal to the rights of the slaves to liberty. Freehling, "Founding

                        periods of great paradox, as America embraced liberty, political equality, and slavery. He too
                        argues that political, economic, and social exigencies prevented the founders from addressing
                        slavery in the early days of the new nation. Yet Jefferson, Robinson says, was "the
                        only political leader of consequence in Revolutionary America who moved openly against Negro
                        slavery." Robinson reads Query XIV less as a racist diatribe than as a sincere, yet

            <p>Joseph Ellis has commented on the relevance of "ideology" to Jefferson, noting that
                    he "harbored a set of attractive ideals… that he mistakenly believed could be
                    implemented in this world merely because they existed in his head."<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
                    Focusing on ideology as a determinant of behavior broaches the issue: given this set of beliefs,
                    what could the historical actor have been expected to do with regard to a certain issue? Examining
                    Jefferson's toleration of slavery from this perspective may not provide the sole explanation for his
                    seemingly inconsistent position, but it will provide a necessary piece in the attempt to understand
                    and reconstruct this complex historical puzzle.</p>
            <p>Studying Jefferson's approach to slavery from an ideological perspective helps to explain his refusal
                    to work more aggressively for abolition. Jefferson believed that his ideological position inhibited
                    greater action. Because the idea of a social contract involved compromise, the sacrifice of some
                    natural rights was necessary in order to secure others in a societal context. Jefferson's conception
                    of American democracy required that all citizens subordinate themselves to the rule of law. As
                    American law came to embody the values and goals of republicanism, it too served to restrain those
                    who sought to use institutional authority to abolish slavery.</p>
            <p>Jefferson believed in the necessity of a government of laws secured by the Constitution. The law
                    ensured that social policy and change would derive from the expressed wishes of the public by
                    denying the governing elite, however enlightened and wise, the power to dictate policy to the
                    nation. The people should make the laws; likewise, reform in them must result from expressed public
                    opinion. Jefferson wrote that the only way to accomplish the legitimate objects of power was to
                    institute "government by the people, acting not in person but by representatives chosen by
                    themselves—that is to say, by every man of ripe years and sane mind who either
                    contributes with his purse or person to the support of his country."<hi rend="sup">6</hi>

            <p>Despite Jefferson's confidence in the people, he was nonetheless frustrated at times by the
                    impediment to social progress posed by the popular will. Early in his first term as president, he
                    complained, "how difficult it is to move or inflect the great machine of society, how
                    impossible to advance the notions of a whole people suddenly to ideal right."<hi rend="sup">12</hi> However, instead of encouraging him to vest more authority in government, this
                    realization compelled Jefferson to put greater emphasis on education. "I know of no safe
                    depository of the ultimate powers of the society but the people themselves," he wrote,
                    "and if we think them not enlightened enough to exercise their control with a wholesome
                    discretion, the remedy is not to take it from them but to inform their discretion by

                    then education, not tyranny, was the preferred solution. "Laws and institutions,"

            <p>Law could represent the best in man. It could limit the evils that resulted when men, unrestrained by
                    law, exercised their passions, greed, and pettiness in economic or political dominion over others.
                    It could at once serve to ennoble men in their pursuit of virtue while it restrained them in their
                    exercise of selfishness. This two-pronged focus of law as empowering man in the creation of civil
                    society while restraining him in the exercise of his baser instincts is key to understanding how
                    Jefferson's ideology compelled a temporary acceptance of slavery. For it is precisely the need for
                    law to restrain the passions of those without virtue that created a system of laws that could also
                    restrain the most farsighted from effecting major social change. Jefferson's reliance on the rule of
                    law to address society's problems precluded radical solutions inconsistent with existing substantive
                    law. <list type="footnotes">

                    shaped by Enlightenment thought, influenced by legal training and practice, and reinforced by
                    Jefferson's own rationality and dogmatism. Jefferson's adherence to established legal means to
                    address social issues can be seen as a commitment to form over substance that blinded him to the
                    intellectual inconsistency of even the temporary toleration of slavery in a republic committed to
                    human liberty.</p>
            <p>The Enlightenment world view, the context of Jefferson's political ideology, rested on the belief of
                    an ordered universe. Man's nature was a given truth, represented in the inherent proclivities and
                    rights that defined his essence. Winthrop <placeName>
                        <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
                    </placeName> describes the Enlightenment perception of man's rights as absolute: "to know
                    whether certain men possessed natural rights, one had only to inquire whether they were human
                        beings."<hi rend="sup">15</hi> Writing later in life of his peers and himself at the
                    time of the Revolution, Jefferson stated, "We believed… that man was a rational
                    animal, endowed by nature with rights and an innate sense of justice."<hi rend="sup">16</hi> To Jefferson the right to be free to pursue one's own happiness was inherent in human
                    nature. Yet, as human beings existed in a society formed by law, their rights were given meaning
                    only through legal expression. As David Thomas Konig notes, a political contract was necessary to
                    allow humanity to exercise its natural rights, albeit with restrictions necessitated by consent to
                    the rule of law.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>

                    Leaders in the law at the time, such as Jefferson, "were seldom, if ever guilty of

                    relevance of natural law to the slavery debate in the late eighteenth century, Robert Cover finds
                    that natural law ideas were used to judge slavery intolerable in the fifteen to twenty-five years
                    after the Revolution. During this time slavery was abolished in the North and seriously debated in
                    the South. Yet, natural law merely provided principles against which slavery was measured. It was
                    still subordinate to law made by man in constitutions, statutes, and case law precedent. According
                    to Cover, the use of natural law in the slavery debate recognized the gap between law as it was and
                    as it should be.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus an unwritten natural law, in the presence of contradictory man-made law, had little legal
                    relevance outside the realm of theory.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> Konig notes that by the late 1700s
                    natural law "had little or no practical force in American jurisprudence."<hi rend="sup">22</hi> Natural law reflected the natural rights of slaves to liberty and political
                    equality. To deny these rights in the late eighteenth century was a moral wrong, but to assert them
                    was to contravene positive man-made law. Moreover, that same man—made law also recognized
                    the rights of people—the slaveholders-and established protections for them.</p>
            <p>The distinction between natural law and a separate body of law governing man in the polity is best
                    seen in the perceived necessity, amounting to what one commentator described as a
                    "compulsive mania," for constitutions.<hi rend="sup">23</hi> Constitutions
                    recognized the need to form a body of laws to govern a civil society. While natural law embodied
                    eternal truths in the theoretical realm of the state of nature, positive law governed man's social
                    interactions in the polity, in which liberty was restrained by social duty. No society ever existed,
                    nor ever could exist, in which all of one's natural liberties were freely exercised.</p>

                  <hi rend="sup">21</hi> An example of how natural law offered only theoretical guidance is
                        presented by Cover in contrasting St. George Tucker's role as professor of law at William and
                        Mary with his subsequent duties as judge. As a professor, Tucker once sent an essay to the <placeName>

                        natural right of freedom. Ten years later, while seated on the <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                        </placeName> Supreme Court in review of George Wythe's decision in <hi rend="i">Hudgins v.
                            Wright</hi>, he was unwilling to apply natural law or even to consider positive law so as to
                        recognize an implicit incorporation of natural rights. Tucker reversed Wythe, who found that the
                        "free and equal" clause in the <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                        </placeName> constitution made all men in the state presumptively free. Wythe asserted a
                        specific positive law was necessary to overcome the presumption. Tucker refuted Wythe's argument
                        as inconsistent with the intent of the drafters, regardless of its compliance with natural law.
                        Cover adds that "by the late eighteenth century, natural law had been rejected as
                        lacking relevance and meaning, as a basis of social policy through law." <hi rend="i">Ibid.</hi>, 37-40, 50-55, 25.</item>

                        those rights." Constitutions were an attempt to restrict the legislature's ability to
                        infringe upon natural rights. Jack N. Rakove, Original Meanings: Politics and Ideas in the

            <p>Jefferson recognized the same principle in asserting that social duties corresponding to the
                    preservation of rights arose naturally in civil society.<hi rend="sup">24</hi> In his commonplace
                    book he transcribed the following quotation from Lord Kames: "The perfection of human
                    society consists in that just degree of union among individuals, which to each reserves freedom and
                    independency, as far as is consistent with place and order."<hi rend="sup">25</hi>
                    Jefferson believed that social duties included the subordination of one's own political will to the
                    will of the majority and the acceptance of the rule of law governing one's actions. "Every
                    man, and every body of men on earth, possesses the right of self government," Jefferson
                    wrote in 1790 in a "Cabinet Opinion." "They receive it with their being
                    from the hand of nature. Individuals exercise it by their single will—collections of men
                    by that of their majority; for the law of the majority is the natural law of every society of
                        men."<hi rend="sup">26</hi> He expressed the same idea in his correspondence to <placeName>

                    </placeName>. "I consider the source of authority with us to be the nation. Their will,
                    declared through its proper organ, is valid till revoked by their will declared through its proper
                    organ again also."<hi rend="sup">27</hi> To Jefferson, law was both an expression of the
                    majority's will and a limitation on the exercise of personal liberties to be accepted by all members
                    of the society, even those dissenting. "The first principle of republicanism," he
                    wrote, "is that the <hi rend="i">lex majoris partis</hi> is the fundamental law of every
                    society of individuals of equal rights; to consider the will of the society enounced [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] by the majority of a single vote as sacred as if unanimous is the first of all
                    lessons in importance, yet the last which is thoroughly learnt."<hi rend="sup">28</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ideally, man's moral sense would express itself in majority rule to conform society's laws to natural
                    law. Yet Jefferson realized that the creation of a civil society held no short-term guarantee of the
                    fulfillment of this ideal. Rather than causing him to abandon his reliance on law, this realization
                    only reinforced the need for law to exercise a restraining influence.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>

            <p>Jefferson's fear of state power tempered his conviction that members of a civil society granted some
                    of their natural liberties to the state in order to secure protection for the rest.<hi rend="sup">30</hi> Governments were to do no more than use their limited powers to allow the exercise of
                    liberty in a social environment. The aggrandizement of the state, either by exercising more power
                    than was necessary for this task or by interference in matters not properly contained within its
                    legitimate scope of authority, Jefferson deemed tyranny. The exercise of liberty within a social
                    setting could be restrained by government or by each person in the society recognizing the rights of
                        others.<hi rend="sup">31</hi> Jefferson approvingly quoted Vattel to the effect that justice is
                    the equivalent of an "obligation to respect the rights of others."<hi rend="sup">32</hi> Man-made law existed to ensure a just society by sanctioning men or governments who
                    failed to recognize this obligation to respect others' rights. Jefferson noted that "every
                    power is dangerous which is not bound up by general rules."<hi rend="sup">33</hi> The
                    threat to rights from government was greater than that from individuals and was addressed by
                    constitutions and declarations of rights restricting governmental authority.</p>
            <p>In a bill of rights the government both recognized individual liberties and pledged not to abridge
                    those liberties. One writer has described this as a "Lockean conception of liberty as a
                    'natural right' to be protected against government."<hi rend="sup">34</hi> Jefferson made
                    the same point in the following terms: "that a bill of rights is what the people are
                    entitled to against every government on earth, general or particular; and what no just government
                    should refuse or rest on inference."<hi rend="sup">35</hi>
            </p>
            <p>John Locke wrote that government "has no other end but the preservation of
                        property."<hi rend="sup">36</hi> His position was definitive for many Enlightenment
                    theoreticians and was shared by most colonial leaders.<hi rend="sup">37</hi> Jefferson, <list type="footnotes">

                    </placeName> in his drafting of the Declaration of the Rights of Man. Nonetheless, Jefferson
                    believed the right to property essential to the pursuit of happiness and a legitimate focus of
                    governmental action.<hi rend="sup">39</hi> Laws for the protection of private property were
                    essential to the maintenance of the civil society.</p>
            <p>Jefferson contended that laws governing property and society in general should reflect the natural
                    law and serve the social good. "A right to property," he wrote, "is
                    founded in our natural wants in the means with which we are endowed to satisfy these wants, and that
                    right to what we acquire by those means without violating the similar rights of sensible
                    beings."40 He also wrote of "a right given by nature to all men, individual or
                    associated: that of rescuing their own property wrongfully taken."<hi rend="sup">41</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Property rights were established by labor or creative energy. Both were products of man's natural
                    wants that produced social good. Land rightfully belonged only to men who would occupy and use it.
                    Likewise, an inventor could benefit from the product of his ideas, but the ideas belonged to
                    society, not to the individual.<hi rend="sup">42</hi> Accordingly, the profits due a person from his
                    efforts in working land or inventing a new product should not be taken arbitrarily. The laws of
                    property should protect a man's economic interest in these pursuits. But inheritance on the basis of
                    birth was something else. No labor or invention created a property right in inherited property.
                    Jefferson saw inheritance laws that transferred the benefit of property to people who expended no
                    effort in creating its value as inconsistent with natural <list type="footnotes">

            </p>
            <p>Jefferson conceived another function of government to be the protection of equality. "Of
                    liberty," he wrote in 1819, "then I would say that, in the whole plenitude of its
                    extent, it is unobstructed action according to our will, but rightful liberty is unobstructed action
                    according to our will within limits drawn around us by the equal right of others."<hi rend="sup">44</hi> For Jefferson "equal rights" existed not as a positive
                    right to be secured by government, but as a legal recognition of the limits of liberty. Government
                    authority preserved one citizen's rights from interference by others. Yet the government's ability
                    to exercise this authority was tempered by the greater risk posed to human rights from government
                    than from other men.<hi rend="sup">45</hi> Jefferson never envisioned a government acting positively
                    to create or assert the rights of one citizen relative to another, especially not in the name of
                    "equality": "To take from one, because it is thought his own industry and
                    that of his father had acquired too much in order to spare to others who or whose fathers have not
                    exercised equal industry or skill is to violate arbitrarily the free principle of association, the
                    guarantee to everyone a free exercise of his industry and the fruits acquired by it."<hi rend="sup">46</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Jefferson believed that government should be limited both in size and scope and that government power
                    should be centered in those institutions closest to the people. David Mayer has recently written
                    that Jefferson's Whig constitutionalism was rooted in "a profound distrust of concentrated
                    political power and, with it, an especially intense devotion to the ideal of limited
                        government."<hi rend="sup">47</hi> In his <hi rend="i">Notes</hi> Jefferson wrote that
                    the "legitimate powers of government extend to such acts only as are injurious to
                        others."<hi rend="sup">48</hi> At his 1801 inauguration he described his institutional
                    ideal as "a wise and frugal government, which shall restrain men from injuring one another,
                    which shall leave them free to regulate their pursuits of industry and improvement, and shall not
                    take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned. This is the sum of good government."
                    Ellis, relying on this and similar pronouncements, has concluded that Jefferson "remained
                    true to the Whig tradition, which regarded any explicit exercise of authority that was not
                    consensual or voluntary as inherently invasive."<hi rend="sup">49</hi> Thus to ensure that
                    the government did not exceed its authority, Jefferson believed that local and state governments
                    should be <list type="footnotes">

                    Constitution and the elective power of the people together checked governmental authority. As
                    president, he had surplus revenues in the treasury and recognized a public need for internal
                    improvements that could not feasibly be pursued on anything but a national scale. Yet he still would
                    not act without a constitutional amendment authorizing the government to undertake the construction
                    of "new and indissoluble ties" through expenditures in support of

                            than to a reactionary position of political opposition and perceived Federalist abuses of

                    elected officials from addressing necessary social goals until the people allocated to them
                    sufficient authority. A similar adherence to constitutional principle is evident in Jefferson's

            <p>American republicanism rested on civic humanism that envisioned rational and virtuous men exercising
                    their natural rights of political self-governance with full respect for the equal rights of fellow
                    citizens to pursue their own political, economic, and personal goals. Gordon Wood writes that this
                    ideal of "republicanism meant more for Americans than simply the elimination of a king and
                    the institution of an elective system. It added a moral dimension, a utopian depth, to the political
                    separation from <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>—a depth that involved the very character of the society."<hi rend="sup">56</hi> In the years after the Revolution, the civic humanism contained in American
                    republicanism would be challenged by, and integrated with, a liberal doctrine of unfettered
                    individual freedoms and capitalistic pursuits.<hi rend="sup">57</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While political leaders fought their constitutional and public law battles over how much the new
                    nation was going to reflect "republican virtue" or "democratic
                    self-interest," the decision was largely being made in the private law forum. The
                    importance of private law courts derived in part from the legal confusion following the Revolution.
                    Morton Horowitz finds that postrevolutionary America had to reconstruct the legitimacy of law on a
                    consensual foundation. This required either legislative enactment, reliance on custom, or, as James
                    Wilson maintained, acceptance of common law judges as agents of a sovereign people. The judges
                    themselves chose the third option in the absence of any other authority. Judges came to see their
                    function as having expanded beyond merely applying existing law to reshaping and modifying law to
                    meet the needs and wants of a growing society. Judges believed that they could be more responsive
                    than the legislatures—they had to be for their dockets would not wait for legislative
                    direction. Implicitly, they argued, judicial authority remained checked, for if the legislature
                    disagreed with a developing common law doctrine, it could always reverse it. Meanwhile, the growth
                    of judicial authority created an expanded role for common law judges to play in directing the
                    nation's course into the nineteenth century.<hi rend="sup">58</hi>

            <p>The judicial assumption of greater power did not meet with universal approbation. Republican theory
                    provided that under a constitutional framework judges were to follow the letter of the law as
                    expressed by the populace through its legislature. Jefferson wrote in 1785 that by applying their
                    own sense of right and reason judges had sought to render the law more certain, but instead they
                    made it more uncertain.<hi rend="sup">59</hi> Partly in response to these attacks, a self-conscious
                    judiciary moved to ensure greater legitimacy by insisting on published reports of common law
                    precedents, relying on stricter enforcement of legal rules of procedure and thereby sharpening
                    pleadings and limiting the role of juries, elevating the stature of a professional bar, and relying
                    on established common law principles to instruct juries or set aside jury verdicts.<hi rend="sup">60</hi> Justice Joseph Story, himself a key proponent of judicial positivism, notes that judges
                    were restrained in shaping the law by immutable principles of reason, morality, and order, as well
                    as by the need to follow precedent.<hi rend="sup">61</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Recent scholarship in the American legal history of the early republic has opposed the earlier
                    teachings of the instrumentalist school that law served merely as a tool to organize society to
                    reflect prevailing social values. Newer work in this area has shown law's role to be much more
                    complex than initially postulated. Law does not merely reflect social values, economic interests, or
                    political structure. It is not subject to change at the whim of a business, political, or legal
                    elite. The multiplicity of legal actors and their varied motivations reject this reductionist
                        idea.<hi rend="sup">62</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Law, to maintain its legitimacy, must rely on certain eternal truths as well as its own internal
                    integrity, referred to as precedent, procedure, or constitutionality. It also must either embody
                    prevailing social values and beliefs or risk divorcing itself from the public and prompting anarchy
                    or revolution. In America it has fulfilled both these needs by assuming a relatively autonomous and
                    hegemonic function, reminding society of its traditional values and beliefs even as it has
                    reoriented them in changing legal decisions. Many authors have noted that the pace of legal change

                            conclusions have been offered by other historians. Tomlins finds that judges in the early
                            republic perceived law as "the great rock of cultural stability and ideological
                            certainty." He asserts that during this period law was determined by recourse to
                            legal discourse's own rules of formation rather than by obedience to extralegal societal
                            forces or considerations. "Law's relationship to the economy, as to any social
                            process, is hence mediated by the particularities and anomalies of its own process of
                            creation." Tomlins,<hi rend="i">Law, Labor, and Ideology</hi>, 284, 294. Similarly,

                    procedural dictates of pleading recognizable legal arguments mitigate any social tendencies toward
                    rapid transformation. Typical of many of the founding fathers, Jefferson respected law precisely for
                    its institutional inertia.</p>
            <p>To Jefferson the Constitution guaranteed that the people's will should be expressed in the laws. He
                    was unwilling to give the court any authority that might impinge on the rights of the electorate.
                    Herbert Sloan argues that Jefferson's advocacy of generational revision of the Constitution must not
                    be misunderstood as endorsing the idea of a living constitution. Jefferson was a strict
                    constructionist. To him the only proper interpretation of law was the original intent of the
                    drafters. To rewrite the Constitution because it no longer fit social needs was quite different than
                    to misread the old document to serve political purposes.<hi rend="sup">64</hi> Likewise, statutory
                    law was to be modified only in accordance with the opinions of a changing electorate. Judges and
                    legislators alike were compelled to accept the laws as written. Jefferson expressed the supremacy of
                    law as the basis of a judge's authority when he wrote, "Relieve the judges from the rigor
                    of text law, and permit them, with praetorian discretion, to wander into equity and the whole legal
                    system becomes uncertain."<hi rend="sup">65</hi> Elsewhere, he advocated "strict
                    and inflexible" rulings by judges acting as "mere machines."<hi rend="sup">66</hi> John Dos Passos notes that Jefferson wanted law to create a system of
                    authority. This differed from the practice of much of the world where authority laid down the
                        law.<hi rend="sup">67</hi> Christopher Tomlins summarizes what could be Jefferson's own thoughts
                    on legal authority: "Law, not politics, furnished the discourse of rule in this American
                    model…. America was to be a polity of laws and not men, a polity of the rule of
                        law."<hi rend="sup">68</hi> Law embodied the best in man—his reason,
                    rationality, and ability to conceive a social ideal. It could not be subordinated to the passions of
                    a few reformers.</p>
            <p>In the early republic law came to encompass republican ideals. Constitutions delineated the
                    authorities of various governmental bodies and restricted the scope of their actions relative to
                    citizens' rights. Public and private law expressed the Jeffersonian precepts of the primacy of civil
                    law, a preference for limited government exercised in institutional bodies closest to the people,

                    conformity precluded radical social change. As an expression of Jeffersonian ideas as well as the
                    authority within the civil society, it would shape whatever alternatives the man or the country
                    could pursue regarding slavery.</p>
            <p>Whether Jefferson was restrained by his own political and legal ideology in his approach to slavery
                    would be largely irrelevant if he had not desired its abolition. The historiography that has been
                    critical of Jefferson's inaction on slavery has frequently assumed that Jefferson condoned the
                        institution.<hi rend="sup">69</hi> His writings and public actions, however, expressed a
                    different attitude.<hi rend="sup">70</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Jefferson believed slavery to be a social evil because it denied men their natural liberties. In
                    addition, it corrupted the slaveholders and their society. Lastly, it created the possibility of
                    armed conflict within society through a slave revolt. Jefferson explained the basis of his fears of
                    revolt in his belief that "all men would and should rise up against so antirepublican a
                    horror as slavery."<hi rend="sup">71</hi> The "Saint Domingue" revolt was
                    an example of this fear becoming reality. Jefferson's statements of his own attitude about slavery
                    included condemnations of the institution for each of the above reasons, combined with elements of
                    self-excoriation and rationalization.<hi rend="sup">72</hi> Yet these statements are included in the
                        <hi rend="i">Notes</hi> in which Jefferson also emphasized perceived differences between the
                    races, appearing to some even to justify slavery.</p>
            <p>In Query XIV of the <hi rend="i">Notes</hi>, Jefferson identified only one
                    "difference… fixed in nature" between the races—that of
                    color. And while he derived from that difference some aesthetic conclusions, he did not find color
                    to render blacks any less entitled to recognition of their natural rights than whites. Jefferson
                    wrote of a "suspicion… hazarded with great diffidence" that blacks were
                    "inferior to whites in the endowments of both mind and body," while seeming
                    willing, even anxious, to have his suspicion proved wrong. In any case political equality was never
                    dependent upon equal faculties but rather on a natural liberty. Jefferson never doubted the humanity
                    of slaves. "Nothing is more certainly written in the book of fate than that these <list type="footnotes">

                            Revolution" and felt embarrassment before both French friends and even God for his

                    political actions regarding slavery and the law.</p>
            <p>Jefferson believed black slaves to be human and thus entitled to the legal protection of their
                    natural rights. This belief, in part, led him to take the actions opposing slavery that he did. Yet
                    the extent to which Jefferson was willing to take public action in support of abolition was
                    restrained by other ideological beliefs as strong and important to Jefferson as his belief in the
                    humanity of the slaves. Jefferson's awareness of these competing tensions was manifested in his
                    public actions. These actions, when examined in light of his political philosophy, show him to have
                    acted purposefully in a manner consistent with his beliefs.</p>

                            a fact of their lives. Jefferson was surrounded by slavery. He owned slaves, his friends
                            owned slaves, and the law recognized slaves. Despite personal anguish over the institution,
                            Jefferson continued it. When he wrote the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson had almost
                            two hundred slaves; fifty years later he had over two hundred. Morgan, <hi rend="i">American

                        by many of his closest friends. Of George Wythe, Jefferson wrote, his "sentiments on

                    manumission of slaves. He subsequently referred to the experience in his autobiography and in a

            <p>The next public statement Jefferson made on slavery came in his drafts of grievances against Britain
                    prior to the Revolution. Perhaps the best insights into Jefferson's understanding of law as
                    establishing a "form" of social governance are presented in these writings.
                    Jefferson's commitment to including comments on slavery in his draft of the Declaration of
                    Independence is evident in his earlier use of a slavery clause in a submission to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> Convention that was later published in <hi rend="i">A Summary View of the Rights of
                        British America</hi> (1774). There Jefferson accused the king of perverting the government
                    "by prompting our negroes to rise in arms among us, those very negroes whom, by an inhuman
                    use of his negative, he hath refused us permission to exclude by law." In the Declaration
                    Jefferson separated these two arguments. In his draft he wrote, "He has incited…
                    insurrections among slaves… [encouraging them to] rise in arms." His point in
                    this grievance was that the king was using slaves, like Indians and loyalists, to fight for Britain,
                    a reference to Governor Dunmore's call in 1775 for slaves to attack their masters. Congress
                    condensed the assertion: "[he has] excited domestic insurrection amongst us." The
                    other argument, from <hi rend="i">A Summary View</hi>, Jefferson spelled out in greater detail:</p>
            <quote rend="blockquote">

                        of the Christian king of Great Britain. Determined to keep open a market where men should be
                        bought and sold, he has prostituted his negative for oppressing every legislative attempt to

                    congressional position succinctly, "How can Congress criticize the King for freeing the
                    slaves to fight against their owners and also for imposing slavery, a cruel and inhumane
                    institution, upon the colonies?"<hi rend="sup">79</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet Jefferson did not see the inconsistency. He believed that the colonial exercise of the public
                    will through elected officials to limit the growth of an abhorrent institution was legitimate, while
                    encouraging slaves to revolt against the American populace, as the king did in total disregard for
                    property rights and law, was not a legitimate governmental action. To most of the world the revised
                    document is more consistent and supportable. But for Jefferson the point concerning the legitimate
                    exercise of governmental power was lost in the revision. He expressed an antipathy toward slavery by
                    referring favorably to bills designed to limit the importation of slaves.<hi rend="sup">80</hi> Yet
                    the draft also expressed his anger at the king's efforts to free the slaves. The inconsistency
                    disappears if one's focus is not the slaves but the use of governmental authority consistent with
                    constitutional law. Both actions by the king were illegal according to Jefferson. If Jefferson's
                    statements concerning slavery in the Declaration are read in reference to the colonial petitions
                    against British policy in the years before the Revolution, his antipathy toward slavery and his
                    insistence that it be addressed within the limits of law become clear.</p>
            <p>The Declaration offers an excellent example of Jefferson's reasoning regarding the use of
                    governmental authority and law in dealing with social concerns. John Phillip Reid argues that
                    American grievances were written as appeals to King George to reassert the traditional 1688
                    constitution of <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> in which the colonists perceived the king's prerogative as a check on parliamentary
                    tyranny. Jefferson's language in the Declaration evinced the same argument. In this way, the
                    Revolution is understandable as a legalistic reaction to changes in the English constitution that
                    resulted in increased parliamentary rule over the colonies. Parliament had not only undermined the
                    authority of colonial legislatures by 1765 but the authority of the king as well.<hi rend="sup">81</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some might argue that if Jefferson could advocate revolution, seemingly in disregard of the

                            subsequent bill he proposed in 1778, which passed. Its stated purpose was to stop
                            "the increase of the evil by importation, leaving to future efforts its final
                            eradication." Jefferson's sincerity may be judged by the repeated expression of
                            this same desire to take steps to eliminate slavery, ultimately to be accomplished only when
                            the public willed it. Jefferson, "Autobiography," in <hi rend="i">Selections</hi>, Padover, 1141.</item>

                    law and constitutionalism from acting to secure the same rights for black Americans? The answer is
                    that in justifying the Revolution Jefferson was appealing to, not arguing against, the established
                    constitutional order. He believed that <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> had violated its own constitution and was dependent upon America to save it. The same
                    argument would not support political action to free black Americans held in slavery. In that case,
                    America's own elected representatives created positive laws of slavery. As Judge Mansfield
                    implicitly said in the <hi rend="i">

                    </placeName> in 1772, positive law could occasionally create a situation contrary to reason and
                    nature. When this occurred, as it did in the instance of slavery, Jefferson had confidence enough to
                    rely on the ultimate reason of the American people to bring about change through the political-legal
                    system. He could encourage that change first in the minds of his fellow citizens and then through
                    proposals to revise its laws; but he could not dictate it.</p>
            <p>During the Revolution, Jefferson served on a committee to revise the laws of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, whose lofty purpose he described as follows: "that our whole code must be
                    reviewed, adapted to our republican form of government, and now that we had no negative of councils,
                    governors, kings to restrain us from doing right, that it should be corrected in all its parts with
                    a single eye to reason, and the good of those for whose government it was formed."<hi rend="sup">82</hi> But doing what was right and reasonable for the good of the governed did not
                    include freeing the slaves. For Jefferson complete abolition was not then, or evidently at any other
                    time, even a possibility. Abolition would either have taken from current property holders that which
                    they had earned by their own efforts or forced the government to amass huge sums of money for
                    purchasing slaves and making some provision for them. The committee did, however, make a more modest
                    proposal, one consistent with Jefferson's ideas on property and the limits of government power.</p>
            <p>The first and only meeting of the committee in January, 1777, dealt with the conceptual framework of
                    a revision. Edmund Pendle-ton proposed using William Blackstone's model, to which Jefferson
                    objected. In his 1765 edition of the <hi rend="i">Commentaries on the Laws of <placeName>
                            <country reg="enk">England</country>
                        </placeName>
               </hi>, Blackstone asserted natural persons "are such as the God of nature
                    formed us." Blackstone deduced that slavery was invalid except as regards prisoners of war
                    and then only for the duration of the war.<hi rend="sup">83</hi> Chattel slavery, recognizing

                    </placeName>. In his 1773 edition Blackstone modified his text to recognize slavery resting on

                    adopting Blackstone's expression of English law would mean the abolition of slavery. "They
                    [then] must have restored slavery after having abolished it," Adams wrote, "they
                    must have assumed to themselves all the odium of establishing it as a positive institution, directly
                    in face of all the principles they had proclaimed."<hi rend="sup">85</hi> Jefferson
                    remembered that Blackstone's model was rejected because it would have eliminated the body of common
                    law that had been developed in America. The new code would then be subject to interpretation by the
                    courts, with the inevitable problem of property rights being, in Jefferson's words, up "in
                    the air" until decisions could be issued.<hi rend="sup">86</hi> Certainly the peculiar
                    American property right of slavery would have been one of those up "in the air."</p>
            <p>Jefferson and Wythe instead suggested a gradual abolition, emancipating slaves born some time after
                    the passage of the new code, educating them, and transporting them to a new land.<hi rend="sup">87</hi> This plan preserved current property interests, posed only a minimal disruption to society,
                    expanded governmental powers only slightly, and rid America of slavery and the risk of racial
                    violence and miscegenation. Moreover, because inherited property could more lawfully be alienated by
                    government action than earned property, postponement bought legitimacy. Jefferson's reasoning in
                    this proposal is best seen in his more detailed explanation of a similar plan put forward in 1824.
                    He proposed establishing a colony of freed slaves in Africa: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                nothing can be suffered to support it, but positive law." Judge Mansfield ruled
                                that positive law, such as the laws on slavery in the colonies, could create a situation
                                contrary to reason and nature. Once created, this law and the social situations it
                                engendered, would have to be enforced. To a lawyer in the late eighteenth century, the

                            <p>It should also be noted that Jefferson's aversion to Blackstone may have been rooted in
                                concerns other than slavery. Jefferson and other colonial lawyers and political
                                theorists found greater empathy with the writings of Coke expressing ideas more
                                compatible with the colonists' understandings of constitutional law. An excellent

                    suggested instead emancipating children, since the "estimated value of the new born infant
                    is so low (say twelve dollars and fifty cents), that it would probably be yielded by the
                        owner."<hi rend="sup">89</hi> Yet even this proposal was rejected. "It was
                    thought that this should be kept back," he reflected in his autobiography, "and

                    the document declared, "or the continuance of slavery beyond the generation which shall be

                    the government. Jefferson was assigned to a committee to draft an ordinance outlining the course of
                    expansion into these lands. The committee recommended that the territory be closed to slavery after
                    1800. It was the first proposal of federal government action regarding slavery.<hi rend="sup">93</hi> This provision failed by one vote.<hi rend="sup">94</hi> The defeat prompted Jefferson to
                    write that the "fate of millions unborn [was] hanging on the tongue of one man, and heaven
                    was silent in that awful moment."<hi rend="sup">95</hi> He could support this provision
                    because it deprived no one of property and did not expand federal powers. At that point there was no
                    law permitting slavery in the Northwest Territory, so in its absence, natural law applied. In this
                    instance, Jefferson could give free expression to his antislavery sentiments.</p>
            <p>This was not the case when, in 1815, Congress attempted to dictate policy to territories attempting
                    to become states. Jefferson feared recent Supreme Court decisions expanding federal power relative

            <p>The Constitution provided that Congress could not act for twenty years, or until 1807, to abolish the
                    slave trade. William Wiecek observes that Jefferson as president at the time "called for
                    action at the earliest possible moment." Even then, the proposed ban of the slave trade
                    resulted in "heated… almost riotous debate" in the House.<hi rend="sup">96</hi> In Jefferson's annual message to Congress on December 2, 1806, he said,</p>

            <p>In retrospect, the abolition of the slave trade, secured in legislation, signed into law in 1807, and
                    effective January 1, 1808, may appear inconsequential. Slavery continued unabated in the South, and
                    the primary effect of the legislation was the increase in the value of slaves already in America.
                    Yet, William Freehling thinks disparaging the ban on the slave trade is a mistake. "This
                    accomplishment," he writes, "too often dismissed as a non-accomplishment, shows
                    more clearly than anything else the impact on anti-slavery of the Revolutionary generation.
                    Furthermore, nowhere else does one see so clearly that Thomas Jefferson helped cripple the Southern

            <p>Jefferson believed that reform must be premised on public opinion. Only the will of the people could
                    legitimately change social policy. Therefore, prohibitions of slavery must come as a result of
                    public sentiment. "You know that nobody wishes more ardently to see an abolition not only
                    of the trade but of the condition of slavery," he wrote in 1788. "But…
                    I am here as a public servant; and those whom I serve having not yet been able to give their voice
                    against this practice, it is decent for me to avoid too public a demonstration of my wishes to see
                    it abandoned.<hi rend="sup">99</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He believed that the change would occur soon. In a letter in 1785 he wrote that the abolitionist
                    feeling was growing stronger in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> because the young men there "under preparation for public life" had
                    "sucked in the principles of liberty as if it were their mother's milk" from the
                    teachings of Wythe.<hi rend="sup">100</hi> The key to abolition for Jefferson was education and
                    experience. Confident in the innate ability of man to perceive moral correctness and right reason,
                    it was only a matter of time before the public would realize the untenability of slavery.</p>
            <p>But, at the same time, Jefferson was concerned "that premature endorsement by a figure of
                    his prominence might easily damage the antislavery cause."<hi rend="sup">101</hi> In 1785
                    he told his friends that they could not count on his active participation in the abolition movement
                    and later denied support to Edward Coles, who planned to release his slaves and establish them as
                    free farmers.<hi rend="sup">102</hi> Coles sought Jefferson's public voice and the voluntary
                    manumission of his slaves, but Jefferson felt compelled to wait for public opinion to take its
                    course.</p>
            <p>Many have criticized Jefferson for his failure to help Coles, deducing from this refusal only a tepid
                    commitment, at best, to the antislavery cause or finding it an example of inconsistency between
                    ideological expression and public action. Jefferson was not alone in refusing support, however.
                    Coles approached Jefferson and <placeName>

                    support of abolition could delay the ultimate success of the movement. Isolated instances of
                    emancipation may well have led southerners to intensify their defense of the institution. Coles had,
                    in the words of McCoy, "a principled and passionate hatred of slavery." Yet he not
                    only forgave Jefferson and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>

                    political postures. He wrote that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s principles were "sound, pure, conscientious." Coles described
                    Jefferson's position as "in perfect accordance with his character, in fine harmony with his
                    philanthropic republicanism, and in every way worthy of the renown[ed] <list type="footnotes">

                    surprising. Jefferson consistently opposed federal government involvement in any realm outside of
                    interstate and foreign relations. He could support federal laws to ban the international slave trade
                    and restrict slavery in federal territories, but he would not sanction any federal action compelling
                    abolition or emancipation in the states. In this opinion, he was far from alone. Donald Fehrenbacher
                    contends that after 1787 the Constitution recognized slavery as almost entirely in the jurisdiction
                    of the states, much like the subjects of other legal codes concerning personal property
                    relationships—marriage, inheritance, and contract.<hi rend="sup">105</hi> James <placeName>

                    cited the decision as evidence that slavery could not exist but for positive law creating it. Yet

                    the enlightened reason that Jefferson hoped to see in his Virginians. Where the majority will so
                    desired, state action could be taken to abolish slavery. Even in the North, however, abolition was
                    accompanied by a respect for the property rights of the slaveholders. States either compensated
                    slaveholders for their losses or after 1776 imposed gradual abolition.<hi rend="sup">109</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the South, reaching the same accommodation was more difficult. Political ideology may have defined
                    the issue, but regional variations in culture and economics produced different results. Jefferson
                    could not obtain majority support for abolition in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> because, by 1780, slavery was too well enmeshed into southern society. Timothy Breen
                    points out that the "charter" colonists exercised great influence in shaping
                    colonial culture for subsequent generations. Early in the seventeenth century the North and South
                    established different social arrangements that later generations accepted. Of Virginians, Breen
                    writes, "They were not free to abolish slavery or staple crop agriculture: these had become
                    expressions of a regional way of life."<hi rend="sup">110</hi> Abolition in the North did
                    not involve depriving families of their fortunes or raising huge sums of money through taxation to
                    compensate them for their losses. Jeffersonian ideology, respecting property rights, state
                    sovereignty, majority rule, the primacy of law, and limited government, provided the terms on which
                    abolition would have to occur. Southern society could not easily meet those terms. Recognizing the
                    role of political ideology also helps to explain the temporary northern acceptance of the retention
                    of the institution in the South to a degree that economic, social, and psychological explanations
                    cannot. The North and South in the early republic shared a basic political ideology and legal
                    structure, if not a common psychological, social, or economic basis.</p>
            <p>Because he tended to confound political principle with virtue, Jefferson found compromise difficult.
                    He saw all human behavior as a reflection of character. His condemnation of much of contemporary <placeName>

                    comments betray a disgust with the inability of his peers to live up to his ideals. The Newtonian
                    world view was, after all, premised on absolutes in the form of natural laws, Absolutes resist

                    "wrong." St. George Tucker said of Jefferson that "he was occasionally
                    somewhat dictatorial and impatient of contradiction."<hi rend="sup">111</hi> Gordon Wood
                    writes, "not only did Jefferson not have an original or skeptical mind, he could in fact be
                    downright doctrinaire, an early version of a knee-jerk liberal." Wood accepts Bernard
                    Bailyn's assertion that Jefferson was an eighteenth-century Enlightenment stereotype, accepting
                    liberal attitudes and ideas totally and uncritically. "Jefferson was inspired by a vision
                    of how things could and should be," continues Wood. "He was the pure American
                    innocent. He had little understanding of man's capacity for evil and had no tragic sense
                        whatsoever."<hi rend="sup">112</hi> One need not go so far as Wood in characterizing
                    Jefferson in order to recognize him as a man so deeply committed to ideals and principles that even
                    the most desired expedients for social good would be rejected if they contradicted, and therefore
                    threatened, the greater good. Leonard Levy describes Jefferson as having "little room for
                    compromise… and no room for self doubt." He had the "passion of a true
                    believer" and "behaved as if a prisoner of his own ideas."<hi rend="sup">113</hi> Ellis notes Jefferson's "instinctive tendency to think in terms of moralistic
                    dichotomies," his "affinity for idealized or idyllic vision," and his
                    "all or nothing mentality." Ellis writes, "Rather than adjust his
                    expectations in the face of disappointment, he tended to bury them deeper inside himself and regard
                    the disjunction between his ideals and worldly imperfections as the world's problem rather than his
                    own." For Jefferson, Ellis concludes, "there was one truth, not many."<hi rend="sup">114</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Jefferson's truth did include recognition of the natural right to freedom. His political ideology,
                    however, required positive law to give effect to natural rights in a civil society. It was precisely
                    Jefferson's hopeful "innocence," as Wood puts it, that led him to believe that the
                    majority of people in his beloved <placeName>

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> would eventually embrace abolition. But, until then, respect for the laws, embodying
                    the ideas of constitutionalism and republican government, had to be preeminent. Appleby notes that
                    Jefferson felt compelled to reconcile his "radical understanding of personal freedom with
                    pervasive assumptions about order and justice."<hi rend="sup">115</hi> Only in this context
                    does Wood's comment make sense: "He knew slavery was a great evil, but he believed his
                    generation could do little about it."<hi rend="sup">116</hi>

            <p>Jan Lewis and Merrill Peterson concur that Jefferson measured "worth in ideas and
                    institutions, not human relationship"<hi rend="sup">117</hi> Take, for example, his calm
                    detachment at the news of deaths in Shays' Rebellion. "I like a little rebellion now and
                    then," he wrote. "It is like a storm in the atmosphere. It was too bad that some
                    people were killed, but the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of
                    patriots and tyrants. It is its natural manure."<hi rend="sup">118</hi> And of the French
                    Revolution, Jefferson observed, "Rather than it should have failed, I would have seen half
                    the earth desolated."<hi rend="sup">119</hi> Family tradition had it that when Shadwell,
                    Jefferson's childhood home, burned in 1770, his first concern was for his books and papers.<hi rend="sup">120</hi> And in a letter to his beloved daughter Polly he seemed to justify his love
                    of her on her continued fulfillment of his ideals for womanhood.<hi rend="sup">121</hi> jefferson
                    was just as hard on himself, insisting that correspondence be answered and guests received, in
                    fulfillment of the expected role, even when he suffered pain and ill health in the months before his
                        death.<hi rend="sup">122</hi> To this man even the cruelties of slavery could be extended one
                    additional generation in order that the problem should be dispensed of in "the right
                    way"—through law and within a constitutional scheme that respected property
                    rights, majority will, and limited government.</p>
            <p>Jefferson's almost compulsive concern for order and rationality were not solely a function of his
                    personality, for each was a tenet of the Newtonian system. The acceptance of absolute truths derived
                    from order and rationality influenced popular thought on natural science, music, architecture, and
                    politics. Jefferson simply adhered to these precepts with more dedication or
                    "principle" than most. Ellis emphasizes Jefferson's attachment to ideals that
                    compelled him to adopt deductive reasoning by which certain inviolable moral truths predetermined
                    the resolution of specific issues.<hi rend="sup">123</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Jefferson's practice of law also reinforced his natural proclivity for order and rationality. As

                    heavily on the written law. The practice of law in America has long been a contest between lawyers
                    whose approach to cases is determined by the law and those who emphasize the facts. Do the facts
                    speak for themselves in calling for relief? Or rather, is the law the final arbiter in dispensing
                    justice regardless of the emotional response engendered by the facts? Accounts of Jefferson's law
                    practice indicate his emphasis on law as controlling the outcome of cases. He took the law as
                    doctrine and reasoned logically from general to specific instances in making legal arguments. Edmund <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Randolph</settlement>
                    </placeName> contrasted Jefferson's style with Patrick Henry's when he commented that, "Mr.
                    Jefferson drew copiously from the depths of the law, Mr. Henry from the recesses of the human
                        heart."<hi rend="sup">125</hi> Men such as Jefferson, who envisioned a future society
                    of greater justice, yet were committed to the rule of law as the only means of its attainment, could
                    be frustrated by the restraining effect of law. Changes in law depended upon changes in popular
                    sentiment, and accordingly law was sometimes slow to embrace other ideals.</p>
            <p>Perhaps no endeavor in Jefferson's life is more indicative of his desire to do things "the
                    right way" than his fifty-four-year commitment to building <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Monticello</settlement>
                    </placeName>. During this time, Jefferson was always refining and reconstructing. Still, his passion
                    was not the process but the ideal end product. Rhys Isaac argues that historians reconstruct the
                    past by careful study of how people lived. He sees Jefferson the builder of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Monticello</settlement>
                    </placeName> as "a quantifying, rationalizing taskmaster."<hi rend="sup">126</hi>
                    Likewise for Jack McLaughlin humanity replicates itself in its architecture. By looking at the
                    building process one can see the man revealed in "a deep and unaccommodated way."
                    Jefferson, according to McLaughlin, left a detailed portrait of himself in <placeName>

                    "Wythe… reinforced Jefferson's belief that the models for a pure architecture
                    had been cast in concrete by the Romans," McLaughlin notes, "and formulated
                    mathematically—with the finality of a papal bull—by the sixteenth-century
                    master, Andrea Palladio."<hi rend="sup">128</hi> Jefferson's home was to be more than a
                    residence; it was also to be a model for his society and a reflection of the absolute values by
                    which he lived his life. McLaughlin's study of Jefferson as builder lays out the values and thought

                        <p>These early drawings and the voluminous <hi rend="i">Notes</hi> that accompany them reveal
                            much about the Jefferson personality. They are of a kind with his other known character
                            traits: self-discipline, his insistence on personal privacy, his need to save and account
                            for everything—money, books, records, facts. Even his choice of the law as a
                            profession was a measure of his desire for an ordered social and political universe made
                            permanent by rationally ordained statutes. He became a revolutionary in part because of what
                            he perceived to be the crown's breach of the integrity of the English legal system. This was
                            not simply a political or ethical decision on his part; in taxing the colonies without
                            representation, Parliament denied the validity of his very personality, of everything that
                            he was. His architectural drawings are symbolic of his kind of compulsive personality. Lines
                            are executed mechanically with rule and compass, to precise scale. Measurements are carried
                            out to four or five decimal places, an absurdity in the building trades where carpenters and
                            bricklayers are often lucky if they can keep to the inch rather than the ten-thousandth of
                            an inch. For Jefferson, those measurements were not simply practical means to an end,
                            instructions to an artisan; they were mathematical absolutes that recorded universal
                                verities.<hi rend="sup">128</hi>
                  </p>
                    </quote> Jefferson's insistence on exact measurement and his obsessive attention to detail betray
                    not a rationality predicated on the practical or the expedient, but a quest for the ideal. When
                    confronted by a choice of practical utility or abstract aesthetics, Jefferson invariably chose the
                    aesthetic and then tried to satisfy the practical within that aesthetic construct. McLaughlin
                    observes that "he was a man who demanded of his life the same symmetry he found in the
                    Newtonian universe he believed in so explicitly." Jefferson assembled data on so many
                    points of interest that McLaughlin concludes that it was something of an end in
                    itself—"a way of fitting these meaningless bits into a rational system was a way
                    of structuring and ordering his personal universe."<hi rend="sup">130</hi>

            <p>Jefferson arranged the thousands of books in his personal library according to a scheme established

                    was derived from broader principles. Architectural drawings conformed to the pure absolutes of
                    mathematical symmetry; library organization conformed to the logic of man's thought processes; even
                    the retention of pea seeds recognized the virtue of frugality.</p>
            <p>Jefferson's passion for ideas and his conviction that ideas formed the basis of social order made it
                    extremely unlikely that he could perpetuate the cruel institution of slavery and rationalize its
                    continuation if he believed that it was inconsistent with his political beliefs and their
                    expression, at least in part, in the government of his society. As John Lauritz Larson notes,
                    Jefferson at times became a victim of his own ideological rhetoric. Fearing the
                    "monarchist" leanings of the Federalist uses of government power, he emphasized
                    his preferences for limited government, eventually restricting his own abilities, and those of his
                    followers, to serve the public good.<hi rend="sup">134</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Jefferson's ideology did eventually trap him within a system in which he was forced to accept a
                    tragic consequence rather than to encourage a restructuring of a society that had come to accept his
                    conceptions of government power and social law. Slavery was an evil, but its eradication could have
                    been a greater evil, not only in the social, political, or economic effects of abolition, but in the
                    restructuring <list type="footnotes">

                    slavery would have necessitated an expansion of governmental authority to legislate the social
                    arrangements, property values, and moral construction of the society. This would have been
                    inconsistent with Jefferson's political ideology. Jefferson could never have endorsed the growth of
                    federal government authority necessary to dictate political change to the states. Neither would he
                    have tolerated state officials determining public policy contrary to the wishes of the majority or
                    judges pronouncing positions contrary to established law. Once established, laws on slavery could
                    not be changed by the moral opposition of a political or legal elite. Morton Horowitz contends that
                    the common law in eighteenth-century America was a fixed body of law applied to individual cases and
                    that judges could not use the law to effect social change.<hi rend="sup">135</hi> Jefferson decried
                    the growing power of nineteenth-century judges in developing legal positivism from the bench. His
                    legal ideal remained the eighteenth-century model. For either a judge or a governor to assume the
                    position of an enlightened leader, abolishing slavery in the best interests of the society and
                    contrary to popular sentiment, was antithetical to the constitutional republicanism that defined
                    Jefferson's political ideology. Any change in a state's position on slavery would have to come
                    through its legislature and then accord a due respect for the property rights of slaveholders.
                    Jefferson's proposals on abolition did just that; he recognized, however, that they would not gain
                    popular acceptance in his lifetime.</p>
            <p>The question then remains: given this set of beliefs, what could the historical actor have been
                    expected to do with regard to a certain issue? In the case of Jefferson and slavery, given the man's
                    political ideology premised on the primacy of law, limited government, states' rights, property
                    rights, and majority rule, there was little more he could have done to abolish the hated
                    institution. Had he tried Jefferson would have breached one of his basic beliefs, which would have
                    proved to be more inconsistent with his ideology than his position of waiting for the next
                    generation to abolish slavery.</p>
            <p>In this context then, Jefferson's position on slavery is not the great example of his intellectual
                    inconsistency but rather of his ideological consistency. Furthermore, the legal and ideological
                    factors that limited Jefferson also limited the nation. Ironically, the most democratic country on
                    earth was the last western nation to abolish slavery, perhaps because of its democracy. Enfranchised
                    Americans never used their political voice to express enough hatred of slavery to eliminate it. When
                    widespread emancipation did occur, it came not through normal political means but by unprecedented
                    use of the president's <list type="footnotes">

            <p>It would be interesting to find out when and why American readers begin their historical
                    acquaintances with Thomas Jefferson. There is certainly no shortage of opportunities when one
                    considers the enormous flock of books about the man. Given this flood of ink, it is reasonable to
                    suspect that very many Americans, academic and otherwise, do indeed search out Jefferson at some
                    time or other. I am no exception, although I may have been a bit late. Not until well along in my
                    graduate studies of the American Revolution did Jefferson become more than a name for schools. Even
                    then it was almost accidental, for I decided one year to give Lester Cappon's edition of the letters
                    of John Adams and Thomas Jefferson to my father as a present.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> He read them with
                    great interest and thus began a conversation between father and son that lasted for the rest of our
                    years together, my father always siding vigorously with Jefferson and I usually with Adams.
                    Coincidentally, my historical interests would take me to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>'s revolution. In this way, Jefferson soon became part of a larger narrative, a story
                    that has served to sustain those first conversations with my father. I suspect there is a private
                    side that explains at least part of what brings every biographer to Jefferson, and Joseph Ellis's
                    history with Jefferson certainly has its own marks of distinctiveness, elements that he does not
                    mask.</p>
            <p>Like so many serious students of American history before him, Ellis took up study of Jefferson with
                    mixed emotions. In mitigation he brings with him previous biographical ventures where he has limned
                    many of the most showy American founders.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Ellis, like Jefferson, calls <placeName>

                    </placeName> his place of beginning. Ellis, like Jefferson's famous critic, Henry Adams, begins his
                    history of Jefferson after having spent years concerned more immediately with the affairs of the
                    Adams family. And Ellis, like many American historians and biographers <list type="footnotes">

                    acknowledging at the same time that those before him who were so intrepid as to enter the home
                    grounds of the historical Jefferson were certainly not afraid to take risks. Such an enterprise is
                    comparable in a metaphoric sense to many immigrants who ventured out from all over the globe seeking
                    a home in a country whose character has become so intimately connected with Jefferson. Ellis, again
                    like so many immigrants, depends heavily upon those who came before, those pioneer biographers
                    starting with Henry Adams and later Dumas Mal-one and Merrill Peterson.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> While
                    acknowledging his indebtedness to these predecessors, Ellis intentionally strikes out for new
                    territory. His journey, while occasionally bright with future promise, exhibits also the
                    difficulties of a complex landscape for which no adequate maps exist. There is finally the question
                    of destinations—considerations of whom Ellis is writing for and why he seeks the audience
                    that he does and considerations of Ellis's construction of a distinctive and new Jefferson.</p>
            <p>In his earlier character study of John Adams, Ellis showed a willingness to build upon previous
                    treatments of that neglected founder. It is significant that both Adams and Jefferson have the
                    benefit of prodigious editorial projects, each in its own way a distinguished contribution to the
                    understanding of the life and times of the subject. That Ellis has made a close study of older
                    biographies is clear, if for no other reason than that throughout the Jefferson biography he
                    exhibits two commendable restraints. First, he avoids hagiography, and second, he refrains from
                    precious criticism of hagiographers. Also, he chose to publish at a propitious moment in
                    Jeffersonian time, for 1992 marked the two hundred-fiftieth anniversary of Jefferson's birth, an
                    occasion that provoked a good deal of celebration, both scholarly and popular. Jefferson's own

                    biography arrived at an auspicious moment, a time cluttered with remembrance and so a time that
                    served also as an enticement for any uncommon voice, the better to be heard in this new outpouring
                    of Jeffersoniana. Given this context, the winning of the National Book Award by <hi rend="i">American Sphinx: The Character of Thomas Jefferson</hi> represented a notable endorsement of
                    Ellis's biographical art.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not at all surprising, these studies and celebrations of Jefferson have in themselves become the
                    occasion for commentary, some in the form of reviews.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> This recent wave almost
                    moves a person to wonder if Jefferson biographical moments are themselves part of a more permanent
                    rhythm of American history. Whether this be something to ponder, the fact is that any person in
                    search of the historical Jefferson is faced with a wealth and a welter of commentaries. After all is
                    said, selection remains a problem for many readers who begin with serious questions about this much
                    remembered man. Even for Ellis, selection poses a major problem. Defining his own methodology as
                    "cinematic," he claims that "another full-scale, multivolume
                    narrative" would be redundant. So Ellis selects what he believes were "the
                    propitious moments" to reveal "the character" of Thomas Jefferson.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> Of course, Ellis, whether he realizes it or not, was hardly the first to
                    approach Jefferson in bits and pieces. Henry Adams actually endorsed such a methodology when he
                    claimed that Jefferson "possessed a character which showed itself in acts."<hi rend="sup">9</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The five special stopping places for Ellis are Jefferson's participation in the second Continental
                    Congress, which culminated in the drafting of the Declaration of Independence; his tour as
                    ambassador to <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>, 1784-1789; his years "in exile" at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Monticello</settlement>
                    </placeName>, 1794-1797; his first term as president, 1801-1804; and his final years, 1816-1826. As
                    matters turn out, the details of Jefferson's life trump Ellis as more and more of these selected
                    "moments" become filled with connecting stories that fit equally as well into
                    other periods of Jefferson's life. So in the end, each moment is really a series of moments crafted
                    to fit together in a seamless narrative that promises to reveal a historical Jefferson as Ellis
                    contends none of his predecessors has managed to do. The chosen segments soon take on the appearance
                    of contrivance, sometimes artfully charming and at other times literary occasion for what appears to
                    be the masking of an incomplete biographical narrative. Introducing and concluding these
                    well-crafted moments is an <list type="footnotes">

                    outlines the contemporary rush of popular and scholarly interest in his subject. This discussion
                    also serves as stage for Ellis's personal reflection on the meaning of Jefferson in American history
                    and his declaration to the reader of how he intends to treat both Jefferson and this most recent
                    "Jeffersonian Surge." Announcing that he strives to be in the company of the best
                    Jefferson commentators who preceded him, Ellis realizes that his mission is delicate indeed, for
                    Jefferson's real story is distinct and separate from the static living image on permanent display at
                    the Jefferson Memorial, Mount Rushmore, and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Monticello</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He acknowledges that "the Jefferson image is safely enshrined in the national
                    memory." So Ellis believes that "it is safe to get to know him as he really
                    was." Having asserted this intention, which many will greet as a clarion call to
                    objectivity, Ellis veers. As he limns his portrait, he seeks what he views as the most revealing
                    features. Ellis emphasizes that "the essence of his story" ought to show that
                    "unlike <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, he was never a legend in his own time, always a controversial figure who combined
                    great depth with great shallowness, massive learning with extraordinary naivete, piercing insights
                    into others with daunting powers of self-deception. His flaws, in other words, should be just as
                    interesting as his strengths, and the way they interacted with one another, as he, like all of us,
                    managed his way through life, not his inexorable growth toward greatness."<hi rend="sup">10</hi> Henry Adams would not necessarily have disagreed with this, but he might have suggested
                    that such a disclaimer was a useless stab. Adams cast the question of the relation of Americans to
                    Jefferson differently: "This sandy face, with hazel eyes and sunny aspect; this loose,
                    shackling person; this rambling and often brilliant conversation, belonged to the controlling
                    influences of American history, more necessary to the story than three-fourths of the official
                    papers, which only hid the truth."<hi rend="sup">11</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When historians select, however, even in so pleasantly plausible a way as Ellis does, there arises a
                    problem of trust, challenging readers to know enough even before starting to secure an intellectual
                    beachhead from which to operate. Often the sands on that beach are shifting—intellectual
                    fashions change; historical reputations ebb and flow; and the huckstering blurbs of booksellers'
                    advice are often mostly wind. After his death on July 4, 1826, a memorable anniversary that marked
                    the exit of John Adams as well, Jefferson has become a special magnet for ensuing legions of
                    historical admirers and detractors. Through the years various other famous Americans also became
                    cottage industries in a historical profession often mindful of the need <list type="footnotes">

                    all of this industry Jefferson has maintained an elevated place, in its own way not unlike the site
                    he selected for his home, adroitly removed from the fray. Why this has been so becomes a lesson in
                    the history of American history, some cynics going so far as to suggest that if "the
                    American Sphinx" did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him.</p>
            <p>In an irony Jefferson might have enjoyed, he has become a lightning rod of a distinctive sort in the
                    late twentieth century. The post-World War II launching of the Jefferson Papers, not even half
                    complete after a half-century in business, served to prompt a peculiarly bifurcated course for the
                    history of American history. On the one side grew up a new community, largely outside of the
                    established groves of the academy, a community of scholars where entire professional careers were
                    given over to the preservation and publication of the letters and papers of great individuals or
                    special subjects such as abolition of slavery, ratification of the Constitution, and the first
                    federal congress. Federal funding was critical in sustaining this grand departure. On the other
                    side, academic historians, newly divorced from close association with documentary editors, embraced
                    historical writing that became more interpretive with the passing of the years, reflected in part by
                    the gradual disappearance in the classroom of history courses organized around and driven by primary
                    sources.</p>
            <p>The historical memory of Thomas Jefferson has been both beneficiary and victim of this development.
                    With the letterpress, film, and digital publication of records came exaggerated expectations that
                    historical writing would be grounded securely upon the evidence. Interestingly, documentary
                    publication served simultaneously to loosen the speculative urges as more and more historians
                    engaged in the art of the extended essay—or history as argument. In time, the scholarship
                    of American history became bifurcated as the monuments to archival memory struggled to coexist with
                    a Babel of increasingly arcane studies that suited the whims of the currently fashionable.</p>
            <p>It is a daunting task for anyone who sets out to get a hand around the subject of Jefferson in
                    American history. The number of people who have tried gives pause. Some have compiled bibliographies
                    of secondary sources; collections of primary sources also abound; and then there are the studies of
                    the studies. Here readers have been treated to Merrill Peterson's <hi rend="i">The Jefferson Image
                        in the American Mind</hi> (1960). Peterson recognized something important in historiography

                    Americans over such a long period of time felt somehow compelled to come to terms with Jefferson as
                    well as other founders. During the Revolution, Americans did away with both monarchy and birthright
                    aristocracy. Interestingly, Jefferson himself was politically most assertive in this stripping away
                    of the dead hand of artificial privilege. Simultaneously, Americans yearned for icons worthy of
                    their new order; so the founding fathers in general and Jefferson in particular soon became the
                    objects of historical apotheosis. Once this happened and as Americans continued in the twentieth
                    century to expand the geography of history, the image of Jefferson worked its way into virtually
                    every historical consideration of the Revolution and the new nation.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> It is
                    into this modern minefield of scholarly complexity that Ellis has journeyed in search of his
                    "chief quarry," one, he believed, that had eluded his predecessors in what many
                    considered the most important challenge ever to face American historians— making sense of

            <p>In human action there are masks and there are fictions. Some of these masks and fictions are
                    carefully designed for the construction of useful objects. Manners, for example, are often masks of
                    careful social design, as are corporations in the law. Fictions serve clever humorists as well as
                    those caretakers of the law who craft special cases in property and tort to accommodate the
                    tradition of legal forms and social progress simultaneously. There has always been a dark side as
                    well. Here slavery has ranked as a most ingeniously pernicious mask in the law, the intentional
                    construct of something naturally wrong. Robert Penn <placeName>

                    Ellis's portrayal of Jefferson is centered on different polarities than those conjured up by
                    fictions and masks. According to Ellis, Jefferson masked himself from himself, finally unable to

                    icy grandeur of his carefully crafted ideals. Ellis's portrait of Jefferson's character focuses upon
                    the contest that raged within, the contest between the ideal and the real. This was on exhibit
                    whether the subject was executive authority in the person of a king or a president, the authority of
                    the government to address the power that came from wealth, or the authority of one individual over
                    the life of another, free and slave. Ellis believes that this contest of Jefferson's was fated to
                    end in disappointment. The romantic aspirations of his better self were destined to be defeated by
                    outsiders who employed the world view of Thomas Hobbes as their weapon.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>

                    </placeName>, 1775-76," culminates with a discussion of the Declaration of Independence.
                    Using quotations from previous Jefferson historians and others as epigraphs for each chapter,
                    Ellis's evocative and trenchant choice for this segment comes from Malone: "It is easier to
                    reach a confident opinion about the sort of man he was in 1776 than to do so for 1793 or
                    1800." Not only will Ellis test this enigmatic proposition in coming chapters, he also uses
                    this chapter to establish the central features of Jefferson's character. In short, this is the
                    critical moment for the biographer's art. None will doubt the importance of what the biographer
                    chooses to remember as he sets about establishing this foundation. Given the richness of the various
                    sources available to Ellis, the view of Jefferson in 1776 can also be seen in those features of
                    Jefferson's character and activities that Ellis chose to omit. Since this study departs from the
                    biographical genre known as "life and times," the biography becomes, at least in
                    part, an exercise in the art of concealment, all in the name of asserting as Ellis does that his
                    selective construction reveals historical truth. If this appears oxymoronic, welcome to a world
                    where "fiction" has entered the vocabulary as an acceptable fashion in historical
                    writing, and deconstruction—or the new relativism—is considered intellectually
                    safe from the sort of treatment that wits such as H. L. Mencken or Mark Twain might have savored.</p>
            <p>With the Declaration of Independence as the destination, Ellis views much of what transpired before
                    as prologue. The young Jefferson was both an inward person, one who might be viewed as a loner
                    today, and a political idealist, one who attached himself with great conviction to the
                    Enlightenment's faith in reason.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> Ellis claims that this combination of

                    meant a person who "is apt to be very wise in his own conceit, and is often so enamored
                    with the supposed beauty of his own ideal plan of government, that he cannot suffer the smallest
                    deviation from any part of it." Smith, of course, worried that such a person tended to see
                    human beings as things to be manipulated, like so many pieces on a "chess

            <p>Starting with the first chapter and continuing throughout his study, Ellis contends with the
                    historiographically heretical notion of a Jefferson inclined toward something other than individual
                    liberty. Beginning with his analysis of the Declaration, continuing later with Jefferson's reception
                    of the French Revolution, and culminating with the evolution of Jefferson's concepts of both Native
                    Americans and Africans, Ellis develops this interpretation. Ellis probes the implications of the
                    deep conflict caused by Jefferson's character with considerable sympathy and discernment toward both
                    Jefferson and Jefferson's biographers. But probe he does as when he concludes the discussion of the
                    Declaration by suggesting it "represented yet another formulation of the Jeffersonian
                    imagination." As much as Jefferson was indebted to John Locke or the political philosophers
                    of the Scottish Enlightenment for conceptions of the ideal society,</p>
            <quote rend="blockquote">
                    <p>the urge to embrace such an ideal society came from deep inside Jefferson himself. It was the
                        vision of a young man projecting his personal cravings for a world in which all behavior was
                        voluntary and therefore all coercion unnecessary, where independence and equality never
                        collided, where the sources of all authority were invisible because they had already been
                        internalized. Efforts on the part of scholars to determine whether Jefferson's prescriptive
                        society was fundamentally individualistic or communal can never reach closure, because within
                        the Jeffersonian utopia such choices do not need to be made. They reconcile themselves
                        naturally…. Jefferson's political vision was more radical than liberal, driven as it
                        was by a youthful romanticism unwilling to negotiate its high standards with an imperfect
                            world.<hi rend="sup">18</hi>

            <p>As Ellis approaches what he considers to be Jefferson's center, he presents a historical player
                    doomed to disappointment, if not failure. Perhaps this is more a reflection of Ellis's own
                    conception of the destiny of the American Revolution, interesting but largely irrelevant in a
                    biography seeking to reveal Jefferson's character.</p>

                        instrument for reshaping life, not for reflecting it in some grand cosmic design."
                        Peterson, <hi rend="i">Thomas Jefferson</hi>, 45-46. Forrest McDonald opposed this view, stating
                        that Jefferson had achieved the construction of an ideology, "a system of values and a

            <p>Some may find elements of this presentation disingenuous, as if Ellis had tried to have things both
                    ways. Others might chime in with calls for Ellis to give better notice to earlier biographical and
                    monographic studies of the early years. Jefferson as well left some hints in an unpublished
                    autobiography, a personal history he began during January, 1821, "for the information of my
                    family," a major writing task never finished and a source that Ellis does not emphasize.
                    The autobiography reveals two remarkable stones about Jefferson and the coming of the Revolution,
                    the actual apprenticeship for Jefferson's contributions to the Continental Congress in 1775 and
                    1776. In recalling his tenure as a member of the House of Burgesses, Jefferson noted his dual role,
                    one as legislator and one as leader of the patriot cause.</p>

                    Marshall. Even so, his legal scholarship as well as several of his opinions for the General Court,
                    particularly on the question of the Fee Bill and court closure in 1774, reflected in significant

                    understand Jefferson's public career as well as his private character it is necessary to consider
                    his investment in the law. If Cicero and Montaigne served as his models in the world of letters for
                    addressing friends and acquaintances, then Coke, Black-stone, and the world of the Enlightenment
                    became mentors for his public career. Ellis fails to emphasize these inspirations as he probes the
                    distinctions between the public and private that Jefferson crafted so carefully.</p>
            <p>The law informed Jefferson's view of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>

                        Summary View of the Rights of British America</hi> (1774), which Ellis contends served as the
                    primary backdrop for his draft of the Declaration. Once he completed his legal education and started
                    his appellate practice, Jefferson began to keep notes of certain cases in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>'s highest appellate court. Although these reports were not published until several
                    years after he died, he had earlier penned a short introduction that conveyed views central in his
                    political thought. Assembling notes on earlier decisions and compiling reports of cases between 1768
                    and 1772, Jefferson stated that his principle of selection was straightforward. He considered the
                    decisions of the General Court "on our peculiar laws" to have been "of
                    conclusive authority. As precedents, they established authoritatively the construction of our own
                    enactments, and gave them the shape and meaning, under which our property has been ever since

                    </placeName>'s distinctive legal history goes a long way in explaining Jefferson's keen interest in
                    statutory codification. His association with Edmund Pendleton was particularly important. Early in
                    1774 Jefferson won a significant political and legal battle with this man who would take executive
                    charge of <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s move to independence during the critical months after June, 1774. The General Court
                    requested both these men, one the young and unseasoned Jefferson and the other among the foremost
                    attorneys practicing in the General Court, to give opinions about whether the court could remain
                    open if the legislature failed to pass statutory rates for court fees. Jefferson argued that it
                    could not, and the court accepted his view. Although the evidence is incomplete, this may have
                    sealed both Jefferson's claim to leadership within the patriot party and a lasting friendship with
                    Pendleton. These alliances, forged as they were during the most trying of times, suggest a Jefferson
                    who was extraordinarily active, in some ways the perfect portrait of the new <placeName>

                    purposeful. His engagements, at once politically risky and personally emphatic, suggest anything but

            <p>It is notable that of all the American patriots who embraced the tenets of the Enlightenment, none
                    was more learned in the law than Jefferson. Few could match the manner in which he joined his legal
                    scholarship with the politics of the Revolution.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> In his codification of the

                    </placeName>, Jefferson's learning and political interests converged in the creation of a new legal
                    order, perhaps the most significant example of his unequaled capacity to fuse philosophy and
                    political action. In his study of Jefferson's constitutional thought, Mayer notes this achievement.
                    While not seeking to dispel the past out of hand, Jefferson sought to select those parts of the
                    statutory law and judge-made, or common, law that would be useful as <placeName>

            <p>Thus this view of the law as a rational instrument for future use was clearly not simply an invention
                    of late nineteenth-century American jurists, given Jefferson's view of this legal imperative for the

                    the modern sense of the term, Mayer does argue that Jefferson viewed this as a singular episode in <placeName>

                    </placeName> legal history. Ellis and others do not connect Jefferson's passionate and sustained

                    Rather than looking at old family debts, as well as those of others who forged American
                    independence—an interpretation so many have argued over the years—Jefferson
                    may have been looking west, seeking to use the past in a consciously selective way so as to give
                    vent to the spontaneous energies of the present. After 1763 Americans came increasingly to see the
                    king in Parliament as an agent using the dead hand of the past to arrest the future that colonists
                    considered vital, hence the bill of particulars in the Declaration.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>

                    often later observers overlooked the circumstances under which Jefferson accepted the position and

                    war-torn state during its darkest hours. Like Patrick Henry before him, Jefferson came to the office
                    from the legislature.<hi rend="sup">29</hi> These years as governor served as a trial that tempered

                    incapacitating the governor at almost every important turn, particularly when it came to the
                    question of emergency powers. His experience as governor during the most critical hours of the war
                    became a signal chapter in the education of Jefferson as an executive. June 1, 1779, marked the
                    beginning of Jefferson's experience as an executive. From the moment he had entered the House of
                    Burgesses until his elevation to governor, he had been a part of the opposition to executive
                    authority. How he handled the difference between being out of power and in power has been a subject
                    of continuing interest. At the conclusion of a significant narrative of Jefferson's two years as

                    of the institution. It was here that he predicted a holocaust of racial war. "Indeed I
                    tremble for my country. When I reflect that God is just: that his justice cannot sleep for ever:
                    that considering numbers, nature and natural means only, a revolution of the wheel of fortune, an
                    exchange of situation, is among possible events; that it may become probable by supernatural
                        interference!"<hi rend="sup">31</hi> According to Ellis these prophetic words, not
                    unlike the introduction to the Declaration, took on a life of their own in Jefferson as well as in
                    American history. Ellis returns to the discussion of slavery during Jefferson's <placeName>

                    </placeName> years, 1794-1797. Here he lists the reasons that he believed persuaded Jefferson to
                    move from the forefront of reform to silence. In addition to the trepidation he felt after the
                    publication of the Notes, Jefferson came to believe that there was no practical solution for
                    emancipation, a view that he may have been attracted to in part because of his growing financial
                    dependence "upon the monetary value and labor of his slaves." The conclusion was
                    tragic for others, for "the net result of all these influences was a somewhat tortured
                    position on slavery that combined unequivocal condemnation of the institution in the abstract with
                    blatant procrastination whenever specific emancipation schemes were suggested."<hi rend="sup">32</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Added to the melancholy of this discussion of slavery was Jefferson's history with Sally Hemings,
                    mulatto daughter of his father-in-law, a history that would hound him and his reputation from the
                    time James Callender published his account in 1802. Sadly, during the time following the publication
                    of this biography, Ellis became embroiled in the politics of impeachment, so much so that some
                    wondered openly if his activities regarding the DNA testing of certain descendants of Thomas
                    Jefferson in an effort to establish his paternity of Hemings's children were politically motivated.
                    If such allegations are true, Ellis's conversion to the belief that Jefferson sired at least one
                    child by Hemings will affect how readers view <hi rend="i">American Sphinx</hi>.<hi rend="sup">33</hi>

                    although he does give a nod to Fawn Brodie's introduction of the thesis that Jefferson and Hemings
                    shared love. He does not stress that many subsequently denied such a relation on the grounds that,
                    given Jefferson's character, the exploitive nature of slavery precluded such a history, one that
                    some suggested began during the exile at <placeName>

            <p>While slavery continues to serve as the leitmotif for so much contemporary scholarship, much of it
                    subjectively politicized, Ellis recognized it as only a part of the complex geography of Jefferson's
                    interior world, a subject that remained privately awful and publicly troubling. This has not been so
                    for others, particularly when current gossip now fueled by DNA science ignites a fury of personal

                    begins with Jefferson's friendship with Abigail Adams and ends with his love for Maria Cosway. When

                    appears bloodless. Jefferson's famous and noteworthy letter to Cosway, "the head and the
                    heart" letter, receives short shrift in Ellis. This is strange in two ways. First, the
                    correspondence revealed the limits of Jefferson's Enlightenment mentality insofar as it reflected
                    accurately his segregation of reason and emotion. Second, Jefferson went to some pains, literally,
                    to save a copy of this letter, suggesting an archival consideration that Ellis could have probed for
                    signals issuing from Jefferson's interior, that precious space that Ellis throughout so fervently

                    inaugural address. Normally, judgments of this kind are understood to be the special preserve for
                    argumentative historians who hunt for meaning in the popularity polls. Even so, to rank the first
                    inaugural address second after the Declaration as the most significant of Jefferson's public
                    statements is not only to give it great emphasis, but also, coming where it does in the middle of
                    the book, to shape the entire work. The context of Ellis's pronouncement has a troublesome ring to
                    it, for his Jefferson from the very first is the least public of all famous American public leaders,
                    a mark of his character that Ellis takes repeated trouble to establish. It becomes one of the
                    central ironies of the biography—that this most famous American, this man who became
                    almost a mythical metaphor for all that was noble in the American political experiment, was in fact
                    reclusive by inclination. Jefferson appeared to avoid the public spotlight as he labored to create
                    an epistolary archive that would assure his hold upon the American historical imagination. Ellis is
                    fond of emphasizing the hidden Jefferson, tantamount in some ways to suggesting that Jefferson
                    became for American public letters what Shakespeare became for all of English
                    literature—the eternal enigma. Or to put it common sensically, how can we know so much
                    about someone who remains so hidden from our view? Since the sphinxlike Jefferson has been so
                    central a part of the Peterson and Ellis viewpoint, the question arises whether this characteristic
                    is at least in part a figment of the biographer's imagination. Simultaneously, of course, American
                    historians have held that no one symbolized the distinctiveness of America more accurately than
                    Jefferson. So, ever since Henry Adams's sweeping portrait of the third president, readers have faced
                    a bifurcated image—on the one side forever hidden and on the other side a looming
                    presence of the quintessential American.<hi rend="sup">36</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Also remaining obscure in Ellis's Jefferson is due consideration for the development of his legal and
                    constitutional thought, the very bedrock of his public character in the opinion of several
                    historians, including Malone and Mayer. Ellis's discussion of the first inaugural is the occasion
                    for a long offset quotation, a profound constitutional and legal claim of Jefferson's that stands
                    without any historical explication from Ellis. The passage is certainly famous: "I believe
                    this, on the contrary, the strongest government on earth. I believe it is the only one where every
                    man, at the call of the laws, would fly to the standard of the law, and would meet invasions of the

                    faith in the new American citizenship, a citizenship founded upon a knowledge of the law and the
                    courage to defend "the laws" against invasion, a high point for his endorsement of
                    an instrumental view of the law.</p>
            <p>Embedded in Jefferson's observation was recognition of the genius of the American Revolution, the
                    distinctiveness of this American achievement that captured with precision the American idea of
                    volitional allegiance. In contrast, from time to time Ellis has Jefferson angrily objecting to the
                    views of his opposition for failing to sustain what Ellis refers to as "the true meaning of
                    the American Revolution."<hi rend="sup">38</hi> Aside from Ellis's willingness to use this
                    as a catchall for Jefferson's reaction to principled opposition, the interpretation lacks clarity,
                    for he never explains "the true meaning." More importantly, Ellis suggests by this
                    that Jefferson remained somehow stuck in 1776—that his constitutional and legal thought
                    was best characterized as static. This is in stark contrast to two separate and important Jefferson
                    events. The first came with Jefferson's willingness to be constitutionally flexible enough to
                    acquire <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName>, an action for which "the true meaning of the American Revolution"
                    might well have been silent. At least Jefferson himself admitted as much in an 1810 letter to John
                    Colvin that Ellis cites: "It is incumbent on those who accept great charges to risk
                    themselves on great occasions,… to lose our country by a scrupulous adherence to written
                    laws, would be to lose the law itself." In defining his presidency Jefferson viewed
                    executive uses of power as dependent in certain ways upon the exigencies of the moment, special
                    occasions when distinctive leaders had to take certain laws into their own hands in order to
                    preserve the law for others. Ellis states that Jefferson "violated his most cherished
                    political principles" in order to acquire territory, a question on which the Constitution
                    remained silent. On the contrary, Mayer, viewing this letter more appropriately from a
                    constitutional rather than a political perspective, emphasized the constitutional void. Mayer
                    noticed also Jefferson's subsequent uses of executive power, particularly in diplomatic affairs,
                    where he continued to hold to an expansive view of executive prerogative. It was Jefferson's
                    aspiration that <placeName>

                    judiciary, particularly John Marshall, and with the institution itself. Ellis presents Jefferson as
                    both single dimensional in his views and on the verge of irrationality whenever he addressed the
                    place of the judiciary in the new American constitutional order. At this point Ellis exhibits his
                    inexperience with American legal history, asserting that Jefferson considered that "the
                    original American revolutionaries had not envisioned a national judiciary at all." Of
                    course, this is disingenuous, given that most participants and leaders during the years 1774 to 1776
                    gave very little, if any, thought to "national" institutions of any kind.
                    Conversely, Mayer presents a more complex Jefferson, whose views changed in response to both the
                    historical development of American constitutional institutions and the stated institutional
                    ambitions of those who differed from his federalism. Again, it is important to distinguish Jefferson
                    in power with Jefferson out of power. Mayer views Jefferson as part of the Whig, or opposition,
                    constitutional tradition, a significant window into the Jeffersonian world that is unopened by
                    Ellis. But those Whig views were a part of Jefferson when he was in opposition, as he was so much of
                    the time when the federal judiciary was making such great institutional strides during Marshall's
                    tenure as chief justice of the Supreme Court. From almost the beginning, according to Mayer,
                    Jefferson maintained a jealousy of the jurisdiction claimed by Marshall, preferring to emphasize the
                    resolution of constitutional disputes either at the state level or in the elected branches of the
                    national government.<hi rend="sup">40</hi>

            <p>Several biographers and constitutional historians have noted the importance of Jefferson's
                    contributions to the American discussion of sovereignty. Beginning with his political opposition to
                    the crown and continuing during his initial contributions as a legislator and governor, Jefferson in
                    both his private and public correspondence joined others in the patriot cause as together they began
                    to frame a new American understanding of governmental power. Using different historical sources from
                    Europe and America, these new constitutionalists forged often conflicting definitions of sovereignty
                    during the final decades of the eighteenth century. As Mayer and others have argued, Jefferson's
                    views were neither static nor consistent. Even so, his contribution to the constitutionalism of
                    divided sovereignty and the limiting of centralized power that he made in the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Resolutions of 1798 receives no attention from Ellis. The reader comes away from this
                    book, then, with no understanding of either Jefferson's long-standing interest in defining the
                    limits of state power or in establishing new American standards of citizenship. To avoid these
                    considerations is to leave blank a central feature of Jefferson's public character.</p>

            <p>In the history of western civilization the American Revolution stands out not only because of the
                    remarkable Declaration of Independence and the ensuing rush of written constitutions, but also
                    because very quietly added to them was a revolutionary consideration of time and space. Jefferson
                    became a knowing participant, indeed an important designer, of this transformation, which explains
                    at least in part why his character and his life remain sphinxlike or lost to some twentieth-century
                    biographers. In contrast, Henry Adams began his history of Jefferson's presidency with a chapter on
                    the American West, or what he considered America's future. By 1800 the West beckoned the East
                    forward, not the other way around. The American West became in Jefferson's mind the remedy for the
                    past with all of its political and legal encumbrances, its artificial barriers to the creative
                    energies of individuals. Jefferson's faith in the promise of the American future was revealed in his
                    drafting of the original Northwest Ordinance, in his willingness to chance the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName> Purchase, and in his prompting the expedition of Lewis and Clark. For Donald Jackson in
                    his <hi rend="i">Thomas Jefferson and the Stony Mountains: Exploring the West from <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Monticello</settlement>
                        </placeName>
               </hi> (1981), this vision that Jefferson carried of American time and space was a
                    central part of his American character. For Ellis this subject remains on the periphery—a
                    story that could wait until the end of his biography and be told in bits and snippets without
                    enthusiasm.</p>
            <p>In his final years Jefferson by most accounts was not happy. The reasons for this vary with the
                    storyteller. For some, such as Ellis, the question of personal happiness is not a question even in
                    the discussion of Jefferson's earlier years. Perhaps biographers are inclined to accept the notion
                    that happiness should be an attribute of the declining years, a compensation for the unwelcome
                    demise of other emotions. The bright spot in Jefferson's last chapter, of course, was the
                    construction of the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, according to Ellis a fitting finale for his idealism. Jefferson, too, valued this
                    accomplishment, electing to remind the future as he chose it to conclude his epitaph. Ellis is not
                    so sure of this ranking. For him there is very little of Jefferson's dark side in Jefferson's other
                    choices for his tombstone, the Declaration of Independence and the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> statute of religious liberty. But in the founding of the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> "several old and familiar Jeffersonian patterns also presented themselves,
                    like characters in a play reappearing for a final encore."<hi rend="sup">41</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Up until his end, Jefferson continued to live for the grand ideal while suffering from the slings and
                    arrows of the outrages visited by a fortune more practical. With his eye focused on the end design,
                    Jefferson got caught up in such details as surveying the site for the university; developing a
                    catalog for the library; drawing up architectural <list type="footnotes">

                    minutiae; and recruiting faculty—always the conflicting dichotomy between the ideal and
                    the real, the speculative and the administrative. In short, Ellis wonders whether these conflicts
                    defeated Jefferson's best self, the public figure he labored so hard to construct. At the end, there
                    was also a dark note on Jefferson's commitment to liberty. He became intensely involved in the
                    development of the curriculum for the new college. Long a supporter of new courses on practical
                    subjects and new identifications for professorial positions, Jefferson became adamant on the subject
                    of barring theology from the curriculum. This denial, masked as a tribute to academic freedom and
                    individual liberty of choice, failed to hide the assault upon inquiry into ideas and convictions
                    central to the quest for liberty throughout much of the history of western civilization. In the
                    final analysis it was not what Jefferson promoted but what he denied that put a particular stamp on
                    his legacy. This concept of a state-sponsored university possessed of such power to limit and
                    control inquiry surfaced with great force by the end of the nineteenth century. It is a design that
                    has provided a guiding star for the direction of the secular public university in modern times. From
                    his observation post at a private college, Ellis is disinclined to comment upon the consequences of
                    this side of Jefferson's character and so depicts a Jefferson still unfocused, robbing the subject
                    of his own story and American readers of clear historical memory.</p>
