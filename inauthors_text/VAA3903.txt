					AND NOW IT IS REVEALED UNTO YOU-
				
				Friends, whom the author esteems as genuine, said: "Why don't you put them into
					a book?"
				Acquaintances added a handclasp to their declarations that they liked my verses because
					they were "so human."
				A little boy telephoned on occasional Saturday evenings and said: "I liked
					today's best of all."
				And I like some of them myself.
				Out of it all has grown this simple volume composed of verses printed in The Indianapolis
					News under the captions of "Songs of the City Streets" and "Ballads of the
					Byways."

					THE EXILES
					
						WE'VE got to leave the old home, wife,
						Be exiles, you and I;
						To these broad fields we've loved so long
						We've got to say good-by.
						The old farm doesn't need us now;
						It only laughs, my mate,
						At us two poor, old-fashioned folks
						Since it's got up-to-date.
						It used to be dependent, dear,
						On these old hands of ours;
						Mine to tend its grain and grass,
						Yours its fruit and flowers.
						For when we came and settled here,
						And knew life's hardest bumps,
						This big, swell-headed farm of ours
						Grew nothing else but stumps.
						
						Then-then there came that luckless time,
						That sad, ill-omened day
						We brought our first self-binder home
						And threw the scythe away.
						And ever since that time, Louise,
						We've squandered all our means
						To give this farm its swinging gates
						And patent-right machines.
						Alas!-for our indulgence, dear-
						We're banished into town,
						Though we had hoped that here
						We'd see life's golden sun go down.
						The old place-how we've loved it-
						Doesn't need us any more
						Since automatic hands perform
						The tasks we did of yore.
						
						The windmill pumps the water now;
						It churns the butter, too,
						And incubators do the work
						Your old hens used to do.
						A motor grinds the cattle feed;
						It likewise shears the sheep
						That patent locks protect at night
						When they lie down to sleep.
						The rural-route man brings the mail
						And leaves it at the door,
						Thus making void my last excuse
						To loaf down at the store.
						The trolley brings the groceries-
						We phone for them, you know-
						And parlor films have made our home
						A moving-picture show.
						
						The shredder shreds the corn and me,
						The rail fence now is wire,
						And some one's sold you some new scheme
						To cook without a fire.
						We light the house with tanked-up gas,
						It lights the big barn, too,
						And threshing-time has lost its charm
						With salaried boss and crew.
						Machinery cuts and loads the hay,
						Then stows it in the mow,
						And-last and worst-they've found a way
						To patent-milk the cow.
						So come, let's journey townward, dear,
						We're laid upon the shelf-
						The old farm's got so dog-goned smart
						That it can run itself!
					
				
				
				
					TWO MEN OF THE ROAD
					
						T WO men there were whose journey lay
						Down green, tree-bordered paths to-day,
						But one had eyes that would not see
						The wayside's art-divinity.
						He thought but of the motor's grind,
						Of clouded miles he'd leave behind;
						He had no mission save to say
						He'd gone so many miles to-day.
						The beauty of the woodland's dress
						To him was hazy nothingness.
						Just once a grim smile lit his face-
						A fool-bird dared to set him pace!
						A fool-bird-poor, misguided wight-
						Dared taunt him to a test of flight.
						Thus on and on he blithely sped,
						His only goal-the miles ahead!
						
						He did not see beside the road
						Another man who calmly strode
						Amid the shade of glade and glen,
						Then back into the road again.
						He did not see the old man's eyes
						Grow glad and twinkle with surprise
						When out there hopped a friendly toad
						To blink at him across the road.
						He did not near Bob White's refrain
						Come echoing from down the lane;
						He did not catch the plowboy's yell
						Of welcome to the dinner bell.
						He did not hear the old man sigh
						In pity as he hurried by-
						He did not see him stoop to get
						God's sweetest thing-a violet!
					
				
				
				
				
				
					TIMOTHY MACKESSYCop Number One
					
						TIMOTHY MACKESSY, Cop Number One!
						Good-natured, round-f'atured son of a gun!
						Always a-smilin', at fri'nd an' foe-
						If the last named he's anny, not one do I know.
						Old folks an' young folks, the fat ones an' slim
						Shout whin they see him: "Begorra, there's Tim!"
						All of thim like him, this rev'ler in fun-
						Timothy Mackessy, Cop Number One!
					
					
						Timothy Mackessy, Cop Number One!
						It's more good than harm our Timothy's done.
						
						
						
						Down by the depot with smiles on his face
						He p'ints all the strangers to Monument Place.
						He hunts all the babies the mothers have lost
						An' holds up the cyars till the ladies have crossed.
						It's only the blackgyards that Timmy will shun-
						Timothy Mackessy, Cop Number One!
					
					
						Timothy Mackessy, Cop Number One!
						D'aler in jokes that are all Irish spun.
						He bosses the Tunnel an' calls it his cave
						An' says whin he dies, shure he'll make it his grave.
						But thim that knows Timmy just laugh an' reply:
						"Begorra, Tim, lad, you're too jov'al to die!"
						So live on forever, Apostle of Fun-
						Timothy Mackessy, Cop Number One!
					
				
				
				
					THE SHOW PARADE
					
						YOUTH came back to my door to-day,
						Youth, the fugitive; Youth, the gay,
					
					
						Came with smiles and a twinkling eye,
						Bringing me dreams of days gone by.
					
					
						It called me out to a wayside street
						Where children, merry as they were sweet,
					
					
						Bade me witness-and I obeyed-
						Their "grandly marvelous show parade!"
					
					
						And then there passed in gay review
						Three little girls and Rummy, too;
					
					
						Rummy, the dog, the friend, the clown,
						With sunbonnet on, but upside down;
					
					
						Wagons and buggies and boxes tied
						With Tabbies and dolls and toys inside.
					
					
						Truly a picture to start the flow
						Of tear-brewed dreams of a long ago.
					
					
					
						Now, through the mist of bygone years,
						Our old barn-lot and its show appears.
					
					
						I see, in fancy, bright quilt tepees,
						Rag-carpet tents and a broom trapeze.
					
					
						I hear old Skeeter, my fellow clown,
						Wail at my painting his eyelids brown.
					
					
						It broke up the show-and I got mine!--
						For the paint we used was iodine!
					
					
						But that was part of the show, you see,
						Of Red and Skeeter and Sis and Me;
					
					
						Part of the tortures suffered then
						That all, I know, would bear again
					
					
						Could we, once more, go back and play
						Saturday circus-but, here, well, say,
					
					
						Children, forgive me, for I've delayed
						With Yesterday's dreams To-day's parade!
					
				
				
				
				
				
					 MATRIMONY A LA CARTE
					
						A LADY ees come to my cart,
						Wheech standa een da street,
						She buy banan' an' evratheeng
						So gooda an' so sweet!
						On Market day she always come
						An' we mak' friendla fun
						'Bout w'at I do w'en I geet reech
						An' gotta plenta mon'.
						She say: "I bet you some day, Mike,
						W'en you ees wealtha man,
						You geeta stuck on pooty girl
						Wheech ees a 'Merican."
						But I say: "No, you mak' mistak',
						Dat theeng can nevra be,
						Eef I am gon' for geet a wife
						She come from Eetaly!"
						Den she ees look so mad an' say:
						"Poor Mike, you foolish guy,
						You should have wife bak' Bosta' bean
						An' mak' you gooda pie!"
						
						
						
						I say: "My goodness, how you talk,
						So pooty an' so swell,
						You sounda like you leeve yourself
						Een granda, beeg hotel!"
						She say: "Aw, w'at's a matta you?
						You mak' me sucha seeck;
						W'en 'Merican got bumma cook
						He mak' wan louda keeck.
						Een deesa countra life ees sweet
						An' we want queeck for die
						Eef on da table eet ees not
						Some Bosta' bean an' pie!"
						My, my, she got me sucha bluff
						I not know w'at to say,
						But I am feex for her nex' time
						She come on Market day.
						I say: "Go 'way, you 'Mericans,
						You can no cook I bet,
						So sweet, so good, like Dago girls,
						Eyetalian spaghett'!"
					
				
				
				
					THE DOWN-TRAIN TO MADISON
					
						I'VE been as far east as Altoony;
						my west mark, I think, is K. C.,
						But distance ain't been my ambition-
						just leave out globe-trottin' fer me.
						I'll let you ride 'round in th' Pullmans
						an' revel in dinin' car fare-
						Th' Down-train to Madison's my train-
						I'll do all my travelin' there!
						You ain't been, you say? Well, you've
						missed it an' ought to go soon as you can,
						That is, if you're not in a hurry an' live
						on th' sociable plan.
					
					
						Th' Down-train goes down in th' mornin',
						a-weekdays an' Sundays as well;
						Th' Up-train comes back in th' evenin'-
						but here's what I'm trying' to tell;
						
						Th' Down-train's the Neighborly Special,
						unmarred by luxurious frill,
						It gathers up folks from Columbus
						clear down to old Madison Hill.
						They git on at 'Liztown an' Hege,
						at Scipio, Vernon an' Wirt;
						They hop 'er at Queensville an' Grayford,
						but nobody ever gits hurt.
					
					
						It's just like a family reunion
						to board th' old Madison train;
						You'll meet up with comrades an' kinfolks,
						you'll chuckle at sweetheart an' swain.
						Bill Moody will git on at Dupont
						an' joke at old 'Zekiel York
						'Bout bein' so crooked he reckons
						that Zeke'll git off at th' Fork.
						Then Zeke will git back at Bill's jokin'
						an' make th' suggestion that Bill
						
						
						
						Ain't one-half as straight as th' roundhouse
						that stands on old Madison Hill.
					
					
						Here neighbor says "Howdy" to neighbor,
						then turns th' seat over so's he
						Can talk of th' crops an' th' weather
						an' how times are likely to be.
						Th' Down-train is Fellership's agent,
						a trait to be truly admired;
						Th' Up-train comes back in th' evenin'
						when every one's hungry an' tired.
						An' so it's th' Down-train I sing of-
						repellin' all worry an' strife-
						A symbol of Youth, you might call it,
						that runs through th' Mornin' of Life.
					
				
				
				
					THE OLD RED PUMP ON THE CORNER
					
						OLD Red Pump on the Corner!
						Here's to your matchless brew;
						You with a job like a woman's-
						Never an end in view.
						Morning and noon and evening
						Your arm extends to greet
						The tired and thirsty thousands
						Of the hot and dusty street.
						Friend of both prig and prelate
						Foe not to race or creed,
						Yours is a holy mission-
						To give men the drink they need.
					
					
						See how they come as pilgrims
						Seeking an ancient shrine,
						Grasping your cup like bibbers
						Famished for favorite wine
						
						
						Merchant, fireman and newsboy;
						Motorman, darky and drone
						Draw on your cooling treasure
						As if each drop were his own.
						Some of your friends are palsied,
						Some of them blind and old,
						But each finds joy and vigor
						In your draught so clear and cold.
					
					
					
						Old Red Pump on the Corner!
						Of woes you have your share;
						They say you gather microbes
						And spread them everywhere.
						Of course we know grim Science
						Must view you with alarm
						And make you seem a menace
						Devoid of worth or charm.
						But we of humbler learning
						Find, when the day is hot,
						You may be germ-prolific,
						But, Pump, how you hit the spot!
					
				
				
				
					"WISH YOU WAS HERE"
					
						GOT a card from Steve this mornin',
						Dog-gone his trav'lin' skin,
						He's up around Niag'ry Falls
						A-writin' home ag'in.
						Seems like that boy's one glory
						Is wand'rin' fur an' free,
						An' furder off he gits, I gosh,
						Th' more he writes to me.
						He sends these pictur' postal cards,
						With photos showin' that
						Th' world is allus beautif'lest
						Where you ain't livin' at.
						His messages reads all th' same-
						In letters large an' clear
						He writes from Maine or Kankakee an'
						says-
						"Wish you was here"
					
					
					
					
					
						Nobody ever seems to know
						Just when he'll go er where;
						We git his destination
						From th' card that says he's there.
						An' he ain't more than settled down
						To loaf a day or two
						Till he gits thinkin' up th' names
						Of ever' one he knew.
						An' then with ever' dog-gone cent
						He possibly kin spare
						He buys th' Unitary church,
						Th' Depot an' th' Square.
						He buys 'bout ever'thing they is
						In Bath er Belvidere,
						Then mails th' whole blame business home
						an' says-
						"Wish you was here!"
					
					
					
						I guess he's at Niag'ry now-
						He was last time he wrote-
						But that don't prove conclusively
						He ain't in Terry Hote.
						He may be down in Panama
						Er snoopin' 'round in Nome,
						Nobody knows just where he's at-
						Except he ain't at home!
						I guess we'd never hear from him
						Fer months er mebbe years
						If some kind soul had not devised
						These pictur' souvenirs.
						Yes, I expect if Steve would die
						He'd rise up from his bier
						To pen a card to all his friends an' say-
						"Wish you was here!"
					
				
				
				
					THE HOUSE OF WHERE
					
						BESIDE the winding Friendswood road
						A house of weathered gray
						Stands tenantless as Eden's realm
						Since Adam moved away.
						The old house makes me Fancy's toy
						And thoughts, unguarded, play
						At wondering who abided there
						And where they are to-day.
						It is, in fact, a House of Where;
						Strange voices seem to say:
						"O where's the cheer of yesteryear?
						The children, where are they?"
					
					
						The gate, weed-throttled, silent stands,
						Its creak has lost its thrill.
						The fence has fallen in decay
						And tumbled down the hill.
						
						
						Its pickets bear no sunning crocks,
						The groaning pump is still,
						No voices echo from the barn
						"Gee-hawing" Bob and Bill.
						No mother voice sounds noontime's call
						To "Come and get your fill"
						There's naught but silence-everywhere!-
						Monotonous and chill.
						
						The trees, old comrades left behind,
						Cast forth a useless shade;
						They seem to wreathe in gloom the place
						Where once glad children played.
						Where are the little pilgrims now?
						Where have their footsteps strayed?
						Where has the mother of the brood
						New habitation made?
						No answer comes-but Heaven grant
						The changes they've essayed
						Have led them to still brighter paths,
						With spirit unafraid.
					
				
				
				
					HIS FIRST POCKETS
					
						I'M got pockets! Ist like man's-
						One for bofe of my two han's!
						One for pennies when I'm good
						Like my muvver says I should;
						One for cookies-yes, an' say,
						I had shoc'late drops to-day;
						Had 'em in my pockets where
						They ain't got no business there,
						'Cause they shoc'late up my pants
						If they git a half a chance.
						'Nen my muvver laugh and say
						What's they made for anyway?
						Ain't they made for boys to eat?-
						Li'l boys 'at's good an' sweet?
						'Specially th' kind 'at grows
						Up wif pockets in their clo'es!
						
						Daddy he's got pockets, too,
						Ist like all us mans's do,
						Still he says it's funny, though,
						Where his pennies all time go.
						'Nen my muvver she ist play
						Like she don't hear what he say;
						'Nen he says well he suppose
						Burg-u-lars been in his clo'es.
						'Nen I say I spec' they do
						An' he says he knows 'em, too,
						But he don't-'cause muvver she
						Says he puts 'em there for me.
						Muvver she-it don't seem fair-
						Ain't got pockets anywhere.
						But she says, gee, ain't it fine?-
						She kin keep her things in mine!
					
				
				
				
				
				
					WHEN "20" COMES INTO THE YARDS
					
						THE levers click up in the tower,
						The semaphore's arm changes, too;
						The yard shanty clock points the hour
						When old "Number 20" is due.
					
					
						From out of the west comes a rumble,
						The switch engines sneak from the main,
						Forsaking toil slavish and humble
						To clear for the limited train.
					
					
						It's "20" that's coming-old "20"-
						Proud bearer of men and of mail;
						The symbol of speed and of plenty,
						A queen of the caravan trail.
					
					
					
					
					
						The tower man out at the Crossing
						Stands fast by his levers and smiles
						As smoke clouds, with turbulent tossing,
						Go trailing old "20" for miles.
					
					
						He signals down into the city
						That "20" has passed on her way,
						Then whistles some lighthearted ditty-
						She's "by" without any delay!
					
					
						O'er subway, past shanty and siding,
						The wheels whirr in musical chime,
						As down through the yards she goes gliding
						And enters the station on time!
					
					
						Unmindful of joy or of sorrow
						Old "20" speeds east on her run,
						Then turns and-re-christened-to-morrow
						Comes westward as old "21."
					
				
				
				
					UP ALONG THE RIVER
					
						UP along the river!
						What a wealth of beauty lies
						In its rippling panorama
						Of the cloud-fantastic skies.
						Here a castle, there a city
						Mirrored up to boat and shore,
						Just to taunt my June-day fancies,
						Then to vanish evermore.
						Now a willow dips its laces
						In the warm, dream-hazy tide,
						As a dark tadpole flotilla
						Scurries off somewhere to hide.
						Then I hear a flap of canvas
						And the swish of waters rent
						By a craft, lone-manned, but freighted
						With a cargo of content.
						
						And I catch my own sea-envies
						Rising up to wish that I
						Were the skipper and the cargo
						Of that ship a-sailing by.
					
					
						Up along the river!
						What a joy it is to be
						Where the deepest gloom that haunts you
						Is the shadow of a tree;
						Where the greatest tide that thrills you
						Is a river flowing by
						And its ripples dancing tangoes
						With a cloud rift in the sky.
						Dear old Fancy!
						How you lure me into June-green paths
						to-day-
						Paths that lead along the river-
						Up the river far away!
						
						
						
						There are boats, too-and companions-
						In this panorama rare,
						And the only joy that's missing
						Is the joy of being there.
						For I-like legion others
						In the city's thrall to-day
						Can only dream I'm up there-
						Up the river far away!
					
				
				
				
					HOLLYHOCKS
					
						GAY HOLLYHOCKS, who gave you
						Such an unromantic name?
						One held among the humblest
						In the garden's hall of fame.
						Who fixed your floral status
						So that you must hide your face
						At kitchen doors, by backyard fence,
						Or other lonely place?
					
					
						You seem, somehow, a mystery,
						And yet your magic bloom
						Makes pageantry of poverty
						And gives a glow to gloom.
						You bring a beam to ashmen's eyes
						And all the alley clan
						Tiptoes to get a glimpse of you
						And your glad caravan.
					
					
					
						Why don't you march right out in front
						And let your blooms compete
						With all the summer's pampered pets,
						The garden's gay elite?
						Bid each hue-neutral passer-by
						To take an honest view,
						Then say which plant-aristocrat
						Has fairer tints than you.
					
					
						Parade your pink and yellow hues,
						Stand forth in white and red,
						Then show with what fine majesty
						You lift your queenly head.
						Sway back and forth across the breeze
						Where rose and dahlia reign,
						Till newborn envy shall supplant
						Their previous disdain.
					
					
						And yet you seem divinely sent
						To blossom where you do-
						
						
						Where men of humble walk must pass
						And need such joys as you.
						So, Hollyhocks, reign on, reign on
						By backyard fence and door
						That smiles may glowingly abide
						Where shadows dwelt before.

						Fo' ma dandelion greens!
						Um-m-m! Um-m-m! Pass 'em to me!
					
				
				
				
					THE OLD GREEN SASH
					
						FETCH me ould green sash, Ann Dugan,
						Place it with me Sunday clo'es,
						There besoide me sprig av shamrock
						Sent from where th' shamrock grows.
					
					
						Press th' wrinkles from me sash, Ann,
						Make it so's th' folds will lay
						Close upon th' breast thot loves it,
						Wears, it, too, S'int Pathrick's day.
					
					
						I'm t' roide a horse, mavourneen,
						Up where all th' world can see
						How me heart still clings to Erin,
						Land av our nativity.
					
					
						Oh, ye'll be thot proud, Ann Dugan,
						Whin ye see me prancin' by,
						
						Thot within yer heart ye'll whisper:
						"There's me Oirish proide an' j'y!"
					
					
						Shure, ye'll see th' Sheas and Sharkeys,
						Wid thim Kelly fri'nds av moine,
						Passin' word along th' curbstone:
						"There comes Dugan! Ain't he foine?'
					
					
						How yer dear ould heart will flutter
						Till th' tears and laughter clash,
						Then ye'll hear yer own self sayin':
						"Shure 'twas me thot tied th' sash!"
					
					
						Though th' years roll on, Ann Dugan,
						An' me hair grows deeper gray,
						Still thot dear ould sash I'll cherish
						Till me lasht S'int Pathrick's day!
					
				
				
				
					FETCHING HOME THE COWS
					
						FRIEND, I know you'll misconstrue me
						An' will chuckle when I say
						That I've seen a livin' picture
						Of my boyhood's years to-day.
						Yes, sir; seen it like 'twas human
						An' it made th' blood in me
						Rise half-skeered an' half-delighted
						At its strange reality.
						Tell you how it was-now, listen!
						Through some impulse undefined
						I walked countryward this twilight
						Seekin' calm an' peace of mind.
						Well, 'twas while I paused a moment
						Near the foot of Five-mile Bridge
						That a herd of cows come browsin'
						'Long a bypath down th' ridge.
						
						Now, that ain't no strange adventure,
						But 'twas queer you will agree,
						That among th' livin' cattle
						Walked two cows in phantomry!
						Yes, sir; spirit cows, I'm sayin',
						Walked among th' livin' herd,
						An' it got me so bewildered
						That I couldn't speak a word.
						Comin'-they just kep' a-comin'-
						Till th' mist that dimmed my eye
						Made me see old Red an' Molly-
						Cows Dad owned in days gone by
						There they were, Red's bell a-tinklin',
						Where they always used to browse;
						An' I heard my mother callin':
						"Sonny, go an' fetch th' cows!"
					
					
						All at once th' world grew newer!
						It was not a world of men;
						
						
						
						It was boyhood, all obedient,
						Fetchin' home th' cows again.
						Joyously I followed after,
						Tossin' pebbles down the lane,
						Urgin' Red an' Molly homeward,
						For th' day was on th' wane.
						But my march abruptly ended
						When a man's voice made me rouse,
						Comin' from th' hills behind me:
						"Where ye goin' with my cows?"
						"Back to boyhood!" I informed him,
						An' I think he understood,
						For he answered, kind an' friendly:
						"Dear old man, I wish you could!"
					
				
				
				
					SCHOOL'S OUT AT SHORTRIDGE
					
						SING if you will of the debutantes
						And toast all the queens that rule,
						But give me the girls-the Shortridge
						girls-
						On the homeward way from school.
					
					
						On the schoolward way their steps may halt
						And their eyes shed doubtful light,
						As they face the pall of Learning's call
						And of books untouched last night.
					
					
						For Youth in blossom is Youth aglow
						And none of us dares deny
						That the schoolward way was a dull, deep
						gray
						In the good old days gone by.
					
					
					
						But after school! Then Youth sings songs
						As it goes its care-free way,
						And 'twas thus that I at old Shortridge High
						Saw the girls go by to-day.
					
					
						Their steps were light, their hearts were
						light,
						Not a book-cloud marred the sky;
						The school-day done, they were out for fun
						And they had it-so did I.
					
					
						My heart grew glad as I saw them pass
						In caravan gay and sweet,
						While echoes of "He" and "Him" and "We"
						Were wafted along the street.
					
					
						Ah, what is sweeter than Youth's first dreams
						Of Loves that never may be
						Or yields more smiles in the afterwhiles
						Of a School-day Memory?
					
					
					
					
					
						So here's to the Girls of Shortridge High,
						May Life flood their souls with joy,
						And could I decree new fate for me-
						Well, I'd be a Shortridge Boy!
					
				
				
				
					THE LAMENT OF THE LONESOME GRAY
					
						AN old gray nag, with a droop and drag,
						Drew up at the curb to-day,
						And, as horses talk as well as balk,
						We heard the old steed say:
					
					
						"Where are the friends, the good old friends
						I knew in the days gone by?
						The Bills and Petes of the city streets
						Are gone-but here am I.
					
					
						"The motor rage of this speed-mad age
						Has driven them all away,
						Till now I'm classed with the hazy Past
						And known as The Lonesome Gray.
					
					
					
						"I gaze to right and my only sight
						Is motors of divers style;
						I look to left and my soul's bereft
						Of even an old pal's smile.
					
					
						"And now I hear-with loss of cheer-
						They're to have a Motor Show
						Like the horses had in the golden, glad
						Old days of the long ago.
					
					
						"They'll shine and rub each spoke and hub,
						They'll make the bodies shed
						A lustrous sheen like that I've seen
						Put on the thoroughbred.
					
					
						"They'll talk of pumps, of springs and
						bumps,
						They'll gossip of tools and tires,
						But never a word will there be heard
						Of love for a line of sires.
					
					
					
					
						"Well, I suppose wise Progress knows
						The needs of the world to-day.
						But my old eyes blur when men prefer
						Honk-honk to a friendly neigh!"
					
				
				
				
					"GIT EP!"
					
						DEY is folks dat's allus whinin'
						'Bout de burdens dey mus' b'ah,
						'Bout de sun ain' nevah shinin'
						An' it's rainin' ev'rywhah.
						An' dey nevah do no hopin'

						But sneak to bed a-mopin'
						An' git up all blue an' glum.
						Now, dey ain' no use o' talkin',
						Dat won't he'p de soul along,
						So, instid o' standin' balkin',
						Perk right up an' sing dis song:

					THE CIRCUS WAGON'S RUMBLE
					
						FOLKS, I know you're goin' to chuckle
						An' embarrass me like sin
						With your jov'al accusations
						That I'm turnin' boy ag'in,
						When I make th' simple statement,
						Purged of guile an' fancy free,
						That a circus wagon's rumble
						Ain't unmusical to me.
						Them's th' facts! I say it honest
						An' could prove my the'ries true
						If you only had th' courage
						Of a young 'un's point of view.
						Just fergit now, fer a moment,
						All your self-devised conceit
						An' play like there's a circus show
						A-comin' down th' street.
						
						
						
						Here she comes! There's no denyin'
						It's a picture mighty grand,
						With its clowns an' golden cages
						An' its heralders an' band.
						Now just set your ears fer listenin',
						Both a-hark'nin' to'rd th' ground,
						So's they'll ketch th' rhythmic rumble
						Of th' wheels a-goin' 'round.
						Why, it makes my body tingle
						From my head down to my heels
						When I hear th' rumblin' mumblin'
						Of a circus wagon's wheels.
						No, I wouldn't say 'twas music,
						Like a harp or choral glee,
						But I do insist, by doggies,
						That it's mighty sweet to me!
					
					
						I just go around a-listenin'
						From th' time it comes to town
						
						Till th' big menag'rie's loaded
						An' th' tents are comin' down.
						Every wheel I hear a-turnin'
						Brings my boyhood back to me,
						When I went to bed at sunset
						An' got up at half pas' three.
						I can tell each wagon's rumble-
						Ticket, canvas, cage or pole-
						An' I learnt my first real cussin'
						From a driver in a hole.
						So, you see I'm schooled in circus,
						An' no rumbles ever heard
						Are as sweetly hypnotistic-
						If there is that kind of word.
					
				
				
				
					THE STORY OF THE GAME
					
						SAY, Mister Sportin' Editor,
						Please give us kids de space
						To tell about de winnin'
						Of de Stringtown pennant race.
						Ye see, 'twuz like dis, Mister,
						Us Little White Sox guys
						We played de Blake Street Busters
						Four games an' two wuz ties,
						Well, dey dis kep' a-claimin'
						Dey's champeens, don't ye see?
						Dis 'cause deir game stood ten to eight
						An' ours wuz four to three.
						So we got tired o' listenin'
						To all deir champeen stuff
						An' challenged 'em to play de rub-
						An' 'course dey called de bluff.
						
						
						
						Who christianed us de White Sox?
						Well, dat's our name all right,
						Fer when our team is goin' t' play
						We wash our ankles white.
						Well, after poppin' off a while
						De Busters dey come 'round.
						An' said dey'd play us Saturday
						Down on de circus ground.
						Us captains tossed a bat to see
						Which side took in er out
						An' dat's de way de game begun
						I'm tellin' ye about.
						Well, t'ings went nip an' tuck a while
						Until de Busters dey
						Got to our pitcher an' we t'ought
						De stuff wuz off, but say,
						De ninth come 'round, de score
						It stood ag'in' us-six to three-
						
						Two Sox wuz out-de bases full!-
						An' it wuz up to me!
						Two strikes! T'ree balls!
						De dippy umps wuz stingin' me fer fair-
						De next ball up wuz in de groove!
						Say, guy, I hit it square!
						It bee-lined t'roo de pitcher's box
						Wid never slackin' pace
						Till-bing! It stuck inside a can
						We used fer second base!
						Us four White Sox went racin' 'round-
						I made de winnin' run
						Before dey got dat baseball out!
						Dat's how de game wuz won!
						De Busters touched us wid de can,
						But umps says, wid a grin:
						"Ye got t' touch 'em wid de ball
						An' not a piece o' tin!"
					
				
				
				
					THE URCHIN AND THE LILY
					
						"HANDS off the flowers," the park sign said.
						The Urchin-what cared he?-
						When lilies, from their marshy bed,
						Peered forth so temptingly.
					
					
						"W'at's flo'rs fer?" we heard him say,
						"If dey ain't fer t' pick,
						Uspecially w'en 'cross de way
						Dey's some one awful sick!"
					
					
						And ere the park policeman's shout
						Could halt his hand or feet,
						He'd plucked a lily, wheeled about,
						And hurried for the street.
					
					
						The water from the petals dripped
						And marked his speeding path,
						
						
						
						Till through a cottage door he tripped
						Beyond avenging wrath.
					
					
						There, on a bed of snowy white,
						The lily bud he threw.
						"Gee, looky, sweetheart!" cried the mite.
						"Look w'at I brung to you!"
					
					
						His mother's pale hands clasped his own
						And tear-drops that he saw
						Made him to lisp, in tender tone:
						"Ain't you my sweetheart, Ma?"
					
				
				
				
					LONGINGS AND LIMITATIONS
					
						DON'T think that I'm complainin', folks,
						'Bout bein' borned a girl,
						'Cause I'm as glad as I can be
						I'm not a dog er squir'l.
						But, seems to me, boys allus gits
						Th' best of ever'thing,
						Uspecially when circus shows
						Starts comin' in th' Spring.
						Fer then they git to go an' watch
						Th' circus train unload,
						An' see th' elephants an' all
						A-comin' down th' road.
						But girls-they've got to stay at home,
						No matter how they frown,
						An' act like growed-up wimmens when
						Th' circus comes to town.
						
						Boys gits up mornin's four o'clock-
						My brother does, an' he
						Wakes up th' boy next door, but they
						Don't never wake up me.
						They never wait fer breakfast time,
						Like girls would have to do;
						Dis all they want is crackers, er
						A cold fried egg er two.
						Then off they go an' don't come back
						Till supper time, an' then
						Go sneakin' through th' backyard gate
						An' see th' show again.
						But girls they've got to stay at home
						An' pout an' sit aroun',
						An' hate it 'cause they're wimmen when
						Th' circus comes to town.
					
					
						I bet you when I git growed up,
						An' have things my own way,
						
						
						
						I'll go out to th' circus grounds
						An' stay there all th' day.
						No one can make me stick at home
						All dollared up an' sweet,
						An' I'll have all th' lemonade
						An' peanuts I can eat.
						I'll tell you what girls ought to do,
						To not be left alone-
						That's buy theirselves a circus show
						An' have it all their own.
						Er else all go an' marry to
						Some ackerbat er clown
						An' live right with the circus when
						Th' circus comes to town.
					
				
				
				
					THE VOCALIZING VULCANS
					
						'LONG 'bout four doors down Georgy Street,
						Just off o' Illinoy,
						Bill Powell keeps a blacksmith shop-
						Bill Powell an' his boy.
						Th' shop's just like ten thousand more,
						Except in one degree-
						It's got some sentiments on toil
						That's mighty sweet to me.
						Now' days th' order is to work
						From dawn till set of sun,
						But down to Bill's they do their work-
						Then sing when they git done!
					
					
						Bill's men is all musicianers-
						Such good ones, I'll remark,
						
						That when their organ starts to play
						I'll hang around till dark.
						An' it's a reg'lar organ, too,
						An Estey worn an' old,
						But still possessed of tones like them
						Th' forest choirs unfold.
						I reckon 'twas a treasure
						In some parlor long ago,
						For Bill's boy bought it second-hand--
						Or third-hand-he dunno.
					
					
						It sits around behind th' forge
						An', I confess, it's odd
						To see an organ in th' midst
						Of horses gittin' shod.
						Yet, there it is, an' oftentimes
						You'll hear th' anvil's ring
						A-keepin' time with melodies
						Th' smiths and teamsters sing.
						
						
						
						But most times it's at close of day
						When all th' work is through
						That Bill's men an' th' organ
						Harmonize a hymn or two.
					
					
						Th' firelight in th' forge burns low-
						Yet high enough so's they
						Can see th' hymn book an' th' notes
						That Bill's boy has to play.
						The' traffic out in Georgy Street
						Slows down an' halts to hear
						Old "Rock of Ages" ringin' out
						In cadence sweet an' clear.
						An' there I sit a-thankin' God
						That, of th' city's throng,
						There's some who find life sweet enough
						To blend its toil with song.
					
				
				
				
					THE MUDDLED MODES
					
						YES, Time has devised many changes, my brother,
						I'm not the beau-bravo you once used to know.
						Perhaps I've slowed up, Bud, but somehow or other
						I don't make the breeze that I did years ago.
						I now stand around like some preacher on pension,
						And, Bud, you may grasp what my platitudes mean
						When I but remark that I'm under great tension
						Since Sister looks forty and Mother-sixteen!
					
					
						You don't live at home, Bud; you miss the confusion
						
						That comes of the styles as they're wearing them now.
						My days are all spent in a maze of illusion-
						I can't tell our Mother from Sister somehow!
						Oft times as I gaze down the walks of the garden
						I see a trim figure with grace of a queen;
						It looks like our Sister but-I must beg pardon-
						It's tunic-gowned Mother-not forty!-sixteen!
					
					
						And Sister-dear Sister-that idolized creature,
						With stately composure she sweeps thro' the hall,
						The girlishness banished from coiffure and feature---
						
						
						
						You'd think her teens vanished forever and all!
						She trips off with Mother to tea or cotillion;
						They maxixe and tango in chumship serene,
						And no man would dare-not one man in a million--
						To say which was forty and which was-sixteen!
					
					
						I see them down-town in the bargaining Meccas,
						My heart beats with pride as they Argentine by;
						Oh, yes, they walk dance steps-the Eves and Rebekahs
						Now move with new grace that is youthful and spry.
						And, brother, I like it-with all my inertness-
						
						The man who disdains it is sordid and mean.
						For, though they confuse me, I like their alertness--
						Ma rivals at forty our Sis at sixteen!
					
				
				
				
					MOTHER'S DAY
					
						SO at last we've got to Mother,
						By our deviatin' ways,
						With a thought to plant some gladness
						In th' garden of her days.
						We have bowed to men- immortals
						An' have made a lot of stir
						'Bout th' glory of th' nation-
						But we've been neglectin' her!
						An', th' fact is, she ain't askin'
						Fer no emphasized degree
						Of th' thing men call distinction-
						Lawsy, no!-old Mother she
						Asks fer nothin' more heroic
						Than th' feelin', warm an' snug,
						Of a Mother's Day remembrance
						In a lovin' little hug.
					
					
					
					
					
						Mother's Day! I like th' meter
						Of its sweet an' rhythmic ring,
						Fer it breathes of early Maytime
						An' th' very soul of Spring.
						Then it is my thoughts of Mother
						Kind o' run to happy hours
						Back behind th' old home kitchen,
						Watchin' her a-plantin' flowers.
						An' I draw sweet mem'ry pictures
						Of my childhood long ago
						When her step was more elastic
						An' her brow had less of snow.
						An' to-day my soul's a-pinin'
						An' my heartstrings feel a tug
						That is nothin' more than hunger
						Fer a lovin' little hug.
					
					
						Folks, they tell me that th' doctrine
						Of our havin' Mother's Day
						
						Is to kind o' ease her burdens
						In a lovin' sort of way;
						Just to send her to th' parlor,
						In her newest Sunday gown,
						With a sweet command, but final:
						"Mother, now you go sit down."
						Pile her high with glad devotions,
						Match her smile with words of praise,
						Till you ketch yourself a-wishin'
						All her life was Mother's Days.
						Draw her closely, fondly to you
						An' you'll feel her old heart chug
						As her tears of gladness thank you
						Fer a lovin' little hug.
					
				
				
				
					HOWDY, MISTAH PUNKIN!

						Good mawnin'! Howdy-do!

					 A CREEKSIDE COMEDY
					
						SOMETIMES I like th' Winter best,
						Then sometimes Spring an' Fall,
						But mostly me an' Pizen thinks
						Ole Summer beats them all!
					
					
						We call him Pizen 'cause, you see,
						He gits his feet all sore
						From pizen vines-an' then he can't
						Go barefoot any more.
						Ole Pize an' me has lots of jokes
						In summer-time when we
						Go swimmin' in th' swimmin' hole
						Down by the willer tree.
					
					
						We start a-takin' off our clo'es
						Before we're nearly there
						An' then I holler: "Last one in
						His dad's a grizzly bear!"
					
					
					
						An' 'course, his daddy's allus it,
						'Cause Pizen can't begin
						To git his shoes an' stockin's off
						Before I'm divin' in.
					
					
						Then Pizen he gits even when
						He takes th' clo'es I've got,
						An' soon's I'm divin' in th' crick,
						He ties 'em in a knot.
					
					
						An' when we're done a-swimmin' he
						Goes 'hind some tree to hide
						An' yells "Chaw beef!" when I have got
						To chew my clo'es untied.
					
					
						Then soon as we are both dressed up
						We stand around an' grin
						Till both, without a single word,
						Strips off-an' goes back in!
					
				
				
				
				
				
					SANTA CLAUS DAYS
					
						O SANTA CLAUS days! What a mystical maze
						You weave all about us to last all our days!
						With skeins of sweet legend of fanciful hue
						Our hearts are forever held captive by you.
						The years may divide the gray present from youth
						And garrulous tongues shatter Fancy with Truth,
						Still, deep in our breasts, beam the undying rays
						Of heart-holy love for old Santa Claus days!
					
					
						My Santa Claus days! Yes, the ones that I knew;
						I am longing to-night for communion with you.
						
						Come back down the chimney, O Season of Joy!
						And set me to dreaming the dreams of a boy.
						Hang up by the fireplace, on bedpost and chair
						The same baby stockings that used to be there.
						Hang o'er them the wishes, the hopes, of a child
						And let my old heart be a boy's running wild!
					
					
						Glad Santa Claus days! As I muse o'er you now,
						Fond memories, green as the mistletoe bough,
						Come trooping before me to laugh and unfold
						Each joy that was mine in the boy days of old.
						I greet with glad glances the holly, the tree,
						
						And a Romping Old Tourist, whose riotous glee
						Subsides to a smile as he pauses to beam
						On a drowsy old man at his Christmas Eve dream.
					
					
						Gray Santa Claus days! Though the journey is far
						From Used-to-be days to the dream days that are,
						My faith has not wavered, O Saint of the Sleigh!
						As I loved you in childhood I love you today.
						The cynics may scoff and Truth call me a foe,
						But the same old Saint Nick that I knew long ago
						Shall live in my soul till I come to the day
						When even my dreams fade and vanish away!
					
				
				
				
					THANKSGIVIN' PUNKIN PIE
					
						O, TH' luck there is in livin'
						'Long about good old Thanksgivin'
						When th' crops for which you've striven
						Are all safely gathered by.
						When th' autumn's harvest story
						Is of summer's golden glory,
						Then you're feelin' hunky-dory
						An' you're wantin' punkin pie!
						P- U- Unkin-
						Punkin pie!
					
					
						Then there oozes from th' kitchen
						Soothin' odors so bewitchin'
						That they set your nostrils itchin'
						An' put twinkles in your eye.
						
						An' you know th' thing tormentin'
						That you ketch yourself a-scentin'
						Is a joy your wife's inventin'-
						Real Thanksgivin' punkin pie.
						P- U- Unkin-
						Punkin pie!
					
					
						You don't want to wait a minute
						For a chance to go ag'in' it-
						Want to git your face down in it
						Till it chokes you purty nigh.
						Feel like you could finish seven,
						Tackle nine an' mebbe 'leven-
						But just ONE would be a heaven
						If it's reg'lar Hoosier pie!
						P- U- Unkin-
						Punkin pie!
					
				
				
				
					THE WONDERFUL LAND OF SEE
					
						THERE'S a wonderful land that babies explore;
						We will call it the Land of See;
						It runs from the hall to the old kitchen door,
						Then back to a fond mother's knee.
						And sometimes their world is a big windowseat,
						Or under the green bay tree-
						Wherever it is, you will hear them repeat
						Their mystical joy-word: "See?"
					
					
						And what do they see? Well, nobody knows;
						To them things are all that they seem.
						The wall-paper's flower quite suddenly grows,
						There's snow in the teakettle's steam.
						
						The mirror is peopled with real little girls
						And not just with faces that beam;
						The bed is an ocean that tumbles and whirls
						And makes the "See?" mariners scream!
					
					
						They "See?" and point fingers at mythical things
						That grown-ups know never could be;
						Yet each pointed finger some memory brings
						Quite clearly to you and to me.
						For one time, we, too, on Fancy's gay wings
						Made flights 'round a dear mother's knee,
						But Time came along and severed the strings,
						Then stole our fair Land of See.
					
					
					
				
				
				
					LITTLE LADY 'PRINKLECAN
					
						LITTLE Lady 'Prinklecan,
						'At's what our next neighbor man
						All time calls me when I go
						'Prinklin' where our flowers grow.
						Ever' day an' ever' day
						'At's what our next neighbor say.
					
					
						I ist like to get up soon
						'Fore it's nearly afternoon,
						'Nen go find my 'prinklecan
						An' ist make our neighbor man
						Laugh an' laugh till he can't see
						Laughin' by hisself at me.
					
					
						Seem like flowers don't know when
						They must drink some water, 'nen
						
						
						
						I ist got to go an' look
						If their water's all been took.
						'Nen I got to 'prinkle-see?-
						Till he comes an' laughs at me.
					
					
						I ist play like I don't care
						If he's standin' laughin' there.
						Too, he jokes me 'bout my hat
						An' my feets an' things like that.
						'Nen we both laugh-'cause, you see,
						I ist all time 'prinkle me!
					
				
				
				
					 WHEN YOU'VE BEEN AWAY A WHILE
					
						OFTTIMES, in life's endeavor,
						You grow weary of the way
						Your feet, the slaves of custom,
						Tread the same old paths each day.
						You tire of things and faces
						And, well, somehow, can not down
						A deep, insatiate longing
						Just to get away from town.
						You'd leave to-day's environs
						Far behind you, mile on mile,
						And, to-morrow, would be happy,
						When you'd got away a while.
					
					
						The way might lead to cities,
						Or where land and oceans meet,
						
						Though, sometimes, Nature's solitudes
						Make freedom doubly sweet.
						But days will come, O Wanderer,
						I care not where you roam,
						When magnets wrought of hearth-love
						Will turn your feet toward home.
						You'll find, too, that you're hungry
						For an honest, friendly smile;
						They seem so worth the having-
						When you've been away a while.
					
					
						The homebound train moves slowly,
						Though the time card says it's fast;
						The homebound heart's impatient,
						But all trains get there at last.
						With nose against the window
						You will peer out in the night
						To have your vision gladdened
						By the first electric light.
						
						
						
						And if you've come in daytime
						You will hurry down the aisle
						Half-shouting: "It's the old town!
						I've been gone an awful while!"
					
				
				
				
					THE MOP MARYS
					
						DOWN in the Yard, with its dust and din,
						Its "Limiteds" out and "Fast Mails" in,
						There toil two women of sturdy frame,
						Unsung in ballad nor known to fame,
						And yet, in life, with its sordid trend,
						They serve a worthy and useful end.
						Mop Marys, they call them, which name regards
						The work they do in the Pullman yards.
					
					
						We stand and view, with wondering eye,
						The great steel caravan rushing by,
						Yet never a thought commends the arms
						That gave the train its burnished charms.
						We ponder not on the hours of toil,
						The battles with dust and grime and oil;
						
						
						
						Of backs that bend and of aching knees
						That spell train elegance, comfort, ease!
					
					
						From dawn of day till the twilight hour
						They mop and dust and scrub and scour,
						Though Life's grim irony
						plays them mean-
						They travel not in the cars they clean.
						Still, back of it all, their hearts aspire
						For something more than their humble hire.
						'Tis an inner joy they can't explain,
						Born when you say:
						"What a splendid train!"
					
				
				
				
					THE OLD HIGH CHAIR
					
						AT the door of a shop
						In quaint Second-hand Square
						Stands a battered, discarded,
						Old-fashioned high chair.
						Its legs have grown wabbly,
						Its back is infirm,
						The arms show the stress
						Of each juvenile squirm.
						Its foot-rest is rounded by shuffling of feet,
						The paint has long vanished
						From arms, back and seat.
						Each passer-by knows, by its vagabond tone,
						That more than one baby
						Has ruled from its throne.
					
					
						Each worn arm exhibits
						A spoon's crescent dent
						
						
						
						By some little tartar with anger to vent.
						And if you look closely
						No doubt you'll see, too,
						The imprints of teeth
						That were just coming through.
						One almost can picture,
						Through Fancy's design.
						The days when 'twas your chair--
						Or maybe 'twas mine!
						Ah, well, it was some one's
						This rattlebox throne
						That stands on the sidewalk-
						Deserted!-alone!
					
					
						But where are the babies?
						The world wonders where
						Are all of the toddlers
						Who've clung to this chair?
						Have they become grown-ups
						And passed from the maze
						
						Of Lullabyland and its baby chair days?
						God grant 'twas not Want,
						Every mother-heart's dread,
						That caused one to barter
						This treasure for bread.
						And if He of Heaven made vacant her chair
						No doubt one as comfy
						Was waiting Up There!
					
				
				
				
					GOOD OLD MISTER BOBSLED
					
						GOOD old Mister Bobsled
						Friend of long ago,
						How I long to see, you, Bob,
						Soon as they's a snow.
					
					
						Sort of git to feelin'
						How 'twould do me good
						Just to go to town ag'in
						On a bob o' wood.
					
					
						Daddy up a-drivin',
						Me an' ma an' Milt
						Sittin' there behind him
						Snugged up in a quilt.
					
					
						Comforters a-plenty,
						Irons to warm our feet,
						Yes, an' sticks o' hick'ry wood
						Servin' fer a seat.
					
					
					
						Hear th' snow a-creakin'
						As we'd scoot along,
						Something' kind o' angel-like
						In th' runners' song.
					
					
						Nick an' Nell a-trottin'
						Down old Heston road,
						Nary thought about their sins
						Er their heavy load.
					
					
						Good old Mister Bobsled,
						Though ye're out o' style,
						Still ye've got them fancy sleds
						Beat a thousan' mile.
					
					
						'Least that's my opinion,
						An' I'd ort to know--
						'Cause me an' you was kinfolks
						Forty years ago.
					
				
				
				
					THE HANDICAP OF RICHES
					
						HERE, looky, Jimmy! Looky here!
						Dat's w'at I meant, ye see,
						A-blowin' how de rich guy's kids
						Ain't got no edge on me.
					
					
						It's named a radiator, Jim,
						A fancy heatin' scheme;
						A 'ristocrat's base burnerer
						'Cept it's he't up by steam.
					
					
						Now, w'at's got me a-guessin', kid,
						Is how old Sant' will do
						W'en he bumps up ag'in' a shack
						Wit' pipes instead o' flue.
					
					
						Naw, swells ain't got no chimblys, pal,
						Fer dat's not style, ye see,
						
						An' how dem poor rich kids'll git
						Deir gifts is puzzlin' me.
					
					
						Dis s'pose ole Sant' did go thoo pipes
						'Bout all dat he could take
						Would be a string o' wieniewursts
						Er artificial snake.
					
					
						Jim, dat ain't square w'en guys like us
						Got chimblys in our house
						W'at lets de ole saint scramble down
						As quiet as a mouse.
					
					
						Still, I ixpect he'll find a way
						To reach de rich kids, too,
						An' I ain't hopin' dat he won't;
						I ain't dat mean-are you?
					
				
				
				
					AN EARLY AUTUMN LULLABY
					
						SUMMAH'S gone a-glimmahin'
						An' de Fall-time's in de breeze;
						Hush, ma little 'possum-lubbin' babe!
						De 'simmons am a-waitin' fo' de fros'
						To hit de trees;
						Hush, ma little 'possum-lubbin' babe!
						De 'possum am a-skimmin' out to fin'
						A place to hide,
						De bobolink's gone southwahd
						To wintah wif his bride,

						An' yo' mammy's satisfied-
						So, hush, ma little 'possum-lubbin' babe!

					THE PLUGGER
					
						HEY call him just simply The Plugger,
						An old horse, worn, clumsy and gray,
						He drags an old wagon marked "Transfer"
						From dawn till the close of the day.
					
					
						He hasn't a charm you would speak of,
						His hair has the thickness of wool;
						Just one thing they say of The Plugger-
						He's there on the long, steady pull!
					
					
						The high-headed colts leave him trailing
						And give him the dust of the road,
						But when they are drooping and weary
						Old Plugger goes by with his load.
					
					
					
						So take your life's lesson from Plugger,
						Of logic his story is full;
						Don't spend all your strength in the morning--
						The evening load's hardest to pull!
					
				
				
				
					 AUTUMN ON THE TOWPATH
					
						THE sun, athwart the willow's
						Latticed limbs,
						Jewels the water, tints the leaves ashore;
						The wind, sweet singer
						Of a thousand hymns,
						Low chants the lyrics of a thousand more.
					
					
						A haze, November's garb of filmy gray,
						Hangs spectre-like,
						Above yon Fairview hill.
						Now, but for waters rippling on their way,
						My world this morning is a world a-still.
					
					
						The sycamores, white-bodied giants born
						To save the forests from a Stygian fate,
						
						
						
						Seem somber now-
						Grim woodland kings forlorn
						Beside the dogwood's brilliant robes of state.
					
					
						The path is strewn
						With leaves of countless hues,
						Countless indeed as are the years that span
						The distant time since first
						The frosts and dews
						Made Autumn's pageant glorious to man.
					
					
						The silence breaks!
						Adown the towpath's way
						Children pursue
						Youth's fabled Forty Thieves!
						Behind the trees
						They seek their fancied prey
						And search for footprints
						In the fallen leaves.
					
					
					
						Ah, children dear, 'tis you,
						Not I, that's thief.
						Though thief you call me
						In your childish play;
						You robbed me of a daydream--
						Sweet, but brief-
						And lured my Autumn reverie away!
					
				
				
				
					 IN THE BACK-LOT LEAGUE
					
						THINGS are doing on the Common,
						Down the alley, up the street;
						There's a Tyrus Cobb expression
						Worn by every kid you meet.
						There is talk of "rotten empires,"
						Talk of games both lost and won,
						All proclaiming that the season
						In the Back-Lot League's begun!
					
					
						Mother's ball of twine is missing,
						Store string saved since early fall,
						But she knows it now is serving
						As her Back-Lot Leaguer's ball.
						In the yard she finds old broom ends,
						Mop ends, hoes and things like that,
						Proof to her that once good handles
						Rival now the store-bought bat.
					
					
					
					
					
						In the evening on the corner,
						Where the arc light casts its rays,
						Future diamond kings sit "fanning,"
						Talking over scores and plays.
						Just one problem proves perplexing,
						One that makes the pitcher pout:
						"Why-dis 'cause his Dad's a copper-
						Dassen't no one strike Red out?"
					
				
				
				
					THAT FELLOW
					
						THAT fellow who has power
						Abounding in his heart
						With which to stop your sighing
						And give the smiles a start;
						That fellow who says "Howdy,"
						When "Howdy's" what you need
						To slow you down and make you
						Forget the Grind of Greed;
						That fellow has within him
						A soul that I contend
						Comes mighty near to being
						The synonym of friend.
					
					
						That fellow, you may notice,
						Will pause to pat a nag,
						Or bind a dog's abrasions
						With handkerchief or rag.
						
						You'll see him lead a blind man
						Across the crowded street,
						Then slip some wreck a nickel
						And help him to his feet.
						You'll hear he smokes and cusses,
						Drinks sometimes, too, they'll say,
						And yet he's always bright'ning
						Some other fellow's way.
					
					
						That fellow--well, his culture
						May not be up to form,
						But in his calloused handclasp
						There's something good and warm.
						He seems, somehow, to blossom
						Where weeds of sorrow grow,
						Though mighty little Bible
						He'd ever boast to know.
						And if the watchful angels,
						Who bless that heart of his,
						Were asked: "Is he a Christian?"
						I'm sure they'd say: "He is!"
					
					
					
				
				
				
					THE OLD TRACK GANG
					
						'TWAS just an ould photograph,
						Faded an' yellow,
						Long treasured in somebody's Album,
						Oi know,
						But from it came mimories,
						Sacred an' mellow,
						Thot gave me back fr'inds
						Av a glad long ago.
					
					
						It brought to me moind
						Th' ould thrack gang, begorra,
						Thim b'ys as well knew
						How a rail should be laid;
						Thim lads as could work
						All to-noight an' to-morrow,
						Thin spit on their hands
						An' go livel a grade.
					
					
					
						Though humble an' poor,
						They were min, let me tell ye,
						Wid gintlemen's proide
						In their sinew an' bone;
						Their hearts were as babes
						If a sorrow befell ye,
						But pity they'd none
						For a blackgyard or drone.
					
					
						Down there on th' thrack
						Wid their shovels an' gauges,
						Their picks an' their crowbars
						Av hefty desoign,
						Ye heard not a word
						About History's pages,
						But: "Squint at that rail, lads,
						An' git it in loine."
					
					
						Shure they had no derricks
						Or fancy invintions
						
						For liftin' the rails
						From th' top av th' car;
						They used Oirish muscle
						Av Trojan diminsions
						An' tumbled thim off
						Wid th' aid av a bar.
					
					
						They tamped ties an' laughed
						Av their own youthful glory
						Whin they wint a-sparkin'
						On Erin's ould sod;
						They paused now an' thin
						For th' joke av a shtory
						An' pitied poor divils
						Thot carried th' hod.
					
					
						At noon, whin th' boss
						Sounded truce for an hour,
						Their dinnerpails filled
						Iv'ry innermost nade;
						
						
						Thin, p'aceful an' calm
						As a midsummer shower,
						They smoked their dudeens
						In th' cool av th' shade.
					
					
						But thim was th' ould days-
						Days sacred an' mellow-
						Whin thrack-layin' shkill
						Was a virtue, begob,
						
						So take off yer hat to ould ganius,
						Young fellow-
						Thim b'ys could build railroad-
						An' loaf on th' job!
					
				
				
				
					 THE WATER CURE
					
						EVERY human bein' livin',
						I suppose, some time or other
						Feels a kind of vagrant impulse
						To go seekin' pastures new;
						You grow tired of work an' worry,
						Long for other scenes an' faces
						'Way off where th' world is gayer
						An' th' skies a brighter blue.
						But I've cured myself of havin'
						All those wild, unsettled longin's
						An' th' antidote is simple-
						Simple, sweet an' free from pain.
						I just light my pipe an' wander
						Down along th' quiet river,
						Climb a stump an' voice my gladness
						In this made-by-me refrain:
						
						I would rather be a ripple
						On an Indiana river
						Than a cloudburst in Sahara
						Where they celebrate a rain!
					
					
						There I sit an' watch th' water
						As it rambles to'rd th' ocean,
						Kind o' holdin' back an' wishin'
						That it didn't have to go,
						While th' ripples seem to anchor
						'Long th' shore among th' grasses,
						Glad to be in Indiana
						An' to cease their restless flow.
						An' I let my fancies figure
						That th' shore-bound ripples really
						Come to port to seek contentment
						An' escape Th' Ragin' Main.
						Then I just grow glad all over
						That I'm Hoosier-born an' happy
						
						
						
						An' have got a home to go to
						Where my heart can chant this strain:
						I would rather be a ripple
						On an Indiana river
						Than a cloudburst in Sahara
						Where they celebrate a rain!
					
				
				
				
					THE GIRLS OF FIVE-MINUTES-TO-EIGHT
					
						The old corner clock was in gossipy mood,
						And so, in a spirit of jest,
						I asked it, of all the girls that it knew,
						Which ones it thought dearest and best.
					
					
						"Just give me the Girls of Five-minutes-to-eight,"
						The street clock was quick to reply.
						"The happiest moments of all in the day
						Are when they go fluttering by.
					
					
						"In laughing battalions they hurry along
						To office, to shop and to school;
						They have but one thought-to get there at eight!-
						Their day's long enough as a rule.
					
					
					
						"I glory to see them in ginghams and lawns,
						In bonnets of dainty design;
						I smile when they call me their dear Father Time,
						Which makes them all daughters of mine.
					
					
						"They're business girls-yes, and happy ones, too,
						They've harnessed no masculine mate;
						Not one of them wishes to wash some man's dishes---
						At night-at Five-minutes-to-eight!"
