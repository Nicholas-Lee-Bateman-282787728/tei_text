				<head rend="center">PREFACE</head>
				<p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> State of Indiana is sponsor for its public schools. The State has
					kept faith with its constitutional provision for the organization and support of a uniform
					system of schools, open and free to all its citizens. To help the schools keep faith with
					the State is the purpose of this little volume.</p>
				<p>Experience proves that students do not view the State Constitution as a document with the
					interest they give it as a living instrument in action. Therefore, instead of relegating
					it to the Appendix, where at best it has the appearance of a skeleton at a feast, the
					Constitution has been made the center of the book, and, let us hope, the center of
					interest. The various subjects treated in the Constitution are classified as far as
					possible without destroying the original order, and comment follows each quotation. The
					chapter on the relation of state and federal government is the logical link between the
					two systems, regardless of the order in which they may be presented. The introduction of a
					historical element, the tying together of paragraphs by threads of interest, and the
					occasional suggestion of mental images, it is believed, will stimulate thought. In brief
					the aim of the book is to vitalize what is too often a dull subject in school. This
					vitalizing influence may be extended by the teacher. The lines of institutional life in
					the State may be followed as far as time and material will permit. The school itself is an
					embryonic state, and may be made as much of a junior republic as the teacher desires.
					However, it is true that even a detailed <pb id="VAC1016-008" n="vi"/> knowledge of the
					functions of government does not always make a good citizen. We may teach civics and miss
					that patriotism which the State rightly demands of its citizens. The larger practical good
					to the State will come from lessons in moral integrity. Without preaching at them,
					students should be led to see that a pure heart, guided by a clear mind, is the best gift
					offered at the shrine of our commonwealth.</p>
				<p>The matter-of-fact material treated has invited no attempt at literary style, but at no
					time has the author been unmindful of his obligation to be clear and concise. Criticisms
					of the book will be gratefully acknowledged.</p>

						<hi rend="sc">THE RELATION OF STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT</hi></head>
					<p><hi rend="b">1. Introduction</hi>. &mdash; The relation of State and Nation is the most
						striking characteristic of our government. The dovetailing of state and federal
						authority is so complex yet so simple, so promising of discord yet so harmonious, that
						we are forced to admire the skill of construction and the strength of union. This
						complexity is due to specialization and is necessary to the high degree of liberty
						enjoyed by our people. Daniel Webster said:&mdash; <q rend="blockquote"><p>Nothing is
								more deceptive or more dangerous than the pretense of a desire to simplify
								government. The simplest governments are despotisms; the next simplest, limited
								monarchies; but all republics, all governments of law, must impose numerous
								limitations and qualifications of authority, and give many positive and many
								qualified rights.</p></q></p>
					<note type="margin">Works, IV, 122.</note>
					<note type="margin">Freeman's <hi rend="i">History of Federal Government</hi>, 3.</note>
					<p>Our form of government has been declared the most finished production of political
						ingenuity. Seldom has it been attained in the world's history. It is possible only in a
						refined age and among a people of political education.</p>
					<note type="margin">Meaning of the term <hi rend="i">State</hi>.</note>
					<p><hi rend="b">2. The State</hi>. &mdash; The term <hi rend="i">State</hi> is here used
						in distinction from <hi rend="i">Nation</hi>. A State is one of the self-directive
						political units of the United States, having clearly defined boundaries and a republican
						form of government. The State is <pb id="VAC1016-014" n="2"/> supreme within its own
						sphere, but dependent within the sphere of the federal government. It is independent of
						every other State in all affairs which concern itself only; it is subject to the federal
						government in all affairs which concern the States collectively. Sovereignty rests
						neither in state nor federal government, but in the people who directly control both
						forms of government. The State Constitution, a written organization of government,
						stands above all legislative enactment or judicial decrees and is the highest exponent
						of the political character of the people.</p>

						<p><hi rend="b">3. Origin of State Constitutions</hi>. &mdash; State constitutions are
							the oldest forms of government in our history. They are found embodied in the charters
							granted to the earliest English settlements on our coasts. They may be traced back to
							a time preceding the discovery of America. The chartered cities of the Middle Ages
							were children of still more ancient corporations, dating back to the days of
							law-giving Rome.</p>
						<note type="margin">Bryce's <hi rend="i">American Commonwealth</hi>, I, 413.</note>
						<p><hi rend="b">4. Transition from Colony to State</hi>. &mdash; Early in the American
							Revolution there was a transition from colonial to state government. May 15, 1776,
							Congress advised the colonists to form state constitutions, which should "in the
							opinion of the representatives of the people best conduce to the happiness and safety
							of their constituents in particular, and of America in general." Naturally the
							colonists turned to their charters for material. In them provision had been made for a
							governor, with absolute veto power, usually appointed by the crown or proprietor; here
							also were found judges, usually appointed by the governor; and here was a legislature,
							the upper house of which might be <pb id="VAC1016-015" n="3"/> chosen by the governor,
							but the lower house of which was elective. In this way the colonial government
							supplied a foundation upon which to build a state government. It remained for the
							framers of the new constitutions to make the form more democratic; to separate more
							distinctly the legislative, judicial, and executive departments; to render officials,
							generally appointive under the colonial system, elective under the state system. Thus
							was prepared the new state constitution with its bill of rights, its frame of
							government, and its miscellaneous provisions for administration. The close
							relationship of State and Nation is well illustrated in the very beginning of our
							history. For these new state constitutions, suggested by a Continental Congress, in
							turn supplied material for the making of our federal Constitution.</p>
						<note type="margin">Bryce's <hi rend="i">American Commonwealth</hi>, I, 38, 40.</note>
						<p><hi rend="b">5. Supremacy of the Legislature</hi>. &mdash; At a time when their
							liberties were best represented in the legislative department of colonial government,
							the colonists were engaged in a desperate struggle with executive power. Their
							conflict with the executive, and their taste of self-government in the legislature,
							induced them to decry the former and exalt the latter. In framing the state
							constitutions the legislature was made supreme. It met annually in long sessions; it
							appointed governors and judges; in short, it was a new Parliament in the new States.
							Madison said in the constitutional convention of 1787:&mdash; <q rend="blockquote"
									><p>Experience proves a tendency in our government to throw all power into the
									legislative vortex. The executives of the States are little more than ciphers; the
									legislatures are omnipotent.</p></q></p>
						<note type="margin">Ashley's <hi rend="i">American Government</hi>, Chap. 9.</note>
						<p><hi rend="b">6. Restrictions on the Legislature</hi>. &mdash; The new States were
							scarcely organized before the people realized that they had intrusted too much to the
							legislature. The democratic spirit of the times awakened in them a consciousness of
							their <pb id="VAC1016-016" n="4"/> own ability to rule. They at once began a
							restriction of legislative power, which has continued to the present day. They
							demanded that constitutions be submitted to them for ratification. The lengthy annual
							sessions of the legislature were reduced to brief sessions every two years. The
							formation and control of the judicial department was removed from the authority of the
							legislature. The right of choosing a governor was taken away from the legislature and
							given to the people. The governor was given a veto power over legislative acts; his
							term of office was lengthened and, in many States, he was made eligible for
							reëlection. As confidence in their liberties increased the fear of executive power
							declined, and the people learned to regard the three departments of government as
							instruments in their hands.</p>
						<note type="margin">Period of Usefulness.</note>
						<p><hi rend="b">7. Growth of State Constitutions</hi>. &mdash; Since the Revolutionary
							period growth has been the distinguishing mark of state constitutions. The average age
							of service of this political servant is estimated at thirty years. Georgia and
							Louisiana each have had six frames of government, exclusive of their Secession
							documents. Pennsylvania has enacted four, Illinois three, and Indiana two. Altogether
							over one hundred constitutions have been enacted in the States of the Union.</p>
						<note type="margin">Bryce's <hi rend="i">The American Commonwealth</hi>, I, 438.</note>
						<note type="margin">Increase in Length.</note>
						<p>The earlier constitutions were brief. They were restricted to an outline of the
							organization of government, and a statement of the conditions under which laws might
							be made and enforced. With the complex growth of industrial and social life has come a
							demand that constitutions not only prescribe in detail the organization of government,
							but that they enter the field of private law and legislative enactment. The fear of
							corporation management, the distrust of legislators, and an abiding faith in democracy
							have expressed themselves in codes of law embodied in the more recent <pb
								id="VAC1016-017" n="5"/> constitutions. This mode of popular lawmaking produces
							decidedly longer documents than those of our earlier history. For instance, Virginia's
							first constitution contained four pages, her second seven, her third eighteen; her
							present constitution, written in 1870, contains twenty-two pages, or about seventeen
							thousand words. The extremes are marked in the constitution of New Hampshire (1776)
							with about six hundred words, and the constitution of Oklahoma (1907) with fifty
							thousand words.</p>

							The Continental Congress had been a place of consultation, and the Confederation an
							advisory board; but the new Constitution, together with federal laws and treaties, was
							to be "the supreme law of the land." To the federal government was given absolute
							control of all foreign relations, the postal system, the army and navy, interstate
							commerce, currency, patents, copyrights, and kindred interests; to it was intrusted
							the protection of citizens from unjust legislation in any State. In these enumerated
							powers the federal government treats its citizens as directly responsible, and its
							authority is exercised over them without the intervention of any State.</p>

						<note type="margin">Sources of Power.</note>
						<p>The amendment quoted has led to a very general notion that the States have a
							reservoir of powers which they possessed before entering the Union and which was not
							delegated to the general government. A better conception, especially in view of the
							Civil War, is that the powers indicated belong to "the people" only. It is within the
							province of the people to grant this residue of powers either to the States or to the
							federal government. But it is evident that the States are not departments of a central
							government which extends its authority over local affairs, as in France, or as the
							several States extend their authority over counties, towns, and cities. It would also
							be improper to speak of powers granted to the States since these powers, being

						<note type="margin">What the State does.</note>

							the lesser political units within its territory.</p>

							dramatic interest and incidents. As a matter of fact the average citizen rarely comes

						<p><hi rend="b">10. Concurrent Powers</hi>. &mdash; The delegation of power to the
							national government does not imply a prohibition upon the States to use the same
							power, unless it is expressly forbidden the States in the Constitution. For example,
							Congress has authority to levy internal taxes, but the power is not denied the State;
							or, both governments may borrow money. Such powers, granted to the federal government
							and also retained by the States, are known as <hi rend="i">concurrent</hi>. They

						<note type="margin">Powers denied to the Federal Government.</note>
						<p><hi rend="b">11. Denied Powers</hi>. &mdash; Since the federal government has no
							powers except those enumerated (and those implied in carrying out the enumerated
							powers), it would seem useless to deny it powers. Evidently the framers of the
							constitution feared either an encroachment on state rights or undue exercise of the
							authority granted, for they did deny certain powers to the federal government. The
							prohibitions imposed are stated in Article I, Section 9, and in the first eight
							amendments to the Constitution. These eight amendments form a bill of rights; they
							restrain the federal government but not the States.</p>
						<pb id="VAC1016-020" n="8"/>
						<note type="margin">Powers denied to the States.</note>
						<p>Indeed, at the time of the making of the federal Constitution there was more need of
							placing a guard over the States than over the Nation. The Nation was scarcely worthy
							of the name; it had not attained the strength of maturity. The States were the
							possessors of almost unlimited power and were disposed to question every tottering
							move of the general government. In a spirit of fairness, therefore, certain powers
							were denied to the States. As read in Article I, Section 10, of the Constitution,
							these prohibitions appear not so much a preventive of state encroachment on federal
							power as a definition of those duties which the States as individuals could not
							successfully perform.</p>
						<note type="margin">Powers denied to both State and Nation.</note>
						<p>It might appear that all powers denied to the States are permitted to the federal
							government, and, conversely, that all powers denied to the federal government are
							permitted to the States. But this is not true. The framers of the Constitution saw
							that there were some things which neither state nor federal government ought to do;
							therefore, certain powers were denied to both. Neither state nor federal government
							can appropriate private property for public use without compensation; neither can
							impair the obligation of contract; nor grant titles of nobility; nor pass an <hi
								rend="i">ex post facto</hi> law or bill of attainder. The makers of the Constitution
							were determined to exclude, in State and Nation, every possibility of an oppressive
							government.</p>

						<p><hi rend="b">12. Preservation of the Relation between State and Nation</hi>. &mdash;
							When two governments exercise control over the same people at the same time the
							question of authority in certain cases will naturally arise. For example, the State
							has the right to regulate the running of trains within its <pb id="VAC1016-021" n="9"
							/> boundaries; the federal government also has that right when they carry the mails.
							The State may forbid the manufacture and sale of certain articles within its
							territory; but the federal control of interstate commerce permits the articles to be
							shipped into the State. The concurrent powers relating to taxation, elections, and
							citizenship give rise to questions of authority. Whenever the powers overlap in the
							development of new interests, doubt will arise as to which authority should exercise
							control. Evidently, harmony can exist only as long as each government remains within
							its proper sphere of action. If the federal government becomes autocratic, its
							authority will be restricted; if the state government fails to serve the local needs
							of the people, its power will be absorbed by the federal government.</p>
						<note type="margin">Forman's <hi rend="i">Advanced Civics</hi>, 57.</note>
						<q rend="blockquote"><p>The States and the federal government, like the planets in their
								revolution around the sun, acting and acted upon, will move on in harmony and
								majesty only so long as a beautiful equilibrium between them is preserved.</p></q>
						<note type="margin">Little Danger from a Conflict of Powers.</note>
						<p>But the firm belief of the people that local interests are best served by the State
							and national interests by the federal government; the eminent success of the Supreme
							Court, thus far, in keeping each government within its proper sphere, are indications
							that little danger need be feared from a conflict of powers. In addition it should be
							kept in mind that the same people control both governments. To the declaration of
							Governor Wright that the selection of good county commissioners is more important than
							the selection of good congressmen might be added the equal truth that the selection of
							the former usually implies the choice of the latter, for the same people elect
							both.</p>
						<p>The greater danger lies in a poor administration of both state and federal
							government. No form of government is <pb id="VAC1016-022" n="10"/> good if it is
							poorly administered, and almost any form is good if it is well administered. If our
							highly organized and delicately adjusted system of government remains efficient under
							the control of the people, two things are absolutely essential. First, the great
							masses of the people must possess political intelligence. In no other form of
							government is intelligence on the part of all the people so necessary as in a
							democracy. Every county in the State should have men intellectually capable of filling
							the governor's chair; every State in the Union should have men available for the
							presidency. But intelligence without honesty is dangerous to government. The second
							essential, then, is moral integrity. After all, the kind of administration given by
							either party is a matter of principle rather than policy, and is based on the moral
							character of the officials rather than on party platforms. In our form of government
							every citizen should practice the sovereignty of self-reliance and the patriotism of a
							square deal.</p>

					<p><hi rend="b">13. Authority over the Territory</hi>. &mdash; It is difficult to realize
						fully that Indiana was ever subject to the dominion of kings. It seems more like a dream
						than the sober truth of history that the approval of Louis the Great was a prerequisite
						to the exploration of her lands, and commercial intercourse with her naked denizens;
						that the sensual monster Louis XV held in his hands the supreme power over the welfare
						of her first settlers; that George III controlled her course in the tottering advances
						of her infancy.</p>
					<p>France exercised control over Indiana from the time of the discovery of the Mississippi
						by La Salle in 1682 until the surrender of her territory east of that river to the
						English in 1763. Great Britain nominally retained possession until it was wrested from
						her by Colonel George Rogers Clark, in the name of Virginia, 1779. Virginia formally,
						but not effectively, governed it until the surrender of her claims in favor of the
						general government in 1784. The United States exercised authority over it as a
						territorial possession until it entered the Union of States in 1816. Thus the truth of
						history reveals the fact that the territory now forming Indiana was, at different times,
						under the dominion of three countries and one State; and that the flags of three nations
						have waved over its soil.</p>

						<note type="margin">Post Vincennes.</note>
						<note type="margin">Fort Miamis.</note>
						<p>Following in the footsteps of La Salle came the French missionaries, traders, and
							soldiers. The first trading post within the State was made in 1720 at Ouiatanon
							[We-ä'ta-non] on the Ouabache, four miles below the present site of Lafayette. The
							location of this post, at the head of river navigation for large boats, made it a
							point of commercial and military importance for a brief time. It never became a
							settlement of any size, and every vestige of its existence has long since disappeared.
							Vincennes, named after its founder, was established as a post about 1727, and is the
							only one of the earliest settlements which grew into a town. Fort Miamis, near the
							present site of Fort Wayne, was the only other post established in the early days of
							French occupation. Post Vincennes was included in the province of Louisiana; Ouiatanon
							and Fort Miamis belonged to Canada and were under control of the commandant at
							Detroit.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">15. Character and Influence of the French</hi>. &mdash; The period of
							French supremacy may not be traced in the present language, customs, or laws of the
							State; in only a few communities can the descendants of the daring and
							generous-hearted wood rangers be found to-day. Indifferent to what we call political
							rights, they established no form of civil government. Few in number and here for a
							brief season only, they developed none of the natural resources of the country.
							Agriculture, when carried on at all, was of the rudest kind. The whole character of
							the French was <pb id="VAC1016-028" n="14"/> especially fitted for a first contact
							with savage life in the wilderness; and their chief employment was what the situation
							offered, &mdash; trading in furs.</p>
						<p>In 1778 the annual fur trade of Vincennes and Ouiatanon was estimated at $25,000 and
							$40,000, respectively. Who was so well fitted to collect this wealth as the French <hi
								rend="i">voyageurs</hi>? Who could endure hardship, patrol the forests, or placate
							the Indians as well as the <hi rend="i">coureurs de bois</hi>? With the silence of
							time on their vices and the glamour of tradition on their virtues, they seem to belong
							to an age of poetry and romance.</p>
						<q rend="blockquote"><p>We see them gliding along the streams in their canoes, shapely
								and serviceable as any water craft that man has ever designed, and yet buoyant and
								fragile as the wind-whirled autumn leaf. We catch afar off the thrilling cadence of
								their choruses, floating over prairie and marsh, echoing from forest and hill,
								startling the buffalo from his haunt in the reeds, telling the drowsy denizens of
								the posts of the approach of revelry, and whispering to the Indian village of gaudy
								fabrics, of trinkets, and of fire water. We feel the genial warmth of the camp fire
								that breaks the chill of the night wind, and dissipates the fog which rises from
								stream, bayou, and marsh, as the men gather about it and whiff the narcotic incense
								from their stumpy pipes; or later on, when they bring forth the inevitably greasy
								pillows, roll in their grimy blankets, and speed away to dreamland. Another night
								they have reached the little post, and we are overwhelmed by the confusion of
								chattering, laughing, singing, and bargaining; we almost taste the fiery brandy that
								is rapidly preparing them for the wild whirl of the dance and the delirium of the
								debauch beyond.</p></q>

						<p><hi rend="b">16. Transfer of Authority</hi>. &mdash; France never held undisputed
							possession of the territory embracing Indiana. Her claims, resting on discovery,
							exploration, and actual occupation, were doubtless most substantial. But England also
							claimed the territory on account of her discoveries, explorations, and treaties with
							the Indians. The contest which culminated in the French and Indian War determined
							whether the Mississippi Valley should be French or English. After the surrender of
							Quebec and Montreal the French gave up Canada (1760). In 1761 Ouiatanon was occupied
							by the British. Vincennes was not surrendered until the end of the war (1763), nor
							occupied by the British until 1777.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">17. Pontiac's Conspiracy</hi>. &mdash; The Indians were unwilling to
							exchange their companionable French masters for the blunt, though honest, English.
							They had not learned that the English were more ready to pay for their lands than the
							French had been. A conspiracy under Pontiac was all but successful in driving out the
							English. Of all the forts west of Pittsburg, Detroit alone withstood his attacks.
							Finally convinced of the folly of the struggle, he declared for peace with the English
							at Ouiatanon in 1765.</p>
						<note type="margin">Freedom granted to French.</note>
						<p><hi rend="b">18. British Dominion</hi>. &mdash; Upon occupation of the territory by

						<p>Immediately after the French and Indian War, colonists <pb id="VAC1016-030" n="16"/>
							from the Atlantic seaboard began moving westward. It is estimated that within three
							years thirty thousand settlers had passed into the over-mountain country. The English
							government, jealous of this expanding power of the colonists, and ready to enlist the
							sympathies of the French in the event of trouble, issued the famous Quebec Act of
							1774. By this act the home government sought to exclude the colonists from the
							Northwest by extending the limits of Quebec to the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. The
							act also restored French law, abolished the right of trial by jury in civil cases, and
							guaranteed extensive property rights to the Catholic clergy. But in spite of the acts
							of Parliament and the proclamations of the king the hardy pioneer colonists penetrated
							the interior.</p>

							allies of the Indians; and these they incited to acts of barbarity against the
							colonists.</p>
						<note type="margin">George Rogers Clark.</note>
						<p>To put an end to Indian cruelty and British perfidy, Colonel George Rogers Clark, a
							Virginian residing in Kentucky, determined on the conquest of the Northwest.
							Commissioned by Governor Patrick Henry and encouraged by Thomas Jefferson of his
							native State, he undertook a task the magnitude and success of which won for him the
							title of "The Hannibal of the West." With one hundred and fifty-three men this
							indomitable leader marched from the present site of Louisville to Kaskaskia on the
							Mississippi, which post he captured July 4, 1778. From this point he <pb
								id="VAC1016-031" n="17"/> dispatched a small force under Captain Helm to take
							possession of Vincennes. The British forces were absent when Captain Helm arrived, but
							returned in December under General Hamilton with a force of thirty regulars, fifty
							Canadians, and four hundred Indians.</p>
						<note type="margin">Woodburn and Moran's <hi rend="i">American History and
								Government</hi>, 481.</note>
						<q rend="blockquote"><p>Captain Helm, in command of one man, was in the fort when
								Hamilton appeared. Helm, however, was not in a submissive mood, and standing over a
								loaded cannon, with a burning match in his hand, he refused to surrender until he
								had been promised the "honors of war." This being done, Helm marched his force of
								one man out of the fort with due pomp and ceremony.</p></q>
						<p>More serious was the determination of Colonel Clark to recapture the fort. In the
							following February he began a notable march across Illinois. The country had been
							flooded, and often his men were forced to wade all day, breaking the thin ice before
							them. Says Clark, "Many would reach the shore, and fall with their bodies half in the
							water, not being able to support themselves without it." When the fort was reached the
							men were exhausted, but the iron will of the leader was undaunted. He attacked the
							fort, and after a hard fight of a day and a night forced its surrender. The capture of
							this post gave the Northwest to the immediate care of Virginia, and assured its
							cession to the United States in the treaty of 1782-1783. As a partial acknowledgment
							of the service, which was perhaps more important than Colonel Clark ever realized,
							Virginia, with the later approval of the general government, gave to the gallant
							leader and his men fifty thousand acres of land in the south part of the State.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">20. Virginia Authority in Indiana</hi>. &mdash; Soon after Colonel Clark
							had taken possession of Kaskaskia, and before General Hamilton had surrendered to him
							at Vincennes, the legislature of Virginia passed an ordinance for the <pb
								id="VAC1016-032" n="18"/> government of the territory northwest of the Ohio. The
							entire region was called the County of Illinois, over which the Governor of Virginia
							appointed a County-lieutenant. He, in turn, had power to appoint as many deputy
							officials as he deemed proper. Local officers were to be "chosen by a majority of
							citizens in their respective districts." Under this organization of civil power, the
							first election ever held in Indiana took place in 1779. The statutory organization of
							the County of Illinois expired by its own limitation in one year; but the officers
							chosen at this first election continued to exercise unquestioned authority. The judges
							generously divided an old Indian grant, twenty-four leagues square, among themselves,
							each one in turn modestly absenting himself on the day his associates granted him his
							portion. The United States repudiated the action.</p>

							the jurisdiction exercised over the Northwest by Virginia, the States of
							Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New York laid claim to parts of the same, by reason of
							charter rights and Indian treaties. Fortunately, Maryland refused to ratify the
							Articles of Confederation until the general government assumed control of the western
							lands, regardless of rival claims. Virginia deeded her claims to the United States in
							1784, and within three years the other States had relinquished their claims.</p>

						<p><hi rend="b">22. Ordinances</hi>. &mdash; The government of the northwestern lands
							called for the highest order of statesmanship. In 1784 Congress provided a temporary
							government, but it was never enforced. In 1785 Congress provided for the survey of the
							land and the reservation of every sixteenth section for school purposes. But it was
							the Ordinance of 1787 of which Daniel <pb id="VAC1016-033" n="19"/> Webster said, "I
							doubt whether one single law of any law-giver, ancient or modern, has produced effects
							of more distinct, marked, and lasting character." (See the Ordinance of 1787, in
							Appendix.) Before the district now embraced in Indiana had a population sufficient for
							territorial organization it was controlled by a Governor and judges appointed by
							Congress. General Arthur St. Clair was appointed as first Governor, and established
							the seat of government at Marietta, Ohio, in 1788. In 1790 Knox County, embracing
							Indiana and parts of Michigan and Illinois, was organized, with Vincennes as the
							county seat. Then followed the first effective civil government Indiana had known in
							ten years.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">23. Indiana Territory</hi>. &mdash; In 1798 it was determined that the
							Northwest Territory contained the requisite number of male inhabitants (5000) to
							secure a territorial form of government of the second grade. This permitted the
							organization of a legislature, which, in turn, had the right to select a delegate to
							Congress. The first legislative assembly convened at Cincinnati in 1799 and selected
							William Henry Harrison delegate to Congress.</p>
						<note type="margin">The Northwest Territory divided.</note>
						<p>In 1800 Congress divided the Northwest Territory by a line running north from
							Cincinnati to the national boundary. All east of this line retained the old name, but
							all west of it was called Indiana Territory. The government of Indiana Territory as
							thus formed began at Vincennes July 4, 1800, with William Henry Harrison as Governor.
							In five years this territory passed to the second stage of government; a legislature
							was organized, and Benjamin Parke selected as delegate to Congress.</p>
						<note type="margin">Indiana Territory divided.</note>
						<p>In 1805 Congress divided Indiana Territory by the creation of Michigan on the north;
							and, in 1809, again reduced it by the creation of Illinois Territory on the west. This
							last pruning of Indiana Territory left it with practically the <pb id="VAC1016-034"
								n="20"/> same boundaries which the State has at present. With a population of
							seventeen thousand, and one third of the lands already purchased from the Indians, she
							started on her way toward Statehood.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">24. Indian Troubles</hi>. &mdash; In the year 1809 three million acres
							of land were purchased of several Indian tribes. The aggressive Shawnee warrior
							Tecumseh, alarmed lest the sale of land should deprive his people of their homes,
							formed a conspiracy in 1811 for the purpose of driving out the whites. His contention
							was that no land should be sold by chiefs without the consent of all the tribes. In a
							conference with Governor Harrison at Vincennes, Tecumseh sought to have the lands thus
							sold returned to the Indians. He said, in part:&mdash; <note type="margin">Tecumseh's
								Speech. </note>
							<q rend="blockquote"><p>Brother, you ought to know what you are doing with the
									Indians. Perhaps it is by direction of the President to make these distinctions.
									It is a very bad thing and we do not like it. Since my residence at Tippecanoe we
									have endeavored to level all distinctions; to destroy village chiefs, by whom the
									mischief is done. It is they who sell our land to the Americans. Our object is to
									let all our affairs be transacted by warriors.</p></q>
							<note type="margin">Dillon's <hi rend="i">History of Indiana</hi>, 443-444.</note>
							<q rend="blockquote"><p>Brother, I wish you would take pity on the red people and do
									what I have requested. If you do not give up the land and do cross the boundary of
									your present settlement, it will be very hard and will produce great trouble among
									us. How can we have confidence in the white people? When Jesus Christ came upon
									earth you slew him and nailed him upon the cross. You thought he was dead, but you
									were mistaken.</p></q></p>
						<p>When Governor Harrison informed Tecumseh that the President would decide the
							question, he replied:&mdash; <q rend="blockquote"><p>As the great chief is to
									determine the matter, I hope the Great Spirit will put sense enough into his head
									to induce him to direct you to give up this land. It is true he is so far off he
									will not be injured by the war. He may sit still in his town, and drink his wine,
									while you and I will have to fight it out.</p></q></p>
						<pb id="VAC1016-035" n="21"/>
						<note type="margin">The Battle of Tippecanoe.</note>
						<p>In the battle of Tippecanoe it was fought out. Unable to placate the Indians or stop
							their depredations, Governor Harrison marched into their territory with a force of
							nine hundred men. Seven miles north of Lafayette he encamped on a triangular knoll of
							woodland, near the Tippecanoe. Here, in the early morning of November 7, 1811, he was
							fiercely attacked by Tecumseh's brother, "The Prophet," with a force of Indians
							variously estimated at from three hundred and fifty to one thousand. In a sharp
							engagement the Indians were routed and their confederacy crushed. Harrison's force had
							thirty-seven men shot down in the light of their own camp fires, and twenty-five
							afterward died of wounds.</p>
						<note type="margin">Pigeon Roost Massacre.</note>
						<p>Encouraged by our trouble with Great Britain, the Indians committed occasional
							outrages while the War of 1812 lasted. The most serious of these was the massacre of
							three men, five women, and sixteen children at Pigeon Roost settlement in Scott County
							in 1812.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">25. Slavery</hi>. &mdash; One of the most important subjects discussed
							previous to the formation of the state Constitution was that of slavery. Slaves were
							brought into the territory by the earliest French settlers, and the institution
							continued to exist in spite of the provision against it in the Ordinance of 1787.
							Between 1796 and 1807 six petitions were presented to Congress asking for the
							abrogation of that article in the Ordinance which forbade slavery. (See Art. 6,
							Ordinance of 1787, Appendix.) A law of indenture provided that negroes coming into the
							territory under contract should be compelled to serve the specified time, and that
							such service might be sold as personal property. In 1810 there were two hundred and
							thirty-seven slaves in the territory. But in the constitutional convention the
							antislavery party triumphed, and the State was free. The name of Jonathan Jennings is
							most prominent as an early advocate for freedom.</p>

						<head rend="center">S<hi rend="sc">TATEHOOD</hi></head>
						<p><hi rend="b">26. Admitted to the Union</hi>. &mdash; By an act of the legislature the
							capital of Indiana Territory was removed from Vincennes to Corydon in 1813. A census
							ordered by the legislature soon afterward showed a population of 63,897 in the
							thirteen counties, more than the number required for Statehood. In 1815 the
							legislature petitioned Congress for admission into the Union. Congress granted an
							Enabling Act (see Appendix) providing for an election of delegates to a constitutional
							convention. The convention met at Corydon and the delegates completed a State
							Constitution, June 29, 1816. December 11, 1816, Congress formally introduced Indiana
							to the sisterhood of States.</p>
						<note type="margin">The New Harmony Settlement.</note>
						<p><hi rend="b">27. An Experiment in Socialism</hi>. &mdash; The organization of a
							social settlement on the Wabash, in Posey County, brought to the State many
							distinguished visitors and colored the early life of the commonwealth. The New Harmony
							settlement was founded by George Rapp in 1815, and purchased by Robert Owen and
							associates in 1825. Its purpose was the creation of a community of social equality. It
							was a splendid dream; but, like other communistic dreams, proved as impracticable as
							it was visionary. During its palmy days it attained more than a national reputation;
							it contributed not a little to scientific progress; and, best of all, it attracted men
							who later became prominent in the service of State and Nation.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">28. A New Capital and a New Constitution</hi>. &mdash; By an act of
							Congress in 1816 four sections of land were appropriated for a new capital. In 1820
							commissioners selected the present seat of government, near the geographical center of
							the State, and in 1825 the capital was removed to Indianapolis.</p>
						<p>In 1850 the state legislature authorized the assembling of <pb id="VAC1016-037"
								n="23"/> a convention for the purpose of framing a new Constitution. One hundred and
							fifty delegates met in October of the same year, and after four months' deliberation
							presented the present Constitution to the people (35). It was ratified August 4, 1851,
							and a new period in the life of the State was begun.</p>
						<note type="margin">Roadways.</note>
						<p><hi rend="b">29. Internal Improvements</hi>. &mdash; Transportation facilities are
							highly necessary for the development of a commonwealth. The general government
							assisted in building a national road from Baltimore westward toward the Mississippi.
							This road penetrated the State near the middle of its eastern boundary, passing
							through Richmond, Greenfield, Indianapolis (Washington Street), Greencastle, and Terre
							Haute. While dragging its weary length across the State of Illinois it was overtaken
							by steam railroad lines and was never completed. A roadway from Madison in the south
							to Michigan City in the north was built by the State. These and other roadways were
							valuable for travel rather than the carrying of freight.</p>
						<note type="margin">The Wabash-Erie Canal.</note>
						<p>More important was an elaborate system of canals which the State undertook to build.
							Of these the Wabash and Erie was most important. It provided a waterway from Toledo to
							southern Indiana by way of Fort Wayne, Logansport, Lafayette, and Terre Haute.
							Although used only a brief time after it was built, its value is illustrated in the
							following quotation:&mdash; <note type="margin">Benton's <hi rend="i">The Wabash Trade
									Route in the Development of the Northwest</hi>, 109.</note>
							<q rend="blockquote"><p>As late as 1840 the farmers of Delphi were hauling their wheat
									to Michigan City and selling it for forty-five cents a bushel, and paying nine
									dollars a barrel for salt; but in less than two years, when the canal had reached
									that place, the same farmers obtained one dollar a bushel for their wheat and
									bought salt for less than four dollars a barrel.</p></q></p>
						<p>Nowhere is the development of transportation lines better illustrated than in
							Indiana. Lying side by side between <pb id="VAC1016-038" n="24"/> Fort Wayne and
							Lafayette are the following lines of transportation: the Wabash River, the old canal,
							a steam car line, and an electric car line. Nineteen steam trunk lines now cross the
							State, wholly or in part, from east to west; seven lines pass from north to south,
							while a perfect network of electric lines radiate from the capital city.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">30. Military Record</hi>. &mdash; Indiana's record in the wars of the
							Union reflects honor and loyalty on her name. Her part in the Revolution has been
							noted. Her pioneers were at the front in the War of 1812. She supplied over four
							thousand troops for the Mexican War. The first call for her quota of six thousand men
							in the Civil War was answered by twenty thousand volunteers. Altogether she furnished
							over two hundred thousand soldiers for the suppression of the Rebellion. The invasion
							of the State by Morgan in 1863 met no welcome. Equally praiseworthy were her sons in
							the Spanish-American War.</p>
						<note type="margin">James A. Woodburn in <hi rend="i">Report of American Historical
								Association</hi>, 1902, I, 225-226.</note>
						<p><hi rend="b">31. National Politics</hi>. &mdash; For nearly a half century after the
							admission of Indiana into the Union her electoral vote was given to the Democratic
							party, except when William Henry Harrison was the Whig candidate. This partiality
							toward Jeffersonian democracy is explained by the early settlement of the south part
							of the State by immigrants from Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, and the Carolinas. With
							the settlement of the northern part of the State by immigrants from the Northern and
							Eastern States it ceased to be solidly Democratic. Since the Civil War it has been
							pivotal in party contests. From 1868 to 1892 a candidate from Indiana was secured by
							one party or the other for the presidential ticket. In recent years the State has been
							carried by large Republican majorities.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">32. Natural Resources</hi>. &mdash; A rich soil has been the source of
							life and wealth since the days of the fur traders. But <pb id="VAC1016-039" n="25"/>
							the first settlers found this soil covered with scarcely less valuable forests of
							somber beauty and grandeur. One fifth of the State's surface is underlaid with coal,
							the annual output of which is more than ten million tons. Vast reservoirs of gas and
							petroleum have been tapped, while clays, shale, marl, and peat are known to have
							values. Indiana outranks any other State in the Union in her building stones; her
							beautiful blue or buff tinted limestone is used in thirty States and three foreign
							countries. These natural resources of the State present a background of ages upon
							which is projected a short century of human development; what use an intelligent
							people will make of them is beyond the vision of the present.</p>
						<note type="margin"><hi rend="i">Twenty-first Report of State Geologist</hi>.</note>
						<p><hi rend="b">33. Industries</hi>. &mdash; Judged by the number of persons employed
							and capital invested, agriculture is the most important industry in the State,
							although in the value of its products it is second to manufactures. The State has been
							favored in the conditions of its economic development from forest to field and from
							field to factory.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">34. The People</hi>. &mdash; The population of Indiana is native and
							permanent. Although situated in the pathway of migration, only six per cent of its
							people are foreign born. Of the foreign element one half is German and the remainder
							is chiefly Irish and English, &mdash; all thrifty scions of our parent stock. Having
							always lived near the currents of national life, the Hoosiers have no peculiarities of
							manner, custom, or speech which differentiate them from the residents of sister
							States. Since the arduous duties of establishing a commonwealth have been performed,
							more attention may be given to the graces of civilization; to the humane, cultural,
							and artistic impulses which mark the highest type of citizenship.</p>

						<hi rend="sc">THE CONSTITUTION AND GOVERNMENT</hi></head>
					<p><hi rend="b">35. The New Constitution</hi>. &mdash; The Constitution of 1816 provided
						that every twelfth year the question of calling a constitutional convention should be
						submitted to the people at a general election. Four times was this proposition submitted
						before a majority of the people voted (1849) to place the sovereignty of the State in
						the hands of a convention. The causes which culminated in the making of the new
						Constitution of 1851 are reflected in the Constitution itself.</p>
					<p><hi rend="b">36. The Preamble</hi>. &mdash; The Preamble is the enacting clause of the
						Constitution, and states the purposes of its creation as follows:&mdash; <q
							rend="blockquote"><p>To the end that justice be established, public order maintained,
								and liberty perpetuated: We, the people of the State of Indiana, grateful to
								Almighty God for the free exercise of the right to choose our own form of
								government, do ordain this Constitution.</p></q></p>
					<div3 type="chapter">
						<head rend="center">T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> B<hi rend="sc">ILL OF</hi> R<hi rend="sc"
								>IGHTS</hi></head>
						<note type="margin">Article I</note>
						<p><hi rend="b">37. Rights Reserved</hi>. &mdash; The first thirty-seven sections of the
							Constitution enumerate certain civil, political, and religious rights which belong to
							the people, and may not be usurped by the government. Many of them are taken from the
							great English charters which were wrested by our forefathers from unwilling kings.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">38. Natural Rights</hi>. &mdash; S<hi rend="sc">ECTION</hi> 1. We
							declare that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator <pb
								id="VAC1016-044" n="28"/> with certain unalienable rights; that among these are
							life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that all power is inherent in the people;
							and that all free governments are, and of right ought to be, founded on their
							authority, and instituted for their peace, safety, and well-being. For the advancement
							of these ends, the people have at all times an indefeasible right to alter and reform
							their government.</p>
						<p>The provisions of this section were taken directly from the Declaration of
							Independence. The equality asserted is political, not social. On election day only are
							all men equal. Unalienable rights are those which can never be given away. An
							agreement to surrender them would not be binding. When forfeited because of crime, the
							State takes them, presumably without the consent of the individual.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">39. Religious Freedom</hi>. &mdash; S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 2. All men
							shall be secured in their natural right to worship Almighty God according to the
							dictates of their own consciences.</p>
						<p>S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 3. No law shall, in any case whatever, control the free
							exercise and enjoyment of religious opinions, or interfere with the rights of
							conscience.</p>
						<p>S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 4. No preference shall be given, by law, to any creed,
							religious society or mode of worship; and no man shall be compelled to attend, erect
							or support any place of worship, or to maintain any ministry against his consent.</p>
						<p>S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 5. No religious test shall be required as a qualification for
							any office of trust or profit.</p>
						<p>S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 6. No money shall be drawn from the treasury for the benefit
							of any religious or theological institution.</p>
						<p>S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 7. No person shall be rendered incompetent as a witness, in
							consequence of his opinion on matters of religion.</p>
						<p>S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 8. The mode of administering an oath or affirmation shall be
							such as may be most consistent with, and binding upon, the conscience of the person to
							whom such oath or affirmation may be administered.</p>
						<p>The complete separation of Church and State is a principle in American government.
							The federal government <pb id="VAC1016-045" n="29"/> leaves the protection of citizens
							in matters of religion to their respective States. As late as 1877 the Constitution of
							New Hampshire required certain officers to be adherents of the Protestant religion. In
							Indiana the separation of Church and State is complete, Sunday laws even not being
							considered religious laws. The form of oath usually administered by a judge or clerk
							is as follows:&mdash; <q rend="blockquote"><p>You do solemnly swear that you will tell
									the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth in the case now on trial: so
									help you God.</p></q></p>
						<p>But an affirmation will answer.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">40. Freedom of Speech</hi>. &mdash; S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 9. No law
							shall be passed restraining the free interchange of thought and opinion, or
							restricting the right to speak, write, or print, freely, on any subject whatever; but
							for the abuse of that right every person shall be responsible.</p>
						<p>S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 10. In all prosecutions for libel, the truth of the matters
							alleged to be libelous may be given in justification.</p>
						<p>Freedom of speech allows the fullest publicity of all public and private affairs,
							providing always that the truth be told. An injurious truth may not be told except for
							a justifiable reason. Slander is malicious defamation of a person by means of speech;
							libel, by means of written or spoken words.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">41. Unreasonable Search or Seizure</hi>. &mdash; S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>.
							11. The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects,
							against unreasonable search or seizure shall not be violated, and no warrant shall
							issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly
							describing the place to be searched, and the person or thing to be seized.</p>
						<p>It has been said that a man's house is his castle. It may not be invaded without a
							search warrant from a magistrate, issued as indicated.</p>
						<pb id="VAC1016-046" n="30"/>
						<p><hi rend="b">42. Open Courts</hi>. &mdash; S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 12. All courts
							shall be open; and every man, for injury done to him, in his person, property or
							reputation, shall have remedy by due course of law. Justice shall be administered
							freely and without purchase; completely, and without denial; speedily, and without
							delay.</p>
						<p>Every individual may have a public trial for any legal injury. But he must await his
							turn in court.</p>
						<note type="margin">In Jeopardy once only.</note>
						<p><hi rend="b">43. Rights of the Accused</hi>. &mdash; S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 13. In
							all criminal prosecutions the accused shall have the right to a public trial, by an
							impartial jury in the county in which the offense shall have been committed; to be
							heard by himself and counsel; to demand the nature and cause of the accusation against
							him, and to have a copy thereof; to meet the witness face to face, and to have
							compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor.</p>
						<p>S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 14. No person shall be put in jeopardy twice for the same
							offense. No person, in any criminal prosecution, shall be compelled to testify against
							himself.</p>
						<p>S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 15. No person arrested, or confined in jail, shall be treated
							with unnecessary rigor.</p>
						<note type="margin">Excessive Bail.</note>
						<p>S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 16. Excessive bail shall not be required. Excessive fines
							shall not be imposed. Cruel and unusual punishment shall not be inflicted. All
							penalties shall be proportioned to the nature of the offense.</p>
						<p>S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 17. Offenses, other than murder or treason, shall be bailable
							by sufficient sureties. Murder or treason shall not be bailable when the proof is
							evident, or the presumption strong.</p>
						<p>If the accused wishes he may have his case sent to another county for trial. This is
							called a <hi rend="i">change of venue</hi>. If convicted the accused may be tried
							again, providing he can show irregularities to have existed in the first trial.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">44. Reformatory Laws</hi>. &mdash; S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 18. The penal
							code shall be founded on the principles of reformation, and not of vindictive
							justice.</p>
						<p>The law may have two objects in view in dealing with the criminal. It may seek to
							punish him for having <pb id="VAC1016-047" n="31"/> violated the law; or it may seek
							to reform him, so that he will not commit another crime. In recent years Indiana has
							emphasized the reformation of criminals with most gratifying results.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">45. Trial by Jury</hi>. &mdash; S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 19. In all
							criminal cases whatever, the jury shall have the right to determine the law and the
							facts.</p>
						<p>S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 20. In all civil cases the right of trial by jury shall
							remain inviolate.</p>
						<p>The right of trial by jury was brought from England, and may be traced back to our
							Anglo-Saxon ancestors. In Indiana the jury must unanimously agree that the accused is
							guilty before there is conviction. Criminal cases arise out of the violation of the
							law; civil cases out of a difference in the interpretation of the law.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">46. Compensation for Service or Property</hi>. &mdash; S<hi rend="sc"
								>EC</hi>. 21. No man's particular services shall be demanded without just
							compensation. No man's property shall be taken by law without just compensation; nor,
							except in case of the State, without such compensation first assessed and
							tendered.</p>
						<p>The State may demand the services of its citizens, but not without pay. It may
							appropriate private property, &mdash; the right of eminent domain, &mdash; but it must
							compensate the owner. A private corporation must tender the compensation before it can
							appropriate private property for public use.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">47. Protection to Debtors</hi>. &mdash; S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 22. The
							privilege of the debtor to enjoy the necessary comforts of life shall be recognized by
							wholesome laws, exempting a reasonable amount of property from seizure or sale for the
							payment of any debt or liability hereafter contracted; and there shall be no
							imprisonment for debt, except in case of fraud.</p>
						<p>In order that the individual, or family, may not become dependent on the State,
							debtors who are householders are <pb id="VAC1016-048" n="32"/> permitted to retain the
							sum of six hundred dollars. In the early history of Indiana, as well as in many other
							States, a man could be imprisoned for debt; but now freedom is counted more important

						<p>The writ of <hi rend="i">habeas corpus</hi> is issued by a judge having competent

						<p>The right to ask for a redress of grievances, or the right of petition, was secured

							Board of Election Commissioners, whose duty it is to prepare and distribute ballots
							for the election of state officers. These ballots contain the names of the candidates,

							him the proper ballots and a pencil. The voter then retires to an unoccupied booth in
							the room and marks the several ballots as desired. If he wishes to vote a straight
							party ticket he places a cross in the circle at the head of that ticket; otherwise, he
							makes a cross on the square preceding the name of each person for whom he wishes to
							vote. After marking the ballots he folds them separately so that the initials of the
							poll clerks' names may be seen, and hands them to the inspector or one of the judges.
							The ballots are then deposited in the boxes in his presence.</p>
						<p>Immediately after the hour for closing the election the <pb id="VAC1016-054" n="38"/>

						<p>That department of government which makes laws is now considered most important. The

						<p><hi rend="b">62. Composition</hi>. &mdash; S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 2. The Senate
							shall not exceed fifty, nor the House of Representatives one hundred members; and they
							shall be chosen by the electors of the respective counties or districts into which the

						<p>The number of senators and representatives is now as large as the Constitution
							permits. A larger number would be less effective.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">63. Terms of Office</hi>. &mdash; S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 3. Senators
							shall be elected for the term of four years, and representatives for the term of two

							senators elect, at the second meeting of the General Assembly under this Constitution,
							shall be divided, by lot, into two equal classes, as nearly as may be; and the seats
							of senators of the first class shall be vacated at the expiration of two years, and
							those of the second class at the expiration of four years; so that one half, as nearly
							as possible, shall be chosen biennially forever thereafter. And in case of increase in
							the number of senators, they shall be so annexed by lot, to the one or the other of
							the two classes, as to keep them as nearly equal as practicable.</p>
						<p>The division of the Senate into two classes insures the presence of some experienced
							legislators at each session.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">64. Apportionment</hi>. &mdash; S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 4. The General

							every sixth year thereafter, cause an enumeration to be made of all the male
							inhabitants over the age of twenty-one years.</p>
						<p>S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 5. The number of senators and representatives shall, at the
							session next following each period of making such enumeration, be fixed by law, and
							apportioned among the several counties, according to the number of male inhabitants,
							above twenty-one years of age, in each: Provided, That the first and second elections
							of members of the <pb id="VAC1016-056" n="40"/> General Assembly, under this
							Constitution, shall be according to the apportionment last made by the General
							Assembly before the adoption of this Constitution.</p>
						<p>S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 6. A senatorial or representative district, where more than
							one county shall constitute a district, shall be composed of contiguous counties; and
							no county, for senatorial apportionment, shall ever be divided.</p>
						<p>The enumeration of voters is for the purpose of re-districting the State. These
							districts may not be arranged at any other time than at the session following the
							enumeration, unless a previous legislature has neglected the opportunity. The
							opportunity is the privilege given the party in power to "Gerrymander" the State; that
							is, to arrange the districts advantageously for the party. Several counties may form
							one district; or, where the population is large, as in Marion County, several senators
							may be elected from the same district. (See map.)</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">65. Qualifications of Senators and Representatives</hi>. &mdash; S<hi

							one year next preceding his election, an inhabitant of the county or district whence
							he may be chosen. Senators shall be at least twenty-five, and representatives at least
							twenty-one years of age.</p>

						<p>S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 11. Two thirds of each house shall constitute a quorum to do

						<note type="margin">Officers.</note>
						<note type="margin">Clerks.</note>
						<p>The Lieutenant-governor is <hi rend="i">ex officio</hi> President of the Senate. The
							Senate also elects a President <hi rend="i">pro tempore</hi> who presides when the
							Lieutenant-governor is absent. The House of Representatives selects a presiding
							officer, known as the Speaker, from its own membership. The Senate elects a Secretary
							and the House of Representatives a Clerk, whose duties are to keep the records of each
							body. These clerks appoint assistant clerks in their respective <pb id="VAC1016-060"
								n="42"/> houses as follows: a file clerk, a reading clerk, an indorsing clerk, three
							engrossing clerks, three enrolling clerks, one folding clerk, one minute clerk, one
							journal clerk and five copying clerks. Each house has a doorkeeper, with assistants.
							Five pages and one messenger, usually boys, serve each house. Each house also has its
							own postmaster, who receives and distributes mail to members and officers.</p>
						<p>At the time of organization the Lieutenant-governor, or in his absence the Auditor of
							State, presides over the Senate. In like manner the Secretary of State presides over
							the House of Representatives. From the official returns in the office of the Secretary
							of State is secured a roll of the members, to whom the oath of office is administered

						<p>When either house wishes to consider a subject with all the freedom of an ordinary

						<p><hi rend="b">70. Discipline</hi>. &mdash; S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 14. Either house

							imprisonment, any person not a member, who shall have been guilty of disrespect to the

							shall not, at any time, exceed twenty-four hours.</p>
						<p>In addition to the constitutional provisions for discipline the General Assembly
							sometimes finds it prudent to make rules restricting the action of "lobbyists,"
							&mdash; individuals who are not members of either house but who attempt to influence
							legislation through personal agencies.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">71. Law-making</hi>. &mdash; S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 16. Each house

						<p>S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 17. Bills may originate in either house, but may be amended
							or rejected in the other, except that bills for raising revenue shall originate in the
							House of Representatives.</p>
						<p>S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 18. Every bill shall be read by sections, on three several
							days in each house; unless, in case of emergency, two-thirds of the house where such
							bill may be depending shall, by a vote of yeas and nays, deem it expedient to dispense
							with this rule; but the reading of a bill by sections, on its final passage, shall in
							no case be dispensed with; and the vote on the passage of every bill or joint
							resolution shall be taken by yeas and nays.</p>
						<p>S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 19. Every act shall embrace but one subject, and matters
							properly connected therewith; which subject shall be expressed in the title. But if

							such act shall be void only as to so much thereof as shall not be expressed in the
							title.</p>
						<p>S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 20. Every act and joint resolution shall be plainly <pb

						<p>S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 21. No act shall ever be revised or amended by mere reference
							to its title; but the act revised, or section amended, shall be set forth and
							published at full length.</p>
						<p>In law-making one of the cardinal principles to be kept in view is clearness of
							language. The statutes of Indiana are not as well written as those of some of the
							older States, or of the United States, but the Constitution evidently means to have
							them clear.</p>
						<note type="margin">Committees.</note>
						<note type="margin">The Passage of a Bill.</note>
						<p>When a bill is introduced into either house it is usually read by title, and referred
							to an appropriate committee. Most of the work of the General Assembly is performed by
							committees. They may be said to be necessary evils. They divide responsibility,
							prevent unity of action, increase opportunities for corruption; yet without them the
							Assembly could consider only a small fraction of the many bills proposed. A bill may
							be rejected at once, or it may not be reported by the committee to which it is
							referred; in either case it is said to be "killed." If it is reported favorably by the
							committee, with or without amendments, it is filed in order on the presiding officer's
							desk. When reached again in the order of business it is read a second time. It is now
							ready for serious discussion, and may be rejected, amended, or recommitted. If
							considered favorably, it is engrossed and referred to a committee which compares it
							carefully with the original bill. It is now ready for the third reading, and final
							consideration. If passed, the engrossed copy is signed by the clerk and transmitted to
							the other house, which considers it in like manner. When approved by a majority of the
							members of both houses it is signed by their presiding officers and sent to the
							Governor for his approval or veto. (See Art. V, Sec. 14.)</p>

						<p>Under the Constitution of 1816 the statute books of the State were filled with
							special legislation. Every city and town was incorporated by special acts of the
							legislature. Schools, libraries, railroads, manufacturing and trading companies,
							planing mills, and "even brass bands were incorporated by private acts of the
							legislature." In the session of 1845-46 forty divorces were granted by the
							legislature. In some counties prohibitory temperance laws were in force while other
							counties had none. The new Constitution explicitly forbids special, or class,
							legislation. All laws are general, and their effect would be uniform if the conditions
							of all communities were uniform.</p>
						<p>A general law providing that all persons having claims against the State may sue it

						<p><hi rend="b">75. Peculiarities</hi>. &mdash; Nowhere is the fear of executive power,
							previously mentioned (§5), better illustrated than in the Constitution of Indiana. A
							comparison of the state executive with that of the Nation reveals striking contrasts.
							The President of the United States has power in keeping with that of an English king.
							He is the only executive officer of the federal government who is elected by the <pb
								id="VAC1016-066" n="48"/> people; other executive officials are appointed by him and
							are responsible to him. The Governor of the State is but one of many executive
							officials elected by the people. The other officials are in no sense his cabinet. They
							are almost wholly independent of him and administer their departments coördinately
							with his. While some authority over state officers is given to the Chief Executive the
							public has not grown accustomed to the exercise of it. It has been suggested that such
							a dissipation of power weakens the state executive; that if the other state officials
							were appointed by the Governor, unity of action would be secured and responsibility
							better located. On the other hand, the Governor's office carries with it certain
							privileges which hark back to the days of executive supremacy. He is "Your
							Excellency." He is subject neither to the legislature nor the Supreme Court. For a
							crime he could not be arrested. His power also has been greatly increased in the
							administrative department, and bids fair to be increased more in the future. The state
							executive shows plainly the marks of both the centralizing and the decentralizing
							influences in Indiana history.</p>

						<p>S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 11. Whenever the Lieutenant-governor shall act as Governor,

						<p>Should there be no President <hi rend="i">pro tempore</hi> of the Senate at the time
							of the removal of both Governor and Lieutenant-governor the Secretary of State is

						<p>The naval forces of the State have never been organized, but Governors have on

						<pb id="VAC1016-069" n="51"/>
						<p>The information given to the General Assembly is in the form of a message, read by

							advice.</p>
						<note type="margin">Bills signed or vetoed.</note>
						<p>S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 14. Every bill which shall have passed the General Assembly
							shall be presented to the Governor; if he approve, he shall sign it, but if not, he
							shall return it, with his objections, to the house in which it shall have originated,
							which house shall enter the objections at large upon its journals and proceed to
							reconsider the bill. If, after such reconsideration, a majority of all the members
							elected to that house shall agree to pass the bill, it shall be sent, with the
							Governor's objections, to the other house, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered,
							and if approved by a majority of all the members elected to that house, it shall be a
							law. If any bill shall not be returned by the Governor within three days, Sundays
							excepted, after it shall have been presented to him, it shall be a law without his
							signature, unless the general adjournment shall prevent its return, in which case it
							shall be a law unless the Governor, within five days next after such adjournment,
							shall file such bill, with his objections thereto, in the office of the Secretary of
							State, who shall lay the same before the General Assembly at its next session in like
							manner as if it had been returned by the Governor. But no bill shall be presented to
							the Governor within two days next previous to the final adjournment of the General
							Assembly.</p>
						<p>The vote of the General Assembly by which a bill becomes a law over the Governor's
							veto varies widely in the different States. In some States he is given no veto power:
							in others a three-fifths vote is required. In one State a two-thirds vote in the house
							in which the measure originated, and a majority vote in the other house, are

						<note type="margin">Transaction of Business.</note>

						<note type="margin">Pardoning Power.</note>
						<p>S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 17. He shall have the power to grant reprieves, commutations
							and pardons, after conviction, for all offenses except treason and cases of

							for treason, he shall have power to suspend the execution of the sentence until the
							case shall be reported to the General Assembly at its next meeting, when the General
							Assembly shall either grant a pardon, commute the sentence, direct the execution of
							the sentence, or grant a further reprieve. He shall have power to remit fines and
							forfeitures, under such regulations as may be prescribed by law, and shall report to
							the General Assembly, at its next meeting, each case of reprieve, commutation, or
							pardon granted, and also the names of all persons in whose favor remission of fines
							and forfeitures shall have been made, and the several amounts remitted: Provided,
							however, That the General Assembly may, by law, constitute a council, to be composed
							of officers of State, without whose advice and consent the Governor shall not have
							power to grant pardons, in any case, except such as may, by law, be left to his sole
							power.</p>
						<p>The Governor exercises the clemency of the State toward condemned persons. A Board of
							Pardons advises him, but he may act independently. A reprieve delays the execution of
							a sentence; a commutation substitutes a lighter penalty; and a pardon extends complete
							freedom.</p>

						<p><hi rend="b">90. The Treasurer of State</hi>. &mdash; The Treasurer is the keeper of

							sum of $700,000, with twenty or more good sureties. He can receive no money except
							through a draft from the Auditor of State, and he must deposit, not loan, the money

						<p><hi rend="b">91. The Attorney-General</hi>. &mdash; The office of Attorney-General

						<p><hi rend="b">92. Superintendent of Public Instruction</hi>. &mdash; The duties of
							this officer involve the general supervision of school work in the State. He is <hi

						<p><hi rend="b">93. The State Geologist</hi>. &mdash; The law demands that the State

						<p><hi rend="b">94. The State Statistician</hi>. &mdash; The office of the State
							Statistician was established in 1879. Its purpose is to collect and present to the

						<p><hi rend="b">107. The Supreme Court</hi>. &mdash; S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 2. The

						<p>S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 4. The Supreme Court shall have jurisdiction, coextensive

						<p>S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 5. The Supreme Court shall, upon the decision of every case,
							give a statement in writing of each question arising in the record of such case, and

						<p>S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 6. The General Assembly shall provide by law for the speedy

						<p>S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 7. There shall be elected by the voters of the State, a Clerk
							of the Supreme Court, who shall hold his office four years, and whose duties shall be
							prescribed by law.</p>
						<p>The Supreme Court is composed of five judges, each serving in succession as Chief
							Justice. Two terms of court <pb id="VAC1016-084" n="64"/> are held each year,
							beginning on the fourth Mondays of May and November. The purpose of the Court is not
							to try original cases, but to review the law and evidence of cases first tried in the
							lower courts. It may affirm, amend, or reverse the decision of a lower court. The
							judgment of the Court is that of a majority of the judges, and is final unless it
							involves the Constitution or Laws of the United States.</p>
						<note type="margin">The Appellate Court.</note>
						<p>The Appellate Court, consisting of six judges elected for a term of six years,
							relieves the Supreme Court of some of its burdens. The Court sits in two divisions of
							three judges each, thus doing the business of two separate courts. Certain cases may
							be transferred or appealed from it to the Supreme Court.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">108. Circuit Courts</hi>. &mdash; S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 8. The Circuit

						<p>S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 10. The General Assembly may provide, by law, that the judge

							convenience; and in case of temporary inability of any judge, from sickness or other
							cause, to hold the courts in his circuit, provisions may be made, by law, for holding
							such courts.</p>
						<p>At present there are sixty-two districts, designated by number, in the State. Four
							terms of court are usually held in each district annually, the length of term
							depending on the number of counties in the district and the amount of business to be
							adjusted. Circuit Courts have original jurisdiction in all civil and criminal cases,
							except minor actions assigned by law to Justices of the Peace. They have <pb
								id="VAC1016-085" n="65"/> appellate jurisdiction in all cases appealed from City
							Courts, Commissioners' Courts, or Justices of the Peace. They also have authority in
							all cases of adjudication not provided for by statute. Power is given the Courts for
							the enforcement of their own decrees.</p>
						<note type="margin">Superior Courts.</note>
						<note type="margin">A Court of Claims.</note>
						<p>In the more densely populated counties it has become necessary to provide extra

							is termed the Superior Court. In nearly all respects the Superior Courts are like
							Circuit Courts; but that of Marion County is also made a Court of Claims, wherein
							suits may be brought against the State. When such claim is found to be valid the
							appropriation for its satisfaction may be made by the General Assembly only.</p>
						<note type="margin">Criminal Courts.</note>
						<note type="margin">Juvenile Courts.</note>
						<p>In the more populous cities, Criminal Courts, having general jurisdiction over all

							and the judge of the Circuit Court in smaller ones, have charge of delinquent boys and
							girls under the ages of sixteen and seventeen respectively.</p>
						<note type="margin">Mayors', City, and Police Courts.</note>
						<p>The Mayors of cities may hold Courts having jurisdiction in minor civil and criminal

							cities Police Courts serve the purposes of both.</p>

						<p>The annual salary of the judges of the Supreme Court is $6000. Judges of Circuit

						<p>Each township is entitled to one Justice of the Peace, and at the discretion of the

						<p>The Grand Jury consists of six substantial citizens, who shall "diligently inquire

							parties unless they voluntarily submit their matters of difference and agree to abide
							the judgment of such tribunal or court.</p>
						<p>S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 20. The General Assembly, at its first session after the
							adoption of this constitution, shall provide for the appointment of three
							commissioners, whose duty it shall be to revise, simplify and abridge the rules,
							practice, pleadings and forms of the courts of justice. And they shall provide for
							abolishing the distinct forms of action at law now in use; and that justice shall be
							administered in a uniform mode of pleading, without distinction between law and
							equity. And the General Assembly may, also, make it the duty of said commissioners to
							reduce into a systematic code the general statute law of the State; and said
							commissioners shall report the result of their labors to the General Assembly, with
							such recommendations and suggestions, as to the abridgment and amendment, as to said

						<note type="margin">The Congressional Township Fund.</note>
						<p>By the Constitution the Common School Fund is a consolidation of the Congressional
							Township Fund and all other funds. By statute the Congressional Township Fund is
							separated from the remaining funds, which are known as the Common School Funds. The
							former has been derived from the sale of congressional township school lands, given to
							the State for that purpose at the time of its admission to the Union. This fund,
							exclusive of over one <pb id="VAC1016-092" n="70"/> thousand acres yet unsold, amounts
							to $2,500,000. (See Section 6 of Enabling Act, Appendix.)</p>
						<note type="margin">The Surplus Revenue Fund.</note>
						<p>The Surplus Revenue Fund is Indiana's portion ($860,254) of the United States revenue
							distributed among the States in 1836. This is virtually a loan and must be returned to
							the federal government if called for.</p>
						<note type="margin">Saline Fund.</note>
						<p>The Saline Fund (about $85,000) arose from the sale of salt springs and lands as

						<note type="margin">Bank Tax Fund.</note>
						<p>It was provided in 1834 that all shares of the State Bank not owned by the State
							should pay an annual tax of 12½ cents, to be given to the School Fund. The amount thus
							secured was $80,000.</p>
						<note type="margin">The Sinking Fund.</note>
						<p>The Sinking Fund is a balance left the State after its participation in the ownership
							of stock in the State Bank. From it the School Fund secured $ 4,255,731.</p>
						<note type="margin">Seminary Fund.</note>
						<p>By provision of the Constitution of 1816 county seminaries were established and
							supported by public money. With the adoption of the present Constitution and the
							reorganization of the school system the seminaries were sold and the proceeds, over
							$100,000, were turned over to the State. The additional funds, derived from other
							sources as provided, make a Common School Fund which, exclusive of the Congressional
							Township Fund, amounts to about $8,300,000.</p>
						<note type="margin">School Taxes.</note>
						<note type="margin">Annual Amount.</note>
						<note type="margin">Apportionment.</note>
						<p>The State levies a tax of 50 cents on every taxable person, and 13.6 cents on every
							$100 worth of taxable property, for school purposes. Local communities also assess a
							tax for tuition and another for special school purposes, the former to be used
							exclusively in the payment of teachers and the latter for school supplies of all
							kinds. The revenues thus secured, together with the interest on the perpetual fund,
							and returns from liquor licenses, unclaimed witness fees, and fines, amount to
							$11,000,000 annually. The state revenues are <pb id="VAC1016-093" n="71"/> apportioned

						<p>The educational progress of the State of Indiana may be read in the work of its

							development of the public school system; but the initiative, the organization, and
							direction of forces have fallen to the lot of the Superintendents of Public

							by the following steps: a conservation of school funds; better buildings and
							equipment; compulsory education for children between the ages of seven and fourteen; a
							minimum school term; a minimum wage law; consolidation of schools, and the development
							of a public school spirit not measured in terms of words.</p>

							It shall be the duty of the General Assembly to provide by law for the support of

							the treatment of the insane.</p>
						<p>Schools for the deaf and dumb and the blind are not charitable institutions but a
							part of the educational system of the State.</p>
						<p>An institution for the blind was established in Indianapolis as early as 1847. A
							school for the deaf and dumb is located in the same city. A certificate from a Justice
							of the Peace secures admission to either of these schools, in which considerate
							treatment and excellent instruction are given. A school for feeble-minded youth is
							located near Fort Wayne. The State provides five hospitals for the insane (§10). An
							oath before a Justice of the Peace declaring insanity, followed by an examination, and
							an order from <pb id="VAC1016-095" n="73"/> the County Clerk, are the steps by which
							an unfortunate is placed in one of these institutions. Unfortunately, a person
							pronounced incurable in either of the insane hospitals may be returned to the county

							may send him to this correctional institution, to be transferred to the Men's
							Reformatory at the age of seventeen if still incorrigible, or to be paroled on good
							behavior. A similar School for Incorrigible Girls under the age of seventeen is
							located near Indianapolis. In 1897 the prison at Jeffersonville became a reformatory,
							where, under indeterminate sentences, are confined all "male prisoners found guilty of
							a felony other than treason or murder in the first or second degree, and who are more

						<p>The County Poor Farm, or asylum, is the guarantee against starvation which the State
							makes to all its citizens, however unfortunate or degraded they may have become.
							Township trustees alone have authority to remove unfortunates to the Poor Farm. The
							able-bodied inmates are required to work, and since 1897 children have not been

							taxation of all property, both real and personal, excepting such only for municipal,
							educational, literary, scientific, religious or charitable purposes, as may be
							specially exempted by law.</p>
						<p>The right to tax its citizens is one of the highest prerogatives of any government,
							and can be justified only when the public is aided by the taxation. Indiana as a State
							engages in no industry from which it may derive an income. Its expenses, therefore,
							must be met by those who receive its benefits and enjoy its protection. To meet the
							expenses of the State, as estimated by its Auditor, the General Assembly requires that
							a certain number of cents on every hundred dollars' worth of taxable property be paid
							into the State Treasury. It also assesses a nominal sum, known as a poll-tax, on all
							voters under fifty years of age. The State exempts the following property from
							taxation: school and church property; property of the United States; property of any
							county, township, town or city; property or endowments for charitable purposes;
							cemeteries; bonds of state or municipal corporations.</p>
						<p>In addition to the tax levied by the State another may be levied by the County,

						<p>S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 6. No county shall subscribe for stock in any incorporated

						<p>S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 7. No law or resolution shall ever be passed by the General

							pay or redeem any certificate of stock issued in pursuance of an act entitled "An act

							Wabash and Erie Canal to Evansville," passed January 19, 1846, and an act supplemental
							to said act, passed January 29, 1847, which by the provisions of the said acts, or
							either of them, shall be payable exclusively from the proceeds of the canal lands, and
							the tolls and revenues of the canal in said acts mentioned; and no such certificates
							of stocks shall ever be paid by this State.</p>

						<p>Provision is made that the revenues of the State be used to pay, first the current
							expenses, then the interest on the state debt, and finally the principal of the state
							debt. In 1836 the State appropriated over ten million dollars for the building of
							canals and roads (§29). Poor management of these internal improvements, together with
							the panic of 1837, injured the credit of the State and nearly bankrupted its treasury.
							Its public works were abandoned or transferred to private corporations. The loss to
							the State was about eight million dollars. The more recent management of state
							finances has been highly creditable and the once heavy debt is practically
							extinguished.</p>

						<p>The State owned half the stock and participated in the management of a bank,
							chartered in 1834 and continued until 1857. The career of this bank was honorable and
							profitable to the State. Inspection of the institution was <pb id="VAC1016-100" n="78"

							banks, insurance companies, and other corporations of similar character has grown
							until the pecuniary interests of the people are guarded with care. The present system
							of taxing corporations involves two principles, stated as follows: All property,
							tangible or intangible, must be assessed and taxed at its true cash value, and all
							corporate property, including capital stock and franchises, except when other
							provision is made by law, is to be assessed to the corporation as to an individual
							person, at the place of its principal office in the State.</p>

						<hi rend="sc">LOCAL GOVERNMENT</hi></head>
					<p><hi rend="b">135. Types of Local Government</hi>. &mdash; There are three types of
						rural local government in the United States. The Town or Township is the unit of the
						first type, best represented in New England; the County is the unit of the second type,
						prevalent in the Southern States; the third is a combination of the town and county
						types, and is found in Indiana and other States along the fortieth parallel and in the
						Northwest. In Indiana the County is relatively less important than in the Southern
						States and the Township relatively less important than in New England. The Townships are
						miniature republics in regard to local affairs of minor importance; they are dependent
						upon the authority of the County in the larger governmental duties. When the Township
						lacks the means of providing its own needs the County exercises authority by taxing its
						entire self for the benefit of the weaker members. The importance of this power should
						be noted. It is sometimes exercised by the State for the benefit of the poorer Counties,
						as in extending school terms. Only the fear of centralization and the dislike of the
						richer localities to tax themselves for the poorer oppose it. The political training
						which comes from the attempt to make every locality sovereign to its own wants is not
						trivial.</p>

						<p><hi rend="b">136. The Organization of Counties</hi>. &mdash; When civil government
							was inaugurated in the Northwest Territory the Governors proceeded to lay out
							Counties, fix the county seats, appoint officers, and define their powers. The
							successive Governors continued to exercise this authority until it was assumed by the
							legislature, after the territory had passed to the second stage of government. The
							first County formed was Knox, in 1790, embracing all of Indiana and parts of Michigan
							and Illinois. The subdivision of this one County began in the southern part of the
							State, extending northward until ninety-two Counties were formed, the last being
							Newton in 1859. In Indiana as well as in the New England States the immediate reason
							for the organization of Counties was that judicial power might be extended over the
							territory. The administration of civil government was at first centralized in the
							Courts. The Courts regulated the county revenues and appointed the county officers.
							Later this administrative power was transferred to county officers elected by the
							people.</p>
						<note type="margin">State ex rel. <hi rend="i">vs</hi>. Clark, 4 Indiana, 316.</note>
						<p><hi rend="b">137. The County Commissioners</hi>. &mdash; Three substantial citizens,
							voters and freeholders, elected by the voters of the entire County, but each
							representing one of the three districts into which the County is divided, compose the
							Board of County Commissioners. Each Commissioner serves for a term of three years, not
							more than two being elected at the same time. In law this board is the County. It
							constitutes a court having judicial and legislative authority in the transaction of
							county business. It controls all county property; makes public improvements; grants
							liquor licenses; exacts reports from county and township officers; and exercises
							general supervision of county affairs. The <pb id="VAC1016-117" n="91"/> wisdom and
							integrity of this Board are of supreme importance to the citizens of the County.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">138. The County Council</hi>. &mdash; The possible abuse of excessive
							power in the hands of the County Commissioners led to the creation of a County
							Council. This body is composed of seven members, four elected from districts and three
							elected at large, each serving four years. County and township officers are required
							to present the Council with estimates of the expenses of their respective departments
							for the ensuing year. The Council may reduce any or all of these estimates. No county
							officer can bind the County to an agreement beyond the appropriation made by this
							Council for a specific purpose.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">139. The County Auditor</hi>. &mdash; The Auditor is elected for a term
							of four years, and cannot hold more than two terms in succession. He is the County's
							bookkeeper. He is Clerk of the Commissioner's Court and of the County Council. No
							claim against the County is paid without his warrant. Upon the rates fixed he
							apportions taxes on all property in the County. He also apportions the school revenues
							to the several school corporations in the County.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">140. The County Treasurer</hi>. &mdash; The Treasurer is elected for two
							years, and cannot serve more than two terms in succession. He collects all taxes due
							the State, County, and Township, and turns over to each its share.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">141. The County Clerk</hi>. &mdash; The Clerk of the County is also
							Clerk of the Circuit Court. In addition to his duties in Court he attends to the
							clerical work of the County. He receives the bonds of other county officers; issues
							all licenses except teacher's license and liquor license, and, when Court is not in
							session, letters of administration and letters testamentary. He is elected for a term
							of four years, and may not be elected more than twice in succession.</p>
						<pb id="VAC1016-118" n="92"/>
						<p><hi rend="b">142. The County Recorder</hi>. &mdash; This officer is elected for a
							term of four years, and cannot serve more than two terms in succession. In his keeping
							are all records of deeds, mortgages, and certificates of incorporation. These are
							properly recorded in books and carefully indexed for the convenience of the
							public.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">143. The Sheriff</hi>. &mdash; The Sheriff is elected for two years, and
							may serve twice in succession. He is the chief executive officer of the County. He
							serves the Court, maintains peace, and has charge of prisoners. Citizens called upon
							by him must assist in the preservation of peace. In case of riot or insurrection he
							may call upon the Governor for the aid of the militia; the Governor may call for
							federal aid. Thus in extreme disorder, as well as in peace, the protection of our
							whole complex system of government is over every citizen.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">144. The Coroner</hi>. &mdash; The Coroner is elected for a term of two
							years, and may be reëlected any number of terms. This office was originally a check
							upon the power of the Sheriff. The Coroner retains power to suppress disorder, arrest
							the Sheriff for crime, or to take his office in case of a vacancy. But his chief duty
							is to inquire into the causes of all deaths which occur through violence or
							casualty.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">145. The County Assessor</hi>. &mdash; This elective officer supervises
							the work of Township Assessors, and places on the tax lists property which may have
							been omitted by them. He is eligible for two terms of four years each in
							succession.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">146. The Surveyor</hi>. &mdash; The County Surveyor is elected for a
							term of two years, and is reëligible. He has charge of the accurate marking and
							preservation of all boundary lines outside city or town limits.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">147. The County Superintendent of Schools</hi>. &mdash; The most
							important school officer of the County, and one of the most <pb id="VAC1016-119"
								n="93"/> important in the whole system of education, is the Superintendent of
							Schools. He is elected by the Township Trustees for a term of four years, and has
							general supervision of all rural schools, visiting each one annually. He grants
							teacher's license to qualified applicants who do not send their manuscripts to the
							State Superintendent. He reports to the State Superintendent the condition of school
							affairs in his County, giving statistical information concerning the pupils of school
							age and the various school funds. An educational qualification is required of this
							officer.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">148. Jury Commissioners</hi>. &mdash; Two Commissioners, of opposite
							political faith, are appointed annually by the Judge of the Circuit Court to select
							the names of twice as many citizens as will be required to serve as grand and petit
							jurors during the year. These names are deposited in a jury box and the key intrusted
							to the Commissioner of opposite political belief from the County Clerk. The box is
							retained by the Clerk, and the names drawn by chance by him two weeks previous to the
							opening of Court.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">149. The County Attorney</hi>. &mdash; The County Commissioners annually
							appoint an Attorney whose duty it is to advise all county officers in regard to the
							legality of their actions and to defend them in any suits at law.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">150. The Board of Review</hi>. &mdash; This Board, sometimes called the
							Board of Equalization, is composed of the County Assessor, the Auditor, the Treasurer,
							and two freeholders chosen by the Judge of the Circuit Court. It equalizes the
							assessments on property throughout the County. Before it any taxpayer may present
							objections to the valuation of his property.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">151. Boards of Charity</hi>. &mdash; The Judge of the Circuit Court may
							appoint a board of six persons, one a woman, to examine and report concerning all
							charitable and correctional <pb id="VAC1016-120" n="94"/> institutions of the County.
							Another board of six persons, known as the Board of Children's Guardians, may be
							appointed to care for neglected and dependent children. A Superintendent of the County
							Poor Asylum is appointed by the County Commissioners for a term of two years. One or
							more physicians, appointed by the Commissioners, attend the poor of the County and the
							prisoners in jail. How to administer humane and just treatment to the unfortunate
							classes without encouraging dependency is one of the problems of local government.</p>

						<note type="margin">The Congressional Township.</note>
						<p><hi rend="b">152. The Organization of the Township</hi>. &mdash; The Township is the
							oldest and simplest unit of our government. When the Northwest Territory came into
							possession of the United States provision was made for the survey of the land. This
							survey divided Indiana into rectangles six miles square, known as Congressional
							Townships. The Townships were numbered, north and south of a base line crossing the
							southern part of the State, and east and west of a principal meridian which bisects
							the State lengthwise. Since these Townships were formed to aid in the description and
							sale of land no attention was given to the physical irregularities of the surface of
							the State.</p>
						<note type="margin">The Civil Township.</note>
						<p>Soon after the formation of the first counties in the State the courts were
							authorized to form townships for the purpose of aiding in the administration of county
							and state business. This unit of government is known as the civil <pb id="VAC1016-121"
								n="95"/> township, the first provision for which was made in 1790. The Civil
							Townships were not given a separate, corporate existence at once. When the power to
							form them was transferred from the Courts to the County Commissioners they were given
							some authority in elections, taxation, and the relief of the poor: now each of the one
							thousand and sixteen in the State is a corporate and political body, which may enter
							into contracts, sue and be sued.</p>
						<note type="margin">Rawle's <hi rend="i">Centralizing Tendencies in Indiana</hi>,
							22.</note>
						<note type="margin">The School Township.</note>
						<p>The provision that every sixteenth section in each Congressional Township be reserved
							for school purposes naturally made the township the unit of the school system. But the
							School Township is neither the Congressional Township nor the Civil Township. It is a
							separate corporation, which owns all school property and maintains all schools within
							the boundaries of the Civil Townships. The boundaries of the Civil and School
							Townships are always the same; but the Congressional Township, formed with no
							reference to physical environment or the convenience of the people in civic affairs,
							often has boundaries which do not coincide with those of Civil and School
							Townships.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">153. The Township Trustee</hi>. &mdash; The Township Trustee transacts
							all the business of both the Civil and the School Township. He is administrator,
							treasurer, auditor, and clerk combined in one. He attends to the financial affairs of
							the Township, giving to the public an annual report of all receipts and expenditures.
							He has supervision over road districts, boundary lines, and drains. He is inspector of
							elections, and every six years makes an enumeration of the voters of his Township. His
							hand shelters the poor in their distress. As Trustee of the School Township he employs
							teachers and cares for all school property. He is elected for a term of four years,
							but cannot succeed himself in office.</p>
						<pb id="VAC1016-122" n="96"/>
						<p><hi rend="b">154. The Township Advisory Board</hi>. &mdash; Three resident
							freeholders and voters of the Township constitute an Advisory Board, whose counterpart
							has been seen in the County Council (§138). This Board is elected for a term of four
							years and has general control of the finances of the Township. It considers
							appropriations for current expenses, and beyond its approval the Township Trustee may
							not act. It fixes the rate of taxation for township purposes and may borrow money for
							the corporation. Its creation has lessened the opportunity for extravagance in local
							administration.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">155. The Township Assessor</hi>. &mdash; The Assessor appraises personal
							property every year and real estate every four years. His term of office is four
							years.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">156. The Road Supervisor</hi>. &mdash; Each road district has over it a
							Supervisor, elected for the term of two years. It is his duty to execute the orders of
							the County Commissioners concerning highways and bridges. For this purpose he may
							require the services of all able-bodied men between the ages of twenty-one and fifty,
							from two to four days each year.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">157. Justices of the Peace and Constables</hi>. &mdash; Judicial and
							executive authority are represented in Justices of the Peace and Constables. The
							former holds the least or lowest Court known to law, and the latter serves the
							Court.</p>

						<note type="margin">Municipalities.</note>
						<p><hi rend="b">158. Classification</hi>. &mdash; It is evident that the conditions of a
							densely populated community demand a more elaborate government than that of the
							Township or County. This demand is encountered in municipalities, which, for
							convenience, may be divided into two classes. The first class has a simple government,
							and includes those corporations <pb id="VAC1016-123" n="[]"/>

							<pb id="VAC1016-125" n="97"/> known in certain States as <hi rend="i">Boroughs</hi>,
							in other States as <hi rend="i">Villages</hi>, and in Indiana as <hi rend="i"
								>Towns</hi>. The second class includes all towns which have grown into the size and
							dignity of <hi rend="i">Cities</hi>. We have only to notice the fact that nearly one
							half of the people of Indiana live in Towns and Cities to realize the importance of
							municipal government. The framers of the Constitution could not foresee the remarkable
							growth of municipalities, which explains why the only provision concerning them is a
							restriction on the indebtedness they may incur (Art. XIII).</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">159. Incorporation</hi>. &mdash; The first Town incorporated in Indiana
							was Clarksville, in 1785. A little later the borough of Vincennes was incorporated,
							while special charters were granted to several other Towns in the days of territorial
							government. These early Towns differed materially in the manner of their incorporation
							and in the extent of their powers. At present the incorporation of a Town is secured
							by the following steps: An accurate survey and map of the limits to be included are
							secured; a census of the people residing within the district is taken; a petition,
							signed by one third of the voters within the district, is presented to the County
							Commissioners; if approved, the Commissioners grant an election in which a majority of
							the voters may express their desire for incorporation; the declaration of
							incorporation is then issued by the Commissioners. The Town may be dissolved by a
							two-thirds vote of four fifths of all the voters within its limits. When incorporated,
							the Town is divided into from three to seven wards, from each of which a Trustee is
							chosen by the voters of the entire district. A Clerk and a Treasurer are also elected,
							while a Marshal, a Fire Chief, and a Street Commissioner are usually appointed by the
							Town Board of Trustees.</p>
						<pb id="VAC1016-126" n="98"/>
						<p><hi rend="b">160. The Town Trustees</hi>. &mdash; Most of the functions of town
							government are performed through the Town Trustees. The rules and regulations passed

						<p><hi rend="b">163. Organization</hi>. &mdash; Towns with fewer than two thousand
							inhabitants do not usually consider it advantageous to assume city government. When
							one third of the voters petition the Town Trustees it is determined by a majority vote
							of all electors whether or not the town will become a City. If city government is
							determined upon, the district is divided into wards, the number and boundaries of
							which may not be changed oftener than once in six years. The government of the City is
							a reduced type of state government. Its Charter, provided for by statute, corresponds
							to the Constitution; the City Council to the General Assembly; its Mayor to the
							Governor, and the City Courts to the Judicial Department of the State.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">164. Classification</hi>. &mdash; In Indiana, Cities are classified on
							the basis of population. The First Class must have a population of 100,000. The Second
							Class includes all Cities having a population of from 45,000 to 100,000; the Third
							Class, all Cities having a population of from 20,000 to 45,000; the Fourth Class, all
							Cities having a population of from 10,000 to 20,000, and the Fifth Class, all Cities
							having a population under 10,000. The chief difference in the government of Cities in
							the various classes is in the complexity of organization and administration.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">165. The Legislative Department</hi>. &mdash; The legislative power of
							the City is vested in a Common Council. One member <pb id="VAC1016-128" n="100"/> of
							the Council is elected from each ward, and from two to six members are elected at
							large. In Cities of the first and second classes the Council selects a presiding
							officer; in other Cities the Mayor presides. The Council is required to meet at least
							once each month, and may meet oftener upon the call of the Mayor, or as determined by
							agreement. The duties of the Council in each class of Cities are specifically defined
							by state laws, the differentiation of duties increasing with the size of the Cities.
							In general the Council passes laws or ordinances regulating the finances, providing
							for public improvements, public health, and safety. Except in the larger Cities, the
							Council selects a Board of three School Trustees who have charge of the educational
							interests of the city.</p>
						<note type="margin">The Common Council.</note>
						<note type="margin">School Trustees.</note>
						<note type="margin">The Mayor.</note>
						<p><hi rend="b">166. The Executive Department</hi>. &mdash; The Mayor is the chief
							executive officer of the City. He is held responsible for the order and efficiency of
							the administration of the government. It is his duty to enforce the Ordinances of the
							City and the Laws of the State. He possesses a veto power, which may be overcome by a
							two-thirds vote of the Common Council. In Cities of the fifth class he is a judicial
							as well as an executive officer.</p>
						<note type="margin">Method of making Appropriations.</note>
						<p><hi rend="b">167. Administrative Departments</hi>. &mdash; In order to relieve the
							Common Council of some of the burdens of administration, Cities of the four highest
							classes provide Departments to manage the following interests: Finance, Public Works,
							Public Safety, Public Health and Charity, Law, Assessment, and Collection. Each
							Department is presided over by an officer who, with the exception of the head of the
							last-named Department, is appointed by the Mayor. These officers submit annually, in
							joint session, an itemized statement of probable expenses of their respective
							Departments. The report is examined, and may be revised, by the <pb id="VAC1016-129"
								n="101"/> Controller. It is then referred to the Mayor, who presents it, with any
							recommendations he may have, to the Common Council. The Council may reduce but may not
							increase the estimated expenditures without the consent of the Mayor. When the
							estimations are accepted, and the tax rate fixed, the Departments may not contract
							beyond the appropriations made by the Council. Should an emergency for additional
							appropriations arise, the Council may, on the advice of the Controller, provide for
							them by a two-thirds vote.</p>
						<note type="margin">The Controller.</note>
						<p><hi rend="b">168. Department of Finance</hi>. &mdash; The Department of Finance is in
							charge of the Controller. He inspects all accounts in which the City is interested,
							grants orders for the payment of money, and issues all licenses.</p>
						<note type="margin">The City Attorney</note>
						<p><hi rend="b">169. Department of Law</hi>. &mdash; The City Attorney is appointed by
							the Mayor in all Cities except those of the fifth class, in which he is chosen by the
							Council. He is the legal adviser of city officers, the prosecutor or defender of the
							City as the occasion demands. He prepares all ordinances, contracts, leases, deeds,
							and other legal documents for the city.</p>
						<note type="margin">The Board of Public Works.</note>
						<p><hi rend="b">170. Department of Public Works</hi>. &mdash; The Department of Public
							Works consists of a Board of three members, assisted by the City Civil Engineer. This
							Board acquires and controls all property, personal and real, needed for public use. It
							supplies water and light, and provides improvements of all kinds for the city. It has
							general charge of all other executive and administrative duties not assigned to the
							other departments.</p>
						<note type="margin">The Board of Public Safety.</note>
						<p><hi rend="b">171. Department of Public Safety</hi>. &mdash; In Cities of the third
							class the duties of this department may be, and in Cities of the fourth class are,
							assumed by the Board of Public Works. The Board of Public Safety consists of three
							Commissioners appointed by the Mayor. It has <pb id="VAC1016-130" n="102"/> control of
							all matters relating to the inspection of buildings, foods, market places, fire
							escapes, and other sources of danger to the public. It appoints a Superintendent of
							Police except in Cities of from ten thousand to thirty-five thousand inhabitants,
							where a Metropolitan Police Commission of three members is appointed by the
							Governor.</p>
						<note type="margin">The City Treasurer.</note>
						<p><hi rend="b">172. Assessment and Collection Department</hi>. &mdash; The City
							Treasurer is at the head of the Department of Assessment and Collection. But in Cities
							of the first three classes the County Treasurer is <hi rend="i">ex officio</hi> City
							Treasurer. In Cities of the fourth class the County Treasurer is also City Treasurer
							if the City is a County Seat; otherwise the City has its own Treasurer. Cities of the
							fifth class have their own Treasurers, but the valuation of property is determined by
							the general assessment and the County Treasurer collects the taxes.</p>
						<note type="margin">The City Board of Health.</note>
						<p><hi rend="b">173. Department of Public Health and Charities</hi>. &mdash; This
							Department consists of a Board of three Commissioners. One member, usually known as
							the Health Officer, must be a physician who is well informed in sanitary science. The
							Board has charge of the public health of the City. It secures and enforces sanitary
							laws; controls the city hospital and dispensary; quarantines against infectious
							diseases, and collects the vital statistics of the City.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">174. The City Clerk</hi>. &mdash; The City Clerk is a ministerial
							officer, assigned various duties in the several Administrative Departments. He makes a
							record of the proceedings of the Common Council; keeps all papers and documents
							intrusted to him; and, in Cities of the fifth class, draws warrants on the City
							Treasurer for the payment of claims allowed against the City.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">175. Police Power</hi>. &mdash; Police power is one of the most
							important factors in city government.</p>
						<pb id="VAC1016-131" n="103"/>
						<q rend="blockquote"><p>In the jostling throngs of the city a careless or vicious member
								of society has a hundredfold more opportunity to disturb the comfort and endanger
								the health and well-being of his fellows than in the country.</p></q>
						<note type="margin">Shaw's <hi rend="i">Municipal Government in Europe</hi>, 7.</note>
						<p>Since the State is responsible for the protection of the life and property of all its
							citizens, police power belongs to the State. In keeping with this theory cities of
							from ten thousand to thirty-five thousand inhabitants may have Metropolitan Police
							Commissioners appointed by the Governor. Whether or not the State should extend its
							authority in seeking the peace and safety of its citizens is a question now before the
							people. The Supreme Court has declared that &mdash; <q rend="blockquote"><p>in
									providing for the appointment of officers connected with the constabulary of the
									State, there is not an invasion of the right of local self-government.</p></q></p>
						<p><hi rend="b">176. Judicial Power</hi>. &mdash; Judicial power in Cities of the fifth
							class is vested in the Mayor. In Cities of all other classes it is vested in a City
							Court, presided over by a Judge. The City Clerk acts as Clerk of the Court in Cities
							of the first and second classes; in all other Cities the presiding officer is also
							Clerk of the Court. In Cities of the fifth class a Marshal, and in all others a
							Bailiff, executes the orders of the Court. The authority of a City Court extends to
							the violation of city ordinances, petit larceny, and to misdemeanors for which the
							penalty cannot exceed a fine of five hundred dollars and a jail sentence of six
							months. The County Prosecutor presents violations of state laws, and the City Attorney
							violations of city ordinances, before the City Court.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">177. Problems of City Government</hi>. &mdash; The problems of
							government in Indiana are becoming the problems of city government. Already one third
							of the people live in Cities, and despite the improvements which make rural life <pb
								id="VAC1016-132" n="104"/> attractive, the drift of population continues toward the
							Cities. With the crowding together of people within narrow limits new industrial and
							social problems arise. Business life in the City is remarkable for its activity and
							for the large sums of money involved in its transactions. Opportunities for plunder as
							well as philanthropy increase. Evidently government must adapt itself both in
							organization and execution to these new conditions, and we may not expect to avoid
							many perplexing problems. City governments have found it necessary to do many things
							which would have amazed our forefathers. How far shall these municipal functions be
							extended? Shall the City own all those public interests which tend to become
							monopolies? Under what conditions shall franchises be granted? How can party politics
							be eliminated from local problems having no political significance? How may
							opportunities for graft be diminished? These and many other problems call for the
							highest intelligence and honesty of citizenship. City officials should be chosen with
							reference to their fitness for the public service to be rendered. The best citizens
							may not always be induced to accept office, but they are always under obligation to
							sacrifice personal ease, business, or self-pride, if necessary, to secure the
							nomination and election of efficient officers. Municipal government as well as state
							or national government is "of the people, by the people, and for the people."</p>

						13, 1787.</p>
					<p rend="center i">"An Ordinance for the Government of the Territory of the United States
						Northwest of the River Ohio"</p>
					<p>After providing for the temporary government of such territory as one district, with a
						Governor, Legislative Council and House of Representatives of five members each,
						Secretary and Judges, all appointed by Congress, the ordinance proceeds as
						follows:&mdash;</p>
					<p>And for extending the fundamental principles of civil and religious liberty, which form
						the basis whereon these republics, their laws, and Constitutions, are erected; to fix
						and establish those principles as the basis of all laws, Constitutions, and governments,
						which forever hereafter shall be formed in the said territory; to provide, also, for the
						establishment of States, and permanent government therein, and for their admission to a
						share in the federal councils on an equal footing with the original States, at as early
						periods as may be consistent with the general interest:&mdash;</p>
					<p>It is hereby ordained and declared, by the authority aforesaid, That the following
						articles shall be considered as articles of compact between the original States and the
						people and States in the said territory, and forever remain unalterable, unless by
						common consent, to wit:&mdash;</p>
					<p>A<hi rend="sc">RT</hi>. 1. No person, demeaning himself in a peaceable and orderly
						manner, shall ever be molested on account of his mode of worship or religious
						sentiments, in the said territory.</p>
					<p>A<hi rend="sc">RT</hi>. 2. The inhabitants of the said territory shall always be
						entitled to the benefits of the writ of habeas corpus, and of the trial by jury; of a
						proportionate representation of the people in the legislature, and of judicial
						proceedings according to the course <pb id="VAC1016-136" n="108"/> of the common law.
						All persons shall be bailable, unless for capital offenses, where the proof shall be
						evident, or the presumption great. All fines shall be moderate; and no cruel or unusual
						punishments shall be inflicted. No man shall be deprived of his liberty or property, but
						by the judgment of his peers, or the law of the land, and should the public exigencies
						make it necessary, for the common preservation, to take any man's property, or to demand
						his particular services, full compensation shall be made for the same. And, in the just
						preservation of rights and property, it is understood and declared, that no law ought
						ever to be made, or have force in the said territory, that shall, in any manner
						whatever, interfere with, or affect, private contracts or engagements, bona fide, and
						without fraud, previously formed.</p>
					<p>A<hi rend="sc">RT</hi>. 3. Religion, morality, and knowledge, being necessary to good
						government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall
						forever be encouraged. The utmost good faith shall always be observed towards the
						Indians; their lands and property shall never be taken from them without their consent;
						and in their property, rights, and liberty, they never shall be invaded or disturbed
						unless in just and lawful wars authorized by Congress; but laws founded in justice and
						humanity shall from time to time be made, for preventing wrongs being done to them, and
						for preserving peace and friendship with them.</p>
					<p>A<hi rend="sc">RT</hi>. 4. That said territory, and the States which may be formed
						therein, shall forever remain a part of this confederacy of the United States of
						America, subject to the articles of confederation, and to such alterations therein as
						may be constitutionally made; and to all the acts and ordinances of the United States in
						Congress assembled, conformable thereto. The inhabitants and settlers in the said
						territory shall be subject to pay a part of the federal debts, contracted or to be
						contracted, and a proportional part of the expenses of government, to be apportioned on
						them by Congress; according to the same common rule and measure by which apportionments
						thereof shall be made on the other States; and the taxes for paying their proportion,
						shall be laid and levied by the authority and direction of the legislature of the
						district or districts, or new States, as in the original States, within the time agreed
						upon by the United States in Congress assembled. The legislatures of those districts, or
						new States, shall never interfere with the primary disposal of the soil of the United
						States in Congress assembled, nor with any <pb id="VAC1016-137" n="109"/> regulations
						Congress may find necessary, for securing the title in such soil, to the bona fide
						purchasers. No tax shall be imposed on lands the property of the United States; and in
						no case shall non-resident proprietors be taxed higher than residents. The navigable
						waters leading into the Mississippi or St. Lawrence, and the carrying places between the
						same, shall be common highways, and forever free, as well to the inhabitants of the said
						territory, as to the citizens of the United States, and those of any other States that
						may be admitted into the confederacy, without any tax, impost, or duty therefor.</p>
					<p>A<hi rend="sc">RT</hi>. 5. There shall be formed in the said territory, not less than
						three, nor more than five States; and the boundaries of the States, as soon as Virginia
						shall alter her act of cession, and consent to the same, shall become fixed and
						established as follows, to wit: The Western State in the said territory shall be bounded
						by the Mississippi, the Ohio, and Wabash rivers; a direct line drawn from the Wabash and
						Post Vincents, due north, to the territorial line between the United States and Canada;
						and by the said territorial line to the Lake of the Woods and Mississippi. The Middle
						State shall be bounded by the said direct line, the Wabash, from Post Vincents to the
						Ohio, by the Ohio, by a direct line drawn due north from the mouth of the Great Miami to
						the said territorial line. The Eastern State shall be bounded by the last-mentioned
						direct line, the Ohio, Pennsylvania, and the said territorial line: provided, however,
						and it is further understood and declared, that the boundaries of these three States
						shall be subject so far to be altered, that, if Congress shall hereafter find it
						expedient, they shall have authority to form one or two States in that part of the said
						territory, which lies north of an east and west line drawn through the southerly bend or
						extreme of Lake Michigan. And whenever any of the said States shall have sixty thousand
						free inhabitants therein, such State shall be admitted, by its delegates, into the
						Congress of the United States on an equal footing with the original States, in all
						respects whatever; and shall be at liberty to form a permanent constitution and state
						government; provided the constitution and government, so to be formed, shall be
						republican, and in conformity to the principles contained in these articles; and, so far
						as it can be consistent with the general interest of the confederacy, such admission
						shall be allowed at an earlier period, and when there may be a less number of free
						inhabitants in the State than sixty thousand.</p>
					<pb id="VAC1016-138" n="110"/>
					<p>A<hi rend="sc">RT</hi>. 6. There shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in
						said territory, otherwise than in the punishment of crimes, whereof the party shall have
						been duly convicted; provided always, that any person escaping into the same, from whom
						labor or service is lawfully claimed in any one of the original States, such fugitive
						may be lawfully reclaimed, and conveyed to the person claiming his or her labor or
						service as aforesaid.</p>

				<head rend="center">THE AMERICAN FEDERAL STATE</head>
				<p>A Text-book in Civics for High Schools and Colleges. By R<hi rend="sc">OSCOE</hi> L<hi
						rend="sc">EWIS</hi> A<hi rend="sc">SHLEY</hi>. Crown 8vo. Cloth. xlv + 599 pages. $2.00
						<hi rend="i">net</hi>.</p>
				<p>This book is particularly well suited to those advanced classes which combine their
					course in civics with that in American history. It is intended not only to describe the
					organization and work of the different American governments, but also to make prominent
					the relations of the citizens to the government and to one another. Technical descriptions
					of governmental machinery are subordinated to practical accounts of what the governments
					do and how they do it, and methods of administration are given less space than the
					purposes which administrative measures have sought to obtain. In the historical portions,
					no attempt has been made to touch upon more than the salient events, each of which is
					considered only for the light it throws upon the development of the United States. If
					desired, only the portions of the book devoted to government may be used. Useful
					bibliographies, sets of references for topics for essays, and comparative tables for more
					extended study of the different state constitutions are furnished.</p>

					Illustrated. 12mo. Cloth. ix + 252 pages. 70 cents <hi rend="i">net</hi>.</p>
				<p>The purpose of this book, for grammar school classes, is to describe those activities of
					our government which will be of especial value and interest to youthful citizens.
					Accordingly, unnecessary comments on constitutions and descriptions of the machinery of
					government have been omitted. The text is arranged for recitation by topics. Two sets of
					questions, one on the text, and the other supplementary ones, are given. The book has many
					attractive and helpful illustrations.</p>

				<head rend="center">AMERICAN HISTORY</head>
				<p>For Use in Secondary Schools. By R<hi rend="sc">OSCOE</hi> L<hi rend="sc">EWIS</hi> A<hi
						rend="sc">SHLEY</hi>. With Numerous Maps, Diagrams, and Illustrations. 12mo. 557 pages.
					Half leather. $1.40 <hi rend="i">net</hi>.</p>
				<p>This text-book on the history of the United States represents the results of class-room
					work by an experienced high school teacher. Probably the most distinctive feature of the
					book is the large number of <hi rend="i">Specific References</hi>. With few exceptions
					these are placed in the margin of the text, where they will be found most convenient for
					use in collateral reading or for reports. Numerous <hi rend="i">Topics</hi> are suggested
					with definite references. Under the head of <hi rend="i">Studies</hi> references are given
					to material that is especially interesting or unusual.</p>
				<p>Other noteworthy features are:</p>
				<p>The <hi rend="i">emphasis placed on recent events</hi>. One-fourth of the entire book is
					devoted to the period since the Civil War. It is believed that this feature of the work
					will especially commend it to progressive teachers. Although the narrative is in the main
					a continuous story of American development, chiefly from the political standpoint, due
					attention is paid to <hi rend="i">social or economic changes or conditions</hi> which have
					influenced the growth of the nation. Three entire chapters and portions of several others
					are devoted to the treatment of these subjects. Valuable <hi rend="i">Summaries</hi>,
					occupying several pages each, occur frequently. Among them are accounts of the colonial
					system of Great Britain before 1763 and of the national changes which took place during
					the Civil War and the Reconstruction periods. Especial care has been taken to make the <hi
						rend="i">maps an integral part of the book</hi>. The numerous <hi rend="i">diagrams</hi>
					and <hi rend="i">illustrations</hi> are helpful as well as attractive.</p>
