            In 1993 America's highest-grossing concert act popularized a song entitled "Dire
                        Wolf,"1 and a leading children's television series was
                    using dire wolves as bad guys.2 Elsewhere, players of Dungeons and Dragons
                    empathized with the species. Although these modern-day dire wolves are mythical and fantastic, a few
                    millennia ago real ones roamed both American continents.3 They hunted other
                    animals, slew them with their powerful jaws, and ate them. In 1854 Francis A. Linck of 
                        Evansville
                    , Indiana, found a fossilized jawbone of what was later identified as the first known
                    dire wolf and thus established a new species. Tracing the movement of this fossil from 
                        Evansville
                     to 
                        New Harmony
                    , Indiana, then to 
                        Philadelphia
                     opens up an interesting view of the study of geology in the mid-nineteenth-century
                    Middle West and of two geologists living in 
                        New Harmony
                     in 1854: David Dale Owen and Joseph Granville Norwood.
            Although the story of Francis A. Linck and his discovery can be viewed as a kind of introductory note
                    to the Owen-Norwood account, it is in itself a fascinating tale. Linck's father, also
                    Francis, was a native of Wurttemburg, 
                        Germany
                    , who migrated to 
                        Vanderburgh

                     3 Dire wolf remains have been found in Alberta, 
                                Canada
                            , and northern Peru and across the 
                                United States
                             from 
                                California
                             to

                            . A detailed discussion of dire wolves and their geographical distribution is
                            given in Ronald M. Nowak, North American Quaternary Canis (University of

                        Tennessee
                     around the time that construction began on the 
                        Wabash
                     and Erie Canal. By the fall of 1836 Francis Linck had purchased and was operating the
                    brick Mansion House hotel, "a rambling structure located a short distance from the
                        Ohio River" at First and Locust streets in 
                        Evansville
                    .4 Situated in the far southwestern corner of Indiana, 
                        Evansville
                     had approximately 1,228 residents in 1836, 2,121 in 1840, and 3,235 by 1850.5 The Linck family, along with the town, prospered. The 1850 manuscript federal
                    census for 
                        Vanderburgh County
                     lists Francis Linck, seventy-five, as a merchant in Pigeon Township with real estate
                    worth $14,400. Francis A. Linck, twenty-nine, was married and resided in Knight
                        Township.6
            
            Other than that they were probably among the first Catholic families in 
                        Evansville
                    ,7 little more is known about the Lincks. The Mansion House was torn
                    down to make way for a 1,000-seat Opera House that opened in 1868, and portions of the property
                    remained in the Linck family until 1882.8 Francis A. Linck held a seat on the 
                        Evansville City
                     Council beginning in April, 1853, was apparently an "enthusiastic
                    collector" of geological specimens, discovered the jawbone of the dire wolf probably in the
                    late summer of 1854, and died on August 28 of that same year. His will describes the property he
                    owned, mentions seven other Lincks, and states, "I further give and bequeath to my dear
                    wife Elizabeth Linck … my cabinet of Shells and curiosities …."9
            
            The story of Linck's collection continues in a series of letters written in 1854 and 1855
                    from Dr. Joseph Granville Norwood, then state geologist of 
                        Illinois
                    , to Dr. Joseph Leidy, curator of the Academy of Natural Sciences of 
                        Philadelphia
                    .10 On August 12, 1854, Norwood, who at the time resided in 
                        New Harmony
                    , wrote Leidy:

                        Enclosed you will find drawings of a bone found a short time since in the bank of the 
                                        Ohio
                                    , near the mouth of Pigeon Creek, a short distance below 
                                        Evansville
                                    , Indiana. It is from a locality where several bones of a Megalonyx were
                                    obtained some years ago—and in the same geological position. Other
                                    remains have been found associated with them, which I hope to obtain next week. The
                                    gentleman who found them, Mr. Francis A. Linck, would not part with them, but will
                                    allow drawings to be made. He has also promised me to continue his researches during
                                    the present very favorable state of the river, which is very low. If he cannot be
                                    prevailed on to send them to you, I will have as good drawings made of them as
                                    possible, and forward them. The drawings of the portion of jaw now sent, are by Mr.
                                    John Chappellsmith, a gentleman who executed many of the illustrations in Dr.
                                    Owen's Report. On the receipt of this, write and tell us what it is. Mr.
                                    Linck is anxious to know, and a word will sometimes do much toward stimulating a
                                    person to further research …."
                     
                  
               
            
            Almost three weeks later, on August 31, Norwood informed Leidy of Linck's death and
                    commented, "This is a matter to be regretted not only on account of his family, but also in
                    regard to the branch of science to which you devote yourself; so far at least as the labors of an
                    enthusiastic collector are concerned." It also at least temporarily prevented Norwood from
                    sending to Leidy a box of bones that Linck had earlier deposited with him. The bones were
                    "of great interest" even though they did not include the jawbone of the still
                    unidentified dire wolf, which fragment Linck had refused to release. "With regard to the
                    drawing sent," Norwood instructed, "if you cannot make any thing of it, let the
                    matter rest until I can see his father. Perhaps he will allow all the bones [presumably including
                    the jawbone fragment] to be sent to you."
            Subsequent correspondence indicates that Norwood continued to negotiate with the Linck family
                    concerning the "fossil bones." The geologist asked to be allowed to keep them for
                    a longer period of time and to have returned to him the fragment of the jawbone, which was back in
                    the family's possession.12 In a letter dated November 1, 1854, Norwood
                    wrote of a box forwarded to Leidy "on Tuesday last." Among other items the box
                    contained "the bones collected by Mr. Lincke, including the fragment of a jaw, of which I

                            of 
                                Philadelphia

                     sent you a drawing sometime since; Mr. Lincke's brother
                    having sent it to me since I wrote you last. I have sent the bones without his knowledge, and hope,
                    when you have done with them, that you will return them to my address…."
            Other letters in the Norwood-Leidy correspondence further imply that the wolf jawbone was of
                    exceptional interest in comparison to the other bones and shells in Linck's collection.
                    Norwood had been "gratified to hear that the box of bones belonging to Mr. Lincke contained
                    something new," he told Leidy in a letter of November 27, 1854. On February 12, 1855, he
                    confirmed, "The box with the fossil bones of Mr. Lincke, after a tedious transit, came to
                    hand safely; and the bones have been returned to Mr. Lincke's brother. I am truly glad you
                    found something new among them…. I shall be glad to receive your paper on the new wolf—with a copy for Mr. Lincke's relatives. Keep the wolf jaw
                    until I am receiving a box from Phila., of which I will give you notice." As the letter
                    indicates, the wolf bone was the only specimen not returned to Norwood and the Lincks at this time.
                    On April 17, 1855, Norwood informed Leidy that he would soon be moving from 
                        New Harmony
                     to 
                  Springfield, Illinois
               , a fact that may help to explain why the fossil of
                    the 
                        Evansville
                     dire wolf never was returned. It is still in 
                        Philadelphia
                    .
            Leidy's article announcing the new species of wolf appeared in the Proceedings
                        of the Academy of Natural Sciences of 
                            Philadelphia
                        
                in November, 1854, and opened with the sentence, "Through the
                    kindness of my friend, Dr. J. G. Norwood, of 
                        New Harmony
                    , Indiana, I have had the opportunity of examining a collection of fossil bones, which
                    were obtained by Mr. Francis A. Lincke, from the banks of the Ohio River, near
                    the mouth of Pigeon Creek, a short distance below 
                        Evansville
                    , Indiana."13 The article further revealed that Linck had
                    discovered not only the first dire wolf specimen but also, some years earlier, bones of a Megalonyx, a huge extinct mammal commonly known as Jefferson's ground sloth.14.

                        wolf," or more properly Canus dirus was not assigned until another of
                        Leidy's articles in 1858. For details see Nowak, North American Quaternary

                  14 The genus name Megalonyx, meaning Great Claw, was
                        given by Thomas Jefferson. "Two papers on this animal, read before the American
                        Philosophical Society in 1797 [one by Jefferson], were the beginning of vertebrate palaeontology
                        in America…. In proposing the generic term Mr. Jefferson did not suggest any name for
                        the species and this omission was not corrected until 1822, when the French naturalist,
                        Desmarest, gave it the very appropriate term of M. jeffersoni."

            Other collectors had also found Megalonyx bones at various places along the
                        Ohio River, some near Canoe Creek on the 
                        Kentucky
                     shore a few miles downriver from Pigeon Creek, some near Diamond Island, and probably
                    some at other places as well. In a series of letters to Leidy, the first dated in December, 1852,
                    David Dale Owen, who had served as the first state geologist of Indiana, described the sites in some
                    scientific detail and noted their similarities.15 Of the bones found around
                    Canoe Creek in 1854, he opined, "One thing … is very certain, both from the
                    position of these bones and those found, under analogous circumstances, in the banks of the 
                        Ohio
                    , below 
                        Evansville
                    , Vanderburg [sic] County, Indiana, that they are, comparatively
                    speaking, of a very recent date …."16 Owen
                    also referred to bones received from other discoverers and to his collection sent to 
                        Philadelphia
                     for description in a memoir Leidy was preparing for publication.17
                    By November, 1855, he was complaining that only a few of the bones of his collection had been
                    returned and of his own personal expense in paying for their shipment. In the final letter of this
                    series, dated April 28, 1856, Owen replied briefly and sharply to what apparently was a suggestion
                    from Leidy: "I could not consent to dispose of my Megalonyx bones. My address is 
                        New Harmony
                    , Posey Co. Inda., care warfboat or Dusouchet, 
                        Mt. Vernon
                    , Inda. I expect to be in Phila. soon—in two or three weeks and shall call at
                    the Acady."
            Both Norwood's and Owen's correspondence with Leidy attest to the importance of 
                        New Harmony
                     as an educational, cultural, and scientific center of national significance in the
                    early decades of the nineteenth century.18 In 1825 Robert Owen, Scots

                            made a major contribution to science." Alves later gave the bones of the Megalonyx, which became known as the Henderson sloth, to Owen. Eventually
                            the sloth was mounted at Indiana University, Blooming-ton, but "later was overtaken

                            Dale Owen's letter to Leidy, September 1,1860 (Academy of Natural Sciences of 
                                Philadelphia
                            ).
               
                     philanthropist, had purchased Father George Rapp's
                    Harmonist village on the 
                        Wabash
                     and had begun there a Utopian community from which he hoped to reform society and to
                    establish a New Moral World. A short time later William Maclure, renowned educator and scientist,
                    became Owen's principal associate and financial partner. Often called the "father
                    of American geology," Maclure was president of the Academy of Natural Sciences of 
                        Philadelphia
                     from 1817 to 1840, and he brought with him to 
                        New Harmony
                     a coterie of scientists and educators whose influence on the schools, laws, natural
                    sciences, and society of the 
                        United States
                     continued long after the collapse of Owen's dream in 1827-1828. During the
                    1830s, 1840s, and 1850s, in fact, 
                        New Harmony
                     "basked" in the intellectual "afterglow" created by
                    the Owen children—including David Dale —and the other accomplished scholars
                    who had come to 
                        New Harmony
                    . The community attracted visitors from Europe as well as from the eastern states; a
                    number of them stayed to participate in the activities there. Quite possibly, Leidy himself visited
                    the town.19
            
            Both David Dale Owen and Norwood were influential members of the scientific community at 
                        New Harmony
                    . Owen conducted the first official geological survey of Indiana from 1837 to 1839.
                    During 1839-1840 he was employed by the 
                        United States
                     Treasury Department, through the General Land Commissioner, to head geological surveys
                    in 
                  Iowa, Wisconsin
               , and northern 
                        Illinois
                     and again from 1847 to 1851 to head surveys in 
                  Wisconsin, Iowa
               , and 
                        Minnesota
                    . Concerning Owen's work in 1839—1840, a head curator of the 
                        United States
                     National Museum later wrote, "Indeed, the organization and carrying out of the
                    plan for … [the survey] within the short space of time and under the conditions imposed
                    by Congress was a feat of generalship which has never been equaled in American geological
                        history."20
            
            Norwood's first extensive work as a geologist was as Owen's chief assistant during
                    the survey of the Chippewa Land District of 
                        Wisconsin
                    . Before that work began in the summer of 1847, the two

                             and Owen received his from the Medical College of

                     men had together explored geological formations in central 
                        Kentucky
                     in 1846 and coauthored an article about them.21 Prior to January
                    29, 1847, Owen and Norwood had jointly written an elaborate letter urging the establishment of a 
                        Kentucky
                     geological survey.22 That the two were friends as well as
                    colleagues is suggested in a letter from David Dale Owen to his brother Richard in March, 1848:
                    "Dr. Norwood brought his family down from 
                        Madison
                     and staid several weeks at my house…."23 By the
                    end of 1851 the two men had coauthored three more articles,24 and Norwood had
                    moved with his wife and children to 
                        New Harmony
                     and had begun his work as the first state geologist of 
                        Illinois
                    .
            In 1854, the year that Francis A. Linck found the 
                        Evansville
                     dire wolf, Owen was appointed state geologist of 
                        Kentucky
                    , a position that Norwood had wanted badly. Perhaps the earliest existing manifestation
                    of this desire is in a letter dated January 24, 1853, from Norwood to his friend Robert Peter,
                    professor of chemistry at Transylvania University in 
                  Lexington, Kentucky
               :
                    "I will be plain and explicit with you. In the first place, the charge of the Survey of 
                        Kentucky
                     would afford me more pleasure than that of any other country under the sun, for the
                    sufficient reason, that I was born and reared in 
                        Kentucky
                    , and am, so far as I know, the only Ken-tuckian who has ever made Geology a special
                    study and business." Interesting in light of later developments was Norwood's
                    further assertion that his experience in field work was "at least, equal to that of any man
                    in the West—without exception?
                    
                        Lexington
                     should become the headquarters for the survey, Norwood thought. There the collections
                    could be assembled and the chemistry and palaeontology done. Peter would, of course, take charge of
                    the chemistry, and as to the palaeontology, "I must tell you that I have the best library I
                    have yet seen—and, so far as European collections are concerned,

            On April 24 Norwood still believed the position of 
                        Kentucky
                     state geologist would be his, despite rumors that 
                        Kentucky
                     Governor Lazarus W. Powell might give the post to Owen. "So far as I
                    know," he wrote Peter from 
                        Louisville
                    , "the Governor is yet uncommitted, and it is narrowed down to Owen or myself.
                    If Owen gets it, as a certain thing, all the collections will be taken out of the State—
                    the Chemistry will be done in Indiana…." Two days later, in a very bitter letter
                    to his friend, Norwood seethed about Powell's appointment of Owen, "This is to be
                    regretted, on every account." The governor wanted, Norwood surmised,
                    "the ‘prestige of a name.’ He has, simply,
                    committed a blunder as far as American Geologists are concerned…. The
                    Geology of 
                        Kentucky
                     is quite as important as that of any other Western state. It may be done roughly, or thoroughly and Scientifically.
                        ‘Prestige’ is a term I have not yet met with in science…."
            On July 3, 1854, not long before he sent drawings of Francis A. Linck's fossil to Leidy in 
                        Philadelphia
                    , Norwood wrote Peter one more letter concerning Owen's appointment as head of
                    the 
                        Kentucky
                     survey. It is clear that in the intervening two months his jealousy had hardened. That
                    Owen had not given the post of chemist to a Philadelphian, as he had possibly intended, Norwood
                    attributed to the governor's having learned "it probably would not do to shut
                    every thing out of 
                        Kentucky
                    ."26 Norwood then narrowed his attack to Owen's
                    private collections: 
                        He was for two years State Geologist of Indiana—Indiana has not a rock, fossil, or
                            mineral, to show that such a survey was ever made. He was for five years U. S. Geologist for
                                    
                        Iowa, Wisconsin
                     , and 
                                Minnesota
                            —The General Government has nothing to show for it, in the way of
                            rocks, fossils or minerals, with the exception of the rocks and minerals collected by myself
                            in 
                                Minnesota
                             and 
                                Wisconsin
                            , and the fossils collected in the Mauvaises Terre of Nebrasca, by Dr. Evans.
                            And, these last, (described by Dr. Leidy), are stated to belong to ‘Dr.
                            Owen's Collection.’—They are, I believe in the Smithsonian
                            Institution now.—The large collections of organic remains made during these
                            surveys are all incorporated with Dr. Owen's private collections, and there, I
                            suppose, they will remain. As some little dissatisfaction on these matters has been
                            manifested, perhaps he will do better for

                            . I hope he may.—As no one, out of the U. S. Survey, knows any thing
                            about these matters, you see the necessity for keeping this knowledge to yourself. In the
                            mean time, notice things. So will I. It is full time that a certain sort of political
                            humbuggery should be stopped.
                     There is no evidence that Norwood ever expressed his accusations publicly. In fact, they
                    are quite unlike anything in Norwood's publiccations 
                  
                     25 The letters from Norwood to Robert Peter repose in the Robert Peter
                            Letters, Transylvania University Library, 
                        Lexington, Kentucky

                     26 It is interesting to note that the post of chemist for the 
                                Kentucky
                             survey went to Peter, who maintained a long and cordial relationship with Owen.
                            Hendrickson, David Dale Owen, 114. The Robert Peter Letters in the
                            Transylvania University Library contain some fifty pieces of correspondence from Owen to
                            Peter in the years after 1854. Ibid., 145.
               
                     and other surviving letters. Nevertheless, his charges do elicit
                    questions: just what collections did Owen supply to the states where he did his surveys, and where
                    are those collections today? At the same time one must wonder if Norwood collected important
                    specimens during the 
                        Illinois
                     survey and where they are currently located.
            Commenting on Norwood's accusations, Owen's biographer wrote: 
                        The Hoosier geologist was ambitious and he was criticized by his jealous rivals. His one-time
                            assistant in the Northwest, Joseph G. Norwood, accused him of ruthless acquisition of
                            specimens, and of appropriating all specimens collected on public surveys. Owen, like all
                            confirmed collectors, did use every means to enlarge his museum, but Norwood's
                            charge was unjustified, for Owen always obeyed the letter of his instructions and supplied
                            collections when they were called for. One cannot refrain from believing, however, that the
                            best of the specimens found their way into the 
                                New Harmony
                             museum.21
                  
                     Owen's rather sharp letters to Leidy in 1855 and 1856 concerning the return of his
                    specimens suggests that the biographer may well have been correct.
            Tracing the various Owen collections is difficult. Owen's first public geological survey, in
                    1837-1839, was for the state of Indiana. He left no collections of specimens because none was called
                        for.28 As early as 1840, however, Owen proposed that a collection from his
                    1839-1840 survey of 
                  Iowa, Wisconsin
               , and northern 
                        Illinois
                     form "the nucleus of a national cabinet." Indeed, eighteen shipping
                    boxes of specimens from Owen's collection were sent to 
                        Washington
                    , D.C., where eventually they were placed in the National Museum.29
                    In 1854 the act providing for the 
                        Kentucky
                     survey required the state geologist to form a cabinet of geological and mineralogical
                    specimens,

                             museum.
                  
                     28 In 1916 W. S. Blatchley, himself an Indiana state geologist, shared
                            his thoughts about the legislative act that established the first Indiana geological survey
                            and appointed David Dale Owen the first state geologist: "This was probably the
                            first sum ever appropriated by a Legislature of Indiana for scientific purposes. That
                            eminent body evidently thought it was buying a gold brick and proposed to pay for it the
                            least sum possible. Here it was proposed to hire a man … [to] travel on foot or
                            on horseback through a wilderness from one end of the State to another and make a
                            ‘complete and minute’ geological survey…. Ye Gods and
                            little fishes! I wish the author of that bill were here … to take his
                            medicine." W. S. Blatchley, "A Century of Geology in Indiana,"

                     29 As a result of accidents, fires, and removals, this collection by
                            1943 had lost its identity. A similar fate befell a collection of nine shipping boxes of
                            specimens from the collection of William Maclure of 
                                New Harmony
                            . Concerning the 1847-1851 survey, there is a "Catalogue of geological
                            specimens collected by Dr. D. D. Owen and deposited in the Smithsonian Institution by the
                            Commissioner of the Land Office, December, 1851" in the annual report of the
                            Smithsonian Institution for 1854. Ninth Annual Report of the Board of Regents

                            , D.C., 1855), 393-96. This collection is the one to which Norwood referred in
                            his letter of July 3, 1854. See also Hendrickson, David Dale Owen, 50, 51,
                            51n, 149.
               
                     the collection, according to a later act, to be housed in the
                    capitol. Apparently, however, when Owen died on November 13, 1860, there were specimens collected
                    during the 
                        Kentucky
                     survey located at 
                        New Harmony
                    . Although directed by the 
                        Kentucky
                     legislature to obtain this collection "by suit or otherwise," the
                    attorney general, it appears, did not carry out the order. Whatever the case, Owen did establish a
                    "valuable museum" at 
                        Frankfort
                    ,30 but, probably for a number of reasons, the collection is no
                    longer in existence. As the first state geologist for 
                        Arkansas
                    , Owen also formed a collection of specimens that was set up in 
                        Little Rock
                    . In part because of the Civil War, the geological survey was discontinued after
                    Owen's death, and the collection was turned over to St. John's College in the
                    capital city. St. John's closed in May, 1861, and apparently "no archival
                    materials, books, specimens or artifacts of any kind" survived.31
            
            What happened to David Dale Owen's personal museum of some 85,000 items after his death in
                    November, 1860, is actually rather unclear. Richard Owen took charge of the collection in 
                        New Harmony
                     upon the death of his brother. In reference to the 
                        Arkansas
                     collection, he expressed his belief that duplicates of the specimens had indeed been
                    forwarded to 
                        Little Rock
                     for a state museum. Those remaining had been "placed in one room of the
                    laboratory, designated as the 
                        Arkansas
                     room." He further indicated that "some duplicates" had gone
                    to Indiana University.32 While the most recent history of the university
                    mentions the Owen cabinet and states very broadly that sometime "in 1859 or 1860 this huge
                    collection was transferred to Indiana University," the statement is both unsettling and
                    undocumented. Actually, the exact sequence of events and a precise description of the
                    school's holdings are difficult to determine, particularly for the years from 1860 to
                        1869.33

                            Bloomington
                        , 1970), 109. On the same page Clark states, "Since the arrival of the
                        famous 
                            New Harmony
                         scientists he [Owen] had been busily engaged with Alexander Maclure in surveying
                        and collecting geological specimens." This statement contradicts Hendrickson, David Dale Owen, 13-23, as does the assertion that most of Owen's
                        projects were supported by the 
                            United States
                         Geological Survey. Owen was federally employed less than half the time between 1838
                        and 1859 and even then not by the 
                            United States
                         Geological Survey. Also on page 109 the sentence, "Owen himself had
                        exhumed a gigantic atheroid (Megalxonyx) near 
                            Henderson
                        , 
                            Kentucky
                         …," is puzzling, not only because of the extra x or because the exhuming was performed by Miss Morton's schoolboys but also
                        because there is no atheroid in leading unabridged and technical dictionaries. Given these
                        discrepancies, one must agree with the reviewer who wrote of this book, "this work,
                        alas, is not footnoted." Winton U. Solberg, review of ibid., Indiana
                            Magazine of History, LXVTI (September, 1971), 268.
            
            
            In 1859 David Dale Owen was appointed, for a second time, Indiana state geologist. Because his
                    surveys in 
                        Kentucky
                     and 
                        Arkansas
                     were still in progress, it was arranged that his brother, Richard, would carry out most
                    of the field work in the Hoosier state. With David Dale Owen's death, Richard Owen became
                    the Indiana state geologist, a position that he held until 1862. In January, 1861, Richard Owen
                    offered to sell his brother's collection to the State Board of Agriculture for
                    $25,000. The offer was referred to a select committee, but no action was taken.34 In May of 1861 the legislature authorized the appropriation of funds for the
                    enlargement of the state university's cabinet, appointed the state geologist a member of
                    the university faculty, and required him to develop a collection of specimens in mineralogy and
                    geology for the cabinet.35 Because of the Civil War, little was done until 1864.
                    In that year the university's annual report spoke of "an extensive collection of
                    minerals, fossils, and zoological specimens, as well as … illustrative charts, diagrams,
                    and maps" that Richard Owen had brought to the school.36 Further, in
                    lectures during the summer of 1864 President Cyrus Nutt described the university cabinet as
                    "one of the largest and best in the West. Recently," he stated, "many
                    interesting portions of the cabinet of the late Dr. David Dale Owen, of 
                        New Harmony
                    , have been transferred to the State University, and now fill an entire wing of the
                        building."37 Not until 1869, however, did Indiana University
                    officially commit itself to the purchase of David Dale Owen's famous collection, the bulk
                    of which had apparently remained in 
                        New Harmony
                    . In February, 1869, Richard Owen wrote to Governor Conrad Baker: 
                  
                     
                        When I was last at new Harmony, my nephew Alfred, son of my late brother David Dale,
                                    the same who was Col. of the 80th, requested that I would write to you regarding
                                    their collection….

                                        indication of his interest in the establishment of a state agricultural college,
                                        a strong interest which, extending that of William Maclure, contributed to the
                                        founding of Purdue University, of which Richard Owen became the first president
                                        (1872-1874). See also Hendrickson, David Dale Owen, 128,

                                        new agricultural college at Indiana University, not elsewhere. Nutt proposed
                                        that the "citizens of 
                                            Monroe County
                                         [tender] … to the state, on condition that the new
                                        college be located there, the $50,000 Owen
                                        cabinet…." Woodburn comments, "It is not clear how
                                        President Nutt could say that the citizens of 
                                            Monroe County
                                         offered the Owen cabinet; it belonged to the University and
                                        therefore only the trustees could make such an offer." It now appears
                                        that even the university did not own the Owen cabinet at the time of
                                        Nutt's lecture. Ibid., 276, 276n.
                        
                        
                        You have seen the collection, although perhaps not under the most favorable
                                    circumstances, and therefore one or two particulars may not be out of place.
                        The total number of specimens (without estimating the duplicates) is 36,823. some of
                                    these are rare and costly: one single specimen, the Ichthyosaurus, cost
                                    $225. They represent not only minerals under a number of different
                                    systems, but the rocks and fossils illustrate pretty thoroughly the Geology of North
                                    America, 
                              England, France, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, Spain
                           , &c. There are besides numerous
                                    Zoological specimens and several thousand dollars worth of the finest chemical
                                    apparatus.
                        The family (although my brother estimated it at $50,000, having given all
                                    his surplus time and means to its formation) offered to take $20,000 for
                                    the entire collection.
                        As my brother left but little except the property on which the house and laboratory
                                    stand, they have but little to dispose of (the granary excepting, which was sold for
                                    a Woolen Factory) until they can find a purch[as]er for the collection. As my
                                    brother was identified with Indiana, and as the collection ought to remain in this
                                    State, and would be most valuable either at 
                                        Indianapolis
                                     or 
                                        Bloomington
                                     or a Normal School, any recommendation by which the subject could be
                                    brought before the public by you, would be gratefully esteemed by the family.38
                        
                     
                  
                Later in 1869 the state university purchased the Owen collection for the requested
                    $20,000. Transported from 
                        New Harmony
                     to 
                        Bloomington
                     in March, 1870, first via "the steamer West Wind," then on four
                    railroad cars, the twenty-to-thirty-ton collection provided the impetus for the construction of a
                    second building on the Indiana University campus to accommodate not only the Owen cabinet but the
                    law school, library, and other departments as well.39
            
            In July, 1883, fire, presumably started by lightning, destroyed the new building, many university
                    records, and most of the Owen collection "save a few of the tables of the
                        Museum…."40 During the week following the fire, either
                    in accord with or because of a plea from Indiana State Geologist John Collett, workers salvaged an
                    additional fraction of the Owen collection from the debris.41 As outlined in the
                    university catalogue for 1883-1884, "eight cases of minerals and fossils, comprising about
                    1,000 specimens, were saved. Among these are many of the types of new species described by Professor
                        [sic] DAVID DALE OWEN and, therefore, among the most valuable objects in the
                    OWEN collection. The skeleton of Megalonyx Jeffersoni, from Hendersonville

                     (whose name appears in the 1883 fire headline) arranged for the Owen specimens that had
                    survived the fire to be sent to the 
                        United States
                     National Museum (USNM, the Smithsonian Institution). These remains constituted three
                    boxes of fossils containing types of 22 species described by Owen in his 1852 report, 327 other
                    specimens from the upper Mississippi Valley region, and 5 types described by
                    Owen in an 1860 report for the

            Neither Norwood's career nor his extensive collection fared as well as those of Owen.
                    Although specimens collected during Norwood's geological survey of 
                        Illinois
                     originally formed the basis for the 
                        Illinois
                     State Museum, none attributed to him remain in the museum today. Only fragments are
                    traceable. In 1858 the governor of 
                        Illinois
                     dismissed Norwood as head of the state geological survey. Thereafter he served as
                    assistant to the 
                        Missouri
                     state geologist and as a professor at the University of 
                        Missouri
                     at 
                        Columbia
                    , where he died in 1895, never having achieved the prestige and reputation accorded his
                    colleague, Owen.45
            
            Although not unusual for executive and legislative directives, the 
                        Illinois
                     governor's instructions to Norwood in 1851 relative to his duties as 
                        Illinois
                     state geologist perhaps provided the basis for the problems that later developed:
                    "consult economy in the employ of assistants, having a strict view to the labor to be done,
                    and a vigorous prosecution of the work."46 Norwood's first
                    progress report in 1853 listed Anthony Varner and Amos H. Worthen as assistants and Henry Pratten as
                    "attached to" the survey. The report further described work completed in
                    twenty-four counties, praised Varner "on his skill as a draughtsman" and Worthen
                    for his work on the "magnificent collection of fossils."47
            
            Norwood did not report again until 1857, a delay that provided the focus for considerable legislative
                    and executive dissatisfaction. Among papers reposited in the 
                        Illinois
                     State Library, the 
                        Illinois
                     State Historical Library, and the 
                        Illinois
                     State Archives, the earliest trace of trouble for Norwood may be found in Governor Joel
                    A. Matteson's message to the "Honorable Speaker of the Senate," in
                    February, 1855. Matteson had, he said, requested the state geologist to remove his office,
                    laboratory, and exhibits from 
                        New Harmony
                     to 
                        Springfield
                    . "I … suggest," he continued, "that no more money
                    be paid out until a report be made by the state geologist, and that satisfactory to those having the
                    matter in charge, and if not satisfactory, that another be appointed."48 When the requested geological report was not forthcoming, a committee was appointed to

                     was inadequate, that a large amount of labor had been performed
                    at a comparatively small expense, and that the work had been well done. He concluded, "No
                    just cause of complaint can be urged against the present incumbent, Dr. Norwood, or any of his
                        assistants."49
            
            The progress report that Norwood submitted to the legislature later in 1857 should have helped to
                    corroborate the committee's findings. A number of the difficulties encountered during the
                    survey were, at least in part, the result of inadequate funding, poor legislative and executive
                    planning, and/or accidents of nature. Boxed ready for transportation from 
                        New Harmony
                     to 
                        Springfield
                     in December, 1854, Norwood's records and scientific apparatus, along with
                    "all the public collections," did not reach their destination until April of the
                    following year because of "the entire suspension of navigation on the Ohio
                    River." When the collections finally arrived in the 
                        Illinois
                     capital, no suitable laboratory space was available, and they were eventually placed in
                    the supreme court room "but could not be disposed in such a manner as to allow them to be
                    examined by the corps…."50 Later they were moved to the
                    Senate chamber but were still inaccessible for scientific use. Norwood apparently agreed with the
                    governor that the survey headquarters and specimens "rightfully belonged" in 
                        Illinois
                    —given his condemnation of Owen in the 
                        Kentucky
                     situation, how could he not—but in view of the eventual disappearance of
                    this first 
                        Illinois
                     state collection, one wonders what would have happened had Norwood kept the specimens
                    in 
                        New Harmony
                     until they could have been suitably displayed.
            Two additional subjects mentioned in Norwood's 1857 progress report suggest further
                    short-sightedness on the part of the 
                        Illinois
                     state government. The state geologist had "nearly ready for
                    publication," he said, material that would fill a volume of from one thousand to twelve
                    hundred pages. The legislature had apparently appropriated no funds for publications, for Norwood
                    "respectfully" urged "the propriety of publishing this report at the
                    earliest possible day." He also referred to a number of reports that he had made to
                    individuals and companies during the preceding two years, something that had been impossible under a
                    directive from an earlier governor, who had wanted it "distinctly understood" that
                    all information regarding the geological survey was to be kept "strictly private"
                    and reported only to the executive of the state who "alone" could make it
                        public.51

            Not mentioned in the official papers are the deaths of Varner and Pratten and the absence of Worthen,
                    who assisted James Hall of 
                        New York
                     in the first state geological survey of 
                        Iowa
                     from 1855 to 1857. The loss of all three of his assistants, albeit at various times,
                    would have had an incalculable impact on Norwood's ability to carry out the 
                        Illinois
                     survey. Varner had not turned in his field notes for a year before his death in 1854,
                    "rendering it necessary" for Norwood to be with him during his illness and
                    occasioning some delay.52 In 1857, fearing that Pratten was going to die of
                    erysipelas —as he did a few days later—Norwood wrote a mutual friend,
                    "If he does leave us, to me it will be like losing my right hand."53 One wonders if the state geologist knew that Pratten, the year before, had also
                    considered leaving the 
                        Illinois
                     project to work with Hall. Pratten had remained in 
                        Springfield
                    , "one of the most miserable places I have ever lived in," only
                    because he feared that he would be unable to support his new wife elsewhere.54
            
            Norwood had obviously reached a turning point in his career. Whether or not there was "just
                    cause" for his dismissal as state geologist, by 1858 the move was inevitable. The 
                        Illinois
                     governor's report to the legislature in 1859 confirmed: "From the
                    unsatisfactory progress made … and from the fact that nothing in relation to the survey
                    had ever been published or even presented for publication (with [one exception]) it was deemed
                    essential to reorganize the corps. This was done last spring (March 22, '58) and A. H.
                    Worthen was placed at its head."55 One final irony seems to typify
                    Norwood's career. In December, 1857, Hall had written Norwood from 
                        New York
                    : "I have no opposition to you, nor will I do anything to affect your position.
                    If it is in any way possible for me to help you to bring before the public the
                    results of your labors of so many years past I shall be most happy to do so…."
                    During the same month, however, Hall, commenting to other geologists that the governor of 
                        Illinois
                     contemplated replacing Norwood with "a more efficient man," had
                    provided supporting letters for two other aspirants for the position of 
                        Illinois
                     state geologist, one of whom was Worthen.56

                        H. A. Ulffers, the 
                            Illinois

                            Illinois
                         Geological Survey at that time: "The geological room in the armory
                        building cannot be warmed so as to keep up an even temperature—water actually
                        freezing within ten feet of a red hot stove." Ulffers to Norwood, in Reports Made to the Twentieth General Assembly of the State of

            Approximately fifty years after Norwood's discharge from the 
                        Illinois
                     survey, a curator of the 
                        Illinois
                     Museum of Natural History wrote something of a vindication of the first 
                        Illinois
                     state geologist: "In behalf of Dr. Norwood it might be noted… that
                    even his talented successor did not bring out his first report until 1866—that is after
                    eight years in the office, having Norwood's seven year's [sic]
                    collections to build upon and an especial appropriation of $21,000 for printing, etc., as
                    well as his own fourteen years' experience. This does not detract from the credit of
                    Worthen but implies that Norwood was expected to make bricks without straw."57 In 1853 David Dale Owen had described the 
                        Illinois
                     collection amassed by Norwood as "the finest collection ever made in the same
                    length of time, on any survey that has come within my notice…"; it was, he said,
                    a collection "rich in minerals and fossils; some of rare beauty and
                        perfection…."68 Four years later G. C. Swallow, 
                        Missouri
                     state geologist, had characterized it as very large and, "when properly
                    arranged and set up in a suitable room," certain to be "a source of pride and
                    gratification" to every citizen of the state.59 At the end of the
                    nineteenth century museum curators were still "surprised" at the
                    collection's size.60
            
            Among the most important specimens that should be located in the 
                        Illinois
                     collection today are twenty-five of thirty-one type specimens figured in three
                    publications by Norwood and Pratten and explicitly described by them as belonging to the state
                        collection.61 Of the twenty-five, only one remains in any of the three parts
                    into which the collection was divided apparently sometime after the turn of the century. The
                    disappearance of all but this one, the Chonetes maclurea Norwood and Pratten, ISGS
                    (ISM) 4571-1/5, remains a mystery.62

                        Pratten and Ullfers. Shortly after Pratten's death, his cabinets of fossils and
                        minerals and his collection of birds were officially appraised by Norwood and Ulffers in the
                        amounts of $800, $150, and $700 respectively. Appraisement Bill

            The fate of David Dale Owen's collections of duplicate specimens, reposited in state and
                    federal capitals, suggests that Owen may have been justified in keeping types and superior specimens
                    in his own 
                        New Harmony
                     cabinet. Whether or not he "did better" by 
                        Kentucky
                     and 
                        Arkansas
                    , as Norwood hoped, the collections that Owen left for those states were soon lost, as
                    were the two he shipped to 
                        Washington
                    . Owen understood that he was employed by states and the federal government for
                    practical results, not fine collections. In an introductory letter published with his 1852 report,
                    he wrote: "it has been my aim during the entire conduct of this exploration, to make the
                    strictly practical and business portion of the Survey the chief end and object of our operations.
                    Scientific researches, which to some may seem purely speculative and curious, are essential as
                    preliminaries to these practical results. Further than such necessity dictates, they have not been
                    pushed…." In another report he reaffirmed, "time enough will remain to
                    institute inquiries (which a liberal policy forbids us to overlook) of a less productive and more
                    abstract character; inquiries which are interesting in a scientific, rather than a commercial point
                    of view."63
            
            Norwood, on the other hand, was ready to use state funds for a survey done "thoroughly and Scientifically." His publications,
                    which are primarily paleontological, reflect the balance that he struck between practical and
                    scientific geology. In fact, in this regard both Norwood and Worthen, his successor in 
                        Illinois
                    , stood closer to the James Hall school of geological survey than to that of Owen.64
            
            After working closely together for several years, Norwood's and Owen's careers
                    diverge after 1853. Owen, in fact, does not appear to have commented about Norwood's
                    troubles in 
                        Illinois
                    , nor is there anything to suggest that he was aware of Norwood's accusations
                    at the outset of the 
                        Kentucky
                     geological survey. Other bits and pieces of their lives also make for interesting
                    reflection. Given the restrictions placed on Norwood regarding the release of geological information

                        New Harmony

                    Epilogue
                
            As for the dire wolf, prospects for additional recoveries of specimens from the Ohio
                    River are doubtful. The water level, now regulated by dams, is kept at least eleven feet
                    higher than the low water in which the bones were found in the mid-1850s. Some 120 years after
                    Linck's find, however, scientists discovered more dire wolf remains in Indiana,
                    interestingly enough, in 
                        Monroe County
                     near Indiana University. "The prize of the 1989 season," according to
                    a correspondent from the Indiana State Museum in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , "was the recovery of a beautifully preserved skull and jaws, and much of the
                    skeleton of an adult male dire wolf, well preserved in clays dated at 25,500 B.P."67
            
            Based on remains found at Devil's Den in Nevada, the terminal record for Canus
                        dims Leidy is listed at seven to eight thousand years ago.68 In 1854
                    David Dale Owen indicated that bones from the banks of the Ohio River below 
                        Evansville
                    , including those of his and Linck's Megalonyx and the dire
                    wolf, were "comparatively speaking, of a very recent date.".69. In 1870 paleobotanist Leo Lesquereux took wood samples from the
                    river near the 
                        Vanderburgh County
                     site. These samples were later carbon dated at an age of 9,400 years, the age accepted
                    with some reservations as the terminal record for Megalonyx..10. Perhaps the 
                        Evansville
                     dire wolf lived at about the same time.

            Claude G. Bowers's career as a writer, scholar, and diplomat has been well documented by
                    historians. Born in 
                        Westfield
                    , Indiana, in 1878, Bowers distinguished himself for four decades as a
                    historian–his classic works included Jefferson and Hamilton: The Struggle
                        for Democracy in America (1925) and Beveridge and the Progressive Era
                    (1932)–and as a journalist who wrote for the 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    Sentinel,

                        New York City
                     in 1923 to work for the

                    World and later the

                    Journal. Bowers was an ardent Democrat, and his service to the party in the 1920s
                    and his support of Franklin D. Roosevelt earned him an appointment in 1933 as ambassador to 
                        Spain
                     and in 1939 as ambassador to 
                        Chile
                    , where he was considered "among the most popular and successful envoys in
                    Latin America" despite not being a professional diplomat and not speaking Spanish.1
            
            Bowers's role in Democratic politics prior to his appointment as ambassador in 1933 has also
                    been highlighted in a number of studies, but his contribution to the party during the 1930s while

                        Chile
                     is less well known and detailed. Of special significance during these years is the
                    close personal and political friendship that Bowers established with James A. Farley, Democratic
                    national committee chairman and postmaster general from 1933 to 1940. At Farley's request
                    Bowers continued to play an important part in party affairs as an advisor, speechwriter, and
                    publicist while carrying out his duties as ambassador. The lengthy and revealing correspondence
                    between these two men spans twenty years and documents Bowers's vital role in the
                    Democratic party in the early 1930s, his frustration with the administration's policy
                    toward the Spanish Civil War, and his close and candid friendship with Farley. More importantly, the
                    correspondence provides a unique perspective on the changing nature of the Democratic party during
                    the New Deal years. Loyal Democrats, Bowers and Farley belonged to a party that in 1932 was welded
                    together by partisanship, patronage, and a commitment to party regularity. By 1940 politics and
                    policymaking were altered under the far-reaching changes brought about by New Deal programs and
                    Roosevelt's commitment to forging a new, liberal Democratic coalition. Bower's and
                    Farley's letters reflect the significance of this New Deal realignment and reveal the
                    frustrations of two men who often found these changes difficult to perceive and even harder to
                    accept.
            At first glance it is difficult to imagine two men such as Bowers and Farley developing a close
                    friendship. Bowers's background as a native Hoosier, gifted scholar, and successful
                    journalist contrasted with Farley's life as a part-time businessman and professional
                    politician from 
                        Rockland County
                    , 
                        New York
                    . Yet the men were similar in personality and political background. Both were
                    personable, humble, hardworking, and ambitious; and both were ardent Democrats who toyed briefly,
                    but mostly unsuccessfully, with elective office: Bowers failed in a bid for Congress in 1904 while
                    Farley served one term as a state assemblyman in 
                        New York
                     before losing reelection. Most importantly, they shared a love of politics and a mutual
                    admiration for Franklin D. Roosevelt, with whom their future careers would become intertwined.2
            
            Roosevelt recruited Bowers and Farley for his 1932 presidential campaign. Longtime Democrats well
                    known among the regular party faithful at the state and local levels, the two men provided
                    experience vital to FDR's election hopes. Equally important were their unique talents and
                    abilities–Bowers as a prolific writer and Farley as an organizer. Bowers had met
                    Roosevelt after coming to 
                        New York
                     in 1923 to write for the 
                        New York
                    
                    World. FDR admired the Hoosier's writings on Thomas Jefferson, his astute
                    political 
                  
                     2 Background on James A. Farley's early career can be found
                            in his autobiographical account, Behind the Ballots: The Personal History of a
                                Politician (
                                New York
                            , 1938), 3-57.
               
                     advice, and his devotion to the Democratic party. As a result of
                    Roosevelt's lobbying, Bowers delivered a speech at the traditional Democratic
                    Jefferson-Jackson Day dinner in 1928 and later was selected to be a keynote speaker at the 1928
                        convention.3
            
            Farley's contacts with upstate leaders and his reputation for honest and hard work were the
                    principal reasons that FDR chose the New Yorker for the 1932 campaign. A well-respected county
                    chairman from 
                        Rockland County
                    , Farley became a staunch ally of Governor Alfred E. Smith who appointed him to the 
                        New York
                     State Boxing Commission in 1924. When Smith decided to run for president in 1928 and
                    convinced Roosevelt to run for his vacated governor's chair, Roosevelt selected Farley as
                    his campaign chairman.4 When Roosevelt opted to run for president after two
                    successful terms as governor, it was not surprising that both Bowers and Farley were chosen to play
                    significant roles in his campaign.
            While Roosevelt was the catalyst for the Bowers-Farley friendship, it was soon apparent that the two
                    men had a deep admiration for each other's talents and abilities. In his memoirs Bowers
                    described Farley as a "man of attractive personality and political tact, combined with rare
                    organizing ability," one who "was to become perhaps the greatest campaign manager
                    in our history." Bowers felt Farley's success and popularity were based on his
                    frankness and openness, something he, as a newspaperman, could well appreciate.5
            
            Farley considered Bowers, too, to be a man of many talents. During the campaign he relied upon
                    Bowers's astute political wisdom and as campaign manager and party chairman he made the
                    most of the journalist's ability as an effective speaker and writer. The 1932 campaign was
                    traditional and partisan and well suited to Bowers's talents. Initially, Bowers preferred
                    to work behind the scenes so as to avoid conflict with his newspaper, which was owned by staunch
                    Republican William Randolph Hearst. He counseled Roosevelt privately on Republican strategy and
                    warned him about Republican attempts to create the false belief that the Depression would soon be
                    over and that "prosperity was just around the corner." Roosevelt labeled
                    Bowers's advice as "right on the money." In

                     August, when Bowers was asked by reporters to comment publicly
                    about Roosevelt's statement regarding the need to regulate Wall Street, he found it
                    difficult to maintain his low public profile and went on record as supporting the
                    president's statement.
            Then, as the campaign moved into its final months, he assumed a more active and public role. When
                    asked to substitute for Roosevelt on a nationwide radio speech, he did so and delivered what Farley
                    called "one of the best speeches in the campaign." He also visited his native
                    state of Indiana to deliver an address to party workers in 
                        Terre Haute
                    , where he found, much to his amazement, that Farley, who had been through 
                        Terre Haute
                     only briefly, was already being referred to by party leaders as a "next door
                    neighbor." Bowers also delivered campaign addresses to small groups in 
                        Syracuse
                     and Buffalo where he denounced manufacturing interests who tried to intimidate their
                        workingmen.6
            
            Roosevelt's overwhelming victory on November 8, 1932, virtually guaranteed Bowers some type
                    of position in the new administration. It would be with Farley's assistance that he would
                    obtain it. Shortly after the conclusion of the campaign Bowers contacted Farley and stated that his
                    contract with the Hearst organization was about to expire and that he was interested in a possible
                    position as ambassador to 
                        Spain
                    . Farley noted in a memo that he was "more than happy" to recommend
                    him to Roosevelt, who was reportedly pleased with Bowers's ambition. Farley cleared the
                    matter with newly appointed Secretary of State Cordell Hull and had presidential advisor Raymond
                    Moley tender the official offer, which Bowers quickly accepted.7
            
            Bowers's appointment was a reward for his loyalty to Roosevelt and his longtime service to
                    the party. During the early Roosevelt administration loyalty and party regularity were considered
                    time-honored principles. The term "For Roosevelt Before 
                        Chicago
                    " was one used by Farley in determining who should receive positions in the new
                    administration. Ambassadorships were a convenient way to reward loyal party members for their
                    service. In addition to Bowers, other longtime Democrats such as Breckinridge Long (
                        Italy
                    ), William C. Bullitt (Russia), and John Cudahy (
                        Poland
                    ) also received appointments. So concerned was Roosevelt in distributing patronage
                    throughout the party that he asked Bowers if he could formally submit his name to Congress as a
                    resident of Indiana. Conscious of how many appointments he had already made from his home state of 
                        New York
                    , FDR hoped Bowers could qualify as a midwesterner. When Bowers told the president that
                    he owned no property in Indiana and had had no residence there in the past

                eight years, Roosevelt said he would send his name in as coming from both Indiana and 
                        New York
                    .8 The concepts of loyalty and regularity would soon give way to a
                    more nonpartisan approach to party affairs that made loyalty to the liberal New Deal program
                    tantamount to loyalty to the party organization.
            While in Madrid, Bowers maintained his friendship with Farley and remained active in party affairs.

                     abreast of political developments and continued to play an
                    important role as advisor and speechwriter. The correspondence between the two men, beginning in
                    early 1933, indicates that Farley relied upon Bowers for political advice and speeches, while Bowers
                    gleaned from Farley a revealing look at political issues, personalities, and events that he could
                    not obtain elsewhere. Bowers likewise provided Farley a candid view of diplomatic developments
                    overseas.
            One of Bowers's biggest contributions to the party and to Farley personally was in the form
                    of political advice; in addition, he wrote many of the speeches that Farley would deliver during his
                    tenure as party chairman, especially during the 1934 congressional campaign. Partisanship was still
                    a major part of Democratic strategy in 1934, and both Farley and Bowers were well versed in this
                    tactic. One of the many roles Farley performed as postmaster general and chairman of the party was
                    that of presidential spokesman. Between 1933 and 1937 he promoted New Deal policies and supported
                    administration measures across the country, delivering over 260 major addresses at the dedication of
                    post offices, testimonial dinners, or Democratic gatherings. Bowers's proclivity for
                    writing and his interest in party affairs made him one of Farley's favorite
                    "ghostwriters. "9
            
            As early as June, 1933, Bowers was already offering suggestions about Democratic publicity, and by
                    the fall of 1934 Bowers and Farley were communicating frequently by mail and telephone concerning
                    the upcoming congressional campaign. Despite political problems generated by civil unrest in 
                        Spain
                    , and his diplomatic responsibilities, Bowers was only too happy to oblige his
                    friend's requests for speeches. In one particular letter to Farley he wrote: "You
                    fixed upon a lovely time to ask me to think and write of politics. As I write the guns are booming
                    and an occasional bomb goes off." Despite writing behind closed steel shutters and
                    answering the telephone every five to ten minutes, Bowers sent Farley speeches that, he noted,
                    "you can improve upon or maybe get some idea of your own from."10
            
            A common theme in Bowers's speeches was Republican responsibility for the Great Depression.
                    The ambassador counseled Farley that the Republican "reactionaries" would be on
                    the offensive during the campaign and that the best way to handle them would be to put them on the
                    defensive. In one particular speech that Farley

               , in
                    June, 1934, Bowers labeled prominent Republican leaders such as Ogden Mills, Andrew Mellon, and
                    others as "wells without water and cupboards without bread" when the country had
                    been facing catastrophe several years earlier. He called them the "directing brains of
                    Hoover's period of suicide and soup." A year later the same theme was present in
                    Farley's speech to Young Democrats in 
                        Louisville
                    .11
            
            Bowers wrote several more speeches for Farley during the campaign. In October Farley told Bowers that
                    he had a half dozen speeches to give before election day and asked if Bowers could write an address
                    comparing Roosevelt and Andrew Jackson. The result was a speech entitled "The New Deal and
                    Old Hickory," which Farley delivered in Scranton, 
                        Pennsylvania
                    .12
            
            The Democrats scored a significant victory in the 1934 elections, increasing their already favorable
                    margin in both houses of Congress by thirteen seats in the House and nine in the Senate. Farley was
                    quick to give Bowers much of the credit for the victory. In a lengthy letter following the election
                    Farley thanked Bowers for his help, noted how useful the material sent for speeches proved to be,
                    especially in 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , and praised him for his contribution to the campaign. He added, "I want you
                    to feel that you played your part in the campaign in a very substantial way."13
            
            Bowers was delighted with the results of the campaign. He was especially pleased to hear that in his
                    home state of Indiana Republican Senator Arthur R. Robinson had been defeated, but he shared
                    Farley's regret that Indiana Democrat R. Earl Peters, a staunch Roosevelt supporter since
                    1931, had lost in the Democratic primary to Sherman Minton. Farley told Bowers that he liked Peters
                    personally and thought of him as an "ardent" Roosevelt supporter, but he had
                    advised the president against any public support in the spring primary for fear of involving the
                    administration in a bitter dispute that might further divide the party. The fact that Minton was
                    supported by Paul V. McNutt, head of the Hoosier Democratic Club, which had contributed
                    $12,000 to help pay off the Democratic party deficit, may have also helped convince
                    Farley to maintain his neutrality. Farley confided to Bowers that he was sorry about
                    Peters's defeat. Bowers was particularly happy to receive Farley's detailed letter
                    because, he noted, most Americans received their news from the 
                        Paris
                    
                    Herald, which in turn received it from the 
                        New York
                    
                    Herald Tribune, a "rank Republican" newspaper. He noted,

                     too, how the Republican press was attacking Farley and stated
                    that it was "reassuring since it showed Farley was doing his job."14
            
            Despite the partisan nature of the victory in 1934 there were already signs that Roosevelt was moving
                    toward forging a more liberal coalition of voters. Especially frustrating to Farley, although he
                    failed to note it to Bowers, was the president's support of several progressive Republicans
                    including Robert M. La Follette, Jr., in 
                        Wisconsin
                     and George W. Norris in 
                        Nebraska
                    , support that caused many traditional Democrats to wonder whose side the president was
                    on. Farley's frustration over Roosevelt's support of La Follette was summed up
                    best in a letter to presidential advisor Louis M. Howe which stated, "There isn't
                    much I can say and there isn't much you can say either, he wants to see him
                        reelected."15 It was the first sign that partisanship was eroding.
            The friendship between Bowers and Farley grew stronger in the year following the election. Bowers
                    praised Farley's speeches as "meaty and effective" and complimented him
                    as having "developed into a real speaker." He added, "I am not a courtier
                    and not given to flattery," but "you have developed the knack so soon."
                    Farley on the other hand appreciated the advice and recommendations on publicity and confided in the
                    ambassador candidly on sensitive political matters. Farley was most concerned about the opposition
                    that Roosevelt's proposed Public Utility Holding Company Act was receiving from the utility
                    companies. Bowers predicted that the utility companies would undoubtedly mount a massive
                    letter-writing campaign to Congress on the part of workers and stockholders in an effort to defeat
                    the bill and geared some of his speeches and recommendations on publicity toward countering such
                    propaganda. Despite intense opposition and the "one million dollar fund" that
                    Bowers claimed was spent to defeat the bill, the Public Utility Holding Company Act became law in
                        1935.16
            
            At Farley's request Bowers continued to act as a publicist throughout 1935. In June the
                    ambassador asked Farley to send him information before the first of September concerning what the
                    administration had done for farmers and how farmers had fared during the Hoover administration. He
                    also requested statistical information on bank failures during the period from 1929 to 1933, facts
                    concerning unemployment and taxes, and speeches and addresses the administration had made on New
                    Deal topics. By

                     October Bowers had prepared several speeches and statements that
                    Farley labeled "great stuff." He told Bowers they were planning to use the
                    material in 
                        Maryland
                     and 
                        Connecticut
                     and in press releases from Democratic headquarters.17
            
            It was not surprising, given Bowers's contribution as a speech-writer, advisor, and
                    publicist, that both Roosevelt and Farley hoped his services could be obtained on a full-time basis
                    for the 1936 campaign. As early as June, 1935, Democratic Committeeman and Senator from 
                        Pennsylvania
                     Joseph Guffey asked Bowers if he might be interested in returning to the 
                        United States
                     to work as an editorial writer for either the 
                        Philadelphia
                    
                    Record or 
                        New York
                    
                    Evening Post, two papers owned by Democrat J. David Stern. Guffey also inquired
                    about Bowers's accepting some publicity work for the Democratic National Committee during
                    the forthcoming campaign.18
            
            Although flattered by the offer, Bowers was reluctant to leave his post as ambassador. He told Guffey
                    that he had accepted the ambassadorship to get away from what had been a twenty-year grind of
                    writing editorials and to help his daughter who was then enrolled in college in 
                        Spain
                    . He confided that it would not be fair to "deprive her of the pleasure she is
                    finding here." Most importantly, he boasted, "I have accomplished more toward
                    resolving the misunderstanding of our two nations than any of my predecessors and I want to finish
                    the job." He added that Spanish editorials referred to him as "the most
                    sympathetic and understanding envoy sent by the 
                        United States
                     since 
                        Washington
                     Irving," who was idolized in 
                        Spain
                    . He did not rule out doing some work on the committee, however, and said he would
                    discuss it with Guffey when he returned to the 
                        United States
                     for a brief visit during the summer.19
            
            The question of Bowers's participation in the 1936 campaign did arise again during his visit
                    home during the summer of 1935, but Bowers remained reluctant to give up his post for politics.
                    Roosevelt was hopeful that he and several other ambassadors would resign their positions to return
                    home to work on the campaign. When stories surfaced later in the year that Bowers's
                    resignation would be forthcoming, Bowers became upset and wrote National Committeeman Daniel C.
                    Roper a blistering letter stating emphatically that "there was no agreement about my
                    resigning." He noted that he had agreed to return shortly before the convention to work on
                    publicity for the campaign but that he had "no intention of resigning." He stated
                    that his appointment was the "only recognition

                    never expect another" and added that the story of his resignation had upset him and had
                    been like a "sword hanging over my head for a year."20
            
            It was Farley who reassured his friend that he would not have to resign his position but instead
                    could take a "leave of absence" to avert any charge that he was campaigning while
                    on the government payroll. Farley reiterated that "the President would do whatever you want
                    to do." This satisfied Bowers. He received a sixty-day leave of absence from the state
                    department and purchased a ticket to return to the 
                        United States
                     in August to participate in the campaign, but the outbreak of the civil war in 
                        Spain
                     made it impossible for him to leave.21
            
            Farley's letters to Bowers during the 1936 campaign kept the ambassador abreast of
                    developments and strategy, but they are equally significant for what they failed to tell Bowers
                    about the campaign, Farley's role in it, and the changing direction of the party. By 1936
                    Roosevelt's strategy for reelection had shifted from one that stressed partisanship and the
                    regular party organization to one that rarely mentioned the Democratic party and recruited
                    traditionally nonpartisan and formerly Republican groups who had a vital stake in New Deal relief
                    and recovery programs. As early as December, 1935, Roosevelt noted that it would be a New Deal
                    rather than a Democratic party that was submitted to the electorate in 1936. He wanted special
                    emphasis put on attracting such groups as organized labor, farmers, black Americans, young people,
                    women, and independents, all of whom had a stake in New Deal policies. The campaign to attract these
                    voters would be less partisan and would operate in many instances through auxiliary and nonparty
                    committees outside the regular party structure.22
            
            The less partisan nature of the campaign and the effort to attract traditionally non-Democratic
                    groups led Roosevelt to diminish Farley's role as chairman of the national committee.
                    Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes and Presidential Secretary Stephen T. Early both expressed
                    reservations about Farley's ability to direct such an effort given his lack of commitment
                    on many issues at Cabinet meetings and his belief in party loyalty and regularity. Eleanor

                     Roosevelt, always a supporter of Farley, expressed similar
                    concerns. Negative reports about Farley's preparation for the campaign from Eddie Roddan,
                    an experienced newspaperman whom Roosevelt assigned to the Democratic National Committee to help
                    with publicity, contributed further to Roosevelt's belief that Farley's
                    involvement should be curtailed. As a result, Farley, while still chairman, remained backstage with
                    limited speeches and public appearances. It is doubtful that Farley realized at this point that the
                    strategy was a clear indication that the traditional party organization was being supplanted in
                    importance by the recruitment of constituencies which Roosevelt believed would bring about a more
                    liberal Democratic party. Farley's letters to Bowers in July and October spoke only of a
                    busy campaign and predicted, with amazing accuracy, Roosevelt's landslide reelection.23
            
            The years immediately following the election were critical ones for both Bowers and Farley. The
                    eruption of the Spanish Civil War in July, 1936, and the approaching war in Europe occupied most of
                    Bowers's time and led him into a number of disagreements with State Department officials
                    about the course of American foreign policy, while political controversies and philosophical
                    differences over the way the Democratic party should be run ruptured the once close relationship
                    between Farley and Roosevelt. Events both at home and abroad dramatized the fact that politics and
                    policymaking as Bowers and Farley knew them had changed. If the two were aware of such changes, they
                    did not explicitly state them to each other; but the tone of their letters reveals the frustrations
                    of men whose influence was lessening and whose counsel was no longer sought on a regular basis.
            Between 1937 and 1940 Bowers wrote Farley several letters in which he detailed the fast-moving crises
                    in foreign affairs. Because he trusted Farley, the letters were candid and often revealed emotions
                    he did not spell out in more normal diplomatic correspondence. Much of what Bowers had to say
                    concerned the Spanish Civil War, a conflict that pitted the incumbent Loyalist government against a
                    rebel force led by Francisco Franco. Bowers was adamant in his opinion that the war was not a civil
                    war at all but a case of fascism versus democracy. He noted that as early as 1934 the rebels
                    attempting to overthrow the Spanish government had entered into an agreement with the Fascist
                    government in 
                        Italy
                     led by Benito Mussolini and the German Nazi government headed by Adolf Hitler. Bowers
                    claimed that Franco had come more and more to rely upon 
                        Rome
                     and Berlin and had gone over to their side "bag and baggage." He
                    estimated that the Italians had an army of 70,000 to 80,000 troops in 
                        Spain
                     while the Nazis had anywhere from 12,000 to 20,000 soldiers fighting with the rebels.
                    He credited the fall of 
                  
                     23 See note 22 above.
               
                     Barcelona in early 1939 to those "detestable
                    bastards." Bowers added, too, that what started out as a rebellion against the Spanish
                    democracy had under the stress of war developed into a social revolution. He noted that he had just
                    forwarded to the State Department a book written by the head of universities and secondary schools
                    in Franco's government, Jose Pemartin, which he argued would do for Franco's 
                        Spain
                     what Hitler's Mein Kampf did for 
                        Germany
                    . He stated that the Franco program, as noted in the book, called for the taking over of
                    the landed estates and the nationalization of industry and banking and the church.24
            
            Bowers was equally candid in his criticism of Allied policy in the face of impending rebel takeover
                    in 
                        Spain
                    , a policy that he believed aided the Nazis and the fascists but hindered the forces of
                    democracy. He added that the majority of the Spanish people were "with the
                    Democracy" but had not been permitted to buy arms due to the neutrality policies
                    established by Great Britain, 
                        France
                    , and the 
                        United States
                    , policies that prohibited such arms sales but that did nothing to stop 
                        Italy
                     and 
                        Germany
                     from continuing to help Franco. He was caustic in his criticism of the Munich
                    Conference in 1938, which led to a policy of "appeasement" with the Nazi regime;
                    and he labeled British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, architect of the policy, as a
                    "colossal ass–or crook" for giving Hitler and Mussolini everything they
                    wanted. In 1939 he concluded one five-page, confidential letter by stating that these were only his
                    impressions, but "I have guessed right for two and one half years when most of my
                    colleagues have fundamentally guessed wrong and I think the survey of the scene here is reasonably
                        correct."25
            
            Bowers expressed these same views, in a less dramatic tone, in his letters to Secretary of State Hull
                    and Roosevelt. Although supportive of the Spanish cause and at odds with the State Department over
                    their support of the Franco forces, Bowers exerted little influence on American policymaking during
                    the period. Roosevelt's desire to preserve 
                        Spain
                     from fascist rule was either small or nonexistent at the time, something Bowers failed
                    to perceive. The president's principal objective was to keep the conflict from escalating
                    into an all-out European war. Since the proof of German or Italian involvement was not overwhelming,
                    Roosevelt was reluctant to impose an embargo against either country. He was willing to accept

                     a Franco victory rather than risk a bigger and wider war, a fact
                    Bowers found hard to accept.26
            
            When the Franco forces finally succeeded in taking control of the country in 1939, Bowers was
                    recalled. His opposition to Franco and support of the Loyalists, coupled with the impending U.S.
                    recognition of Franco, made his presence in Madrid diplomatically impossible. Recalled in the
                    spring, he had some satisfaction in knowing that he had indeed been right in his assessment of the
                    Spanish situation during the past several years. A seemingly downcast Roosevelt told him upon his
                    return, "I have made a mistake. You have been right all along. I have been imposed upon by
                    false information from across the street [State Department],"27
            
            There is some evidence that Roosevelt may have deceived Bowers by leading him to believe that the
                    decision to recognize Franco was generated more by the State Department than the oval office when in
                    reality it may have been Roosevelt's decision all along. Perhaps an effort to pacify Bowers
                    and prevent him from writing publicly about American policy toward 
                        Spain
                    , the president offered him the post of ambassador to 
                        Chile
                    . If this was the motive for Bowers's appointment, or if Bowers did blame
                    Roosevelt for the fall of 
                        Spain
                    , he did not confide it to Farley or in his memoirs. Still, his frustration with the way
                    events turned out in 
                        Spain
                     lingered. He expressed his displeasure to Farley at the way the American press
                    portrayed him as "red" because "I stood and still stand for Democracy in 
                        Spain
                     against the Nazi-Fascist conspiracy to destroy it as a preliminary to the beginning of
                    the war to Nazise Europe."28
            
            Following Bowers's appointment as ambassador to 
                        Chile
                    , a post he would hold until 1953, his correspondence with Farley continued to highlight
                    the approaching war in Europe. Although he hoped his new position would take him far from the
                    European conflict, he soon found that South America was also caught in the impending world
                    cataclysm. Bowers confided to Farley that the Nazis were out to limit American influence in South
                    America and to destroy the 
                        Monroe
                     Doctrine. He spent much of his time combating Nazi and fascist propaganda and dealing
                    with the "many problems" regarding the American neutrality policy. A major concern
                    as well was the large German population living in 
                        Chile
                    . Bowers would not be surprised, he said, if the Nazis launched a coup to "take
                    over the government for Hitler."29
            
            Farley's friendship and Bowers's trust in it led the ambassador to express his
                    assessments more candidly to Farley than he did to

                     his colleagues in the State Department or government. He was
                    especially critical of Republican leaders whom he described as "making royal asses of
                    themselves." Senator Robert A. Taft, Bowers explained, is "playing to the
                    Germans," while "Little pee-wee [Thomas E.] Dewey clearly has no conception of
                    American sentiment and puts his foot in his mouth every time he opens it." Always the
                    professional, Bowers admitted to Farley that it was not up to the 
                        United States
                     to get into the European war, but he remained concerned that the Axis powers were
                    seeking to limit U.S. influence in South America and to shut the U.S. "out from the markets
                    here." He noted that if any attempt was made to "smash" the 
                        Monroe
                     Doctrine the 
                        United States
                     must defend itself and added, "it looks more and more that we will have to
                        fight."30
            
            As busy as Bowers was with diplomatic crises, he still found time for politics, and it was apparent
                    that his friendship with Farley was as close as ever. On more than one occasion he asked Farley to
                    "send him the news," and he continued to write speeches and offer political
                    advice. Farley, for his part, had plenty of news to send Bowers, for following the 1936 election a
                    number of political controversies arose in the administration.
            One of the most controversial issues in Roosevelt's second administration concerned the
                    president's proposed plan to reorganize the Supreme Court. According to this proposal, the
                    chief executive would be given the power to appoint additional justices, up to six, for every judge
                    over seventy who did not retire. Roosevelt's "bombshell" announcement in
                    February, 1937, was in response to a number of rulings from the high court, which had invalidated
                    several pieces of New Deal legislation including the Agricultural Adjustment Act and National
                    Industrial Recovery Act. Believing that the court had become too old and conservative and opposed to
                    the will of the people, Roosevelt proposed legislation that many referred to as the "court
                    packing" bill.31
            
            Farley's chief tasks were to court traditional Democrats and deliver speeches to various
                    groups around the country to drum up support for the court reorganization measure. Again, however,
                    his responsibilities were limited, further demonstrating the president's reservations about
                    the party chairman's political effectiveness. Farley was not made part of the initial
                    "strategy" group organized to lobby for the bill; indeed, he was not even notified
                    about the plan until just before it was announced publicly. Still, Roosevelt realized that
                    Farley's contacts with party leaders would be important in

                    initially perturbed at not being notified beforehand, Farley loyally backed his president.32
            
            Despite the controversy and debate Farley optimistically informed Bowers that the bill would pass. He
                    was confident that the administration had fifty-two key votes in the Senate, which would enable them
                    to defeat any attempt on the part of the opposition to offer compromises or amendments. He was
                    convinced that the public favored the president and the "battle would be won."
                    Bowers concurred with Farley and was equally optimistic. He noted 
                  
                     32 Farley, Jim Farley's Story, 73; on the

                     that the opposition was "much like the fight on the
                    policies before the election. The same people, the same reason." He added, "it
                    cannot be done and probably should not, but if one were to merely publish the pre-bench history of
                    the majority of the Justices, showing that they were corporation employees in most cases, the
                    country would be enlightened."33
            
            As much as Farley related to Bowers about the affair, he failed to tell the ambassador that he was
                    becoming disillusioned with the court battle and equally frustrated with members of the
                    president's strategy group who believed Farley was not committed to the measure and was not
                    doing all he could to get it passed. The group found the party chairman's speechmaking and
                    boastful optimism that the measure would pass ineffective; and when Farley made public an
                    off-the-record remark intimating that patronage and favors might be withheld from Democratic
                    senators not supporting the bill, dissatisfaction grew. It was a further indication that
                    Farley's way of conducting party affairs was considered dated in the new era of liberal
                        politics.34
            
            In July hopes for passing the Supreme Court bill were dealt a severe blow when the Senate majority
                    leader, Joseph T. Robinson, suffered a fatal heart attack. His death, coming at a critical juncture,
                    spelled the end of the measure. Before the bill could be brought to a vote, the Senate returned it
                    to committee, then adjourned for the summer. Farley confided to Bowers that he believed the bill
                    would have passed had Robinson not died. The majority leader's ability to keep Democrats
                    loyal to the measure assured victory, he claimed, but senators deserted their position following
                    Robinson's death. Farley added that the president would likely bring the bill up again at
                    another time and that FDR was taking the defeat in "splendid fashion."35
            
            Following the court-packing controversy, Farley's close relationship with Roosevelt
                    continued to deteriorate. Compounding their difficulties was the fact that Farley's name
                    repeatedly cropped up in public opinion polls concerning who would be the Democratic presidential
                    nominee in 1940. Farley's correspondence with Bowers from 1938 through 1940 reflected the
                    growing tension between the president and his party chairman. Farley sought Bowers's
                    counsel on how to handle the situation, and his letters took on a more personal note. Farley was
                    especially upset over individuals such as Secretary of the Interior Ickes, who had "no
                    regard for party loyalty or what has happened in former days." Farley and Ickes had not

                     gotten along during their tenure in the Cabinet, and their
                    problems worsened as Farley's relationship with Roosevelt declined. Farley noted he was
                    trying to "keep things on an even keel with fellows like Ickes" and that all he
                    could do would be to make the best of the situation.36
            
            The 1938 congressional election was a special source of tension for Farley. Roosevelt's
                    decision to "purge" several conservative Democratic senators and congressmen, who
                    he felt had thwarted his legislation, by campaigning against them in the spring primary did not sit
                    well with Farley who believed such action would damage party unity. Farley refused to take part in
                    the campaigns with the notable exception of the contest in 
                        Maryland
                     where he made some effort to try to defeat Millard Tydings. His lack of support for the
                    "purge" distanced him further from the administration.37
            
            The Democrats lost a number of seats in Congress in 1938, and Farley believed the election mirrored
                    the party's difficulties and tensions. He confided to Bowers that the losses of Governor
                    Martin L. Davey and Senator Robert Bulkley in 
                        Ohio
                     resulted from their "stupidity." Davey had done nothing to heal the
                    "wounds of a bitter primary battle"; and Bulkley refused to identify with
                    Roosevelt and elected to debate his opponent, Robert Taft, who was noted to be a good orator. Most
                    of all, Farley was displeased with the purge. He was especially frustrated by remarks made by
                    "over zealous fellows who have no knowledge of the activities of our men in the past. Some
                    of the most decent fellows, to my mind are being unfairly opposed." These were some of the
                    same men, confided Farley, who were so helpful to the Roosevelt cause in 1932.38
            
            In June, 1939, Farley told Bowers that he would like to sit down with him and go over the entire
                    situation, especially the still nagging question of the 1940 nomination and his future in the
                    Roosevelt administration. He needed to know what position he should take and "wanted the
                    advice of a real friend." Later that year Bowers and Farley did have the opportunity to
                    talk matters over when Bowers returned to the 
                        United States
                     before leaving for his new post in 
                        Chile
                    . Farley confided to the ambassador that he had lost the president's
                    confidence, that he was no longer consulted on issues, and that when he brought up the question of
                    the 1940 Democratic nomination Roosevelt was evasive. Bowers counseled Farley not to act hastily. He
                    noted that Farley had the confidence of

                     all party workers down to the precinct level and that his
                    resignation would be misinterpreted by party workers. Farley agreed to withhold his resignation
                    until after the 1940 convention.39 Neither Bowers nor Farley realized or
                    discussed the real issue of Farley's problem; namely, that they had become "old
                    Democrats" in a new era of politics which no longer held sacrosanct the time-honored values
                    of party loyalty and regularity.
            Farley continued to pursue his dream of securing the Democratic nomination in 1940, but he was
                    continually frustrated by Roosevelt's evasiveness on whether he would break precedent and
                    run for a third term. The principal target of Farley's frustrations was presidential
                    advisor "Tommy Corcoran and that group" who had persuaded him to withhold any
                    statement concerning the nomination until later. Unable to launch an effective campaign until
                    Roosevelt made his intentions known, Farley remained disillusioned. He confessed to Bowers that many
                    viewed a potential ticket of Secretary of State Hull for president and Farley for vice-president as
                    a winning combination but added that "no man ever got anywhere running for Vice
                    President." He also believed that many opposed his candidacy because he was Catholic. He
                    concluded one letter by saying, "very frankly and confidentially Claude, if it
                    weren't for my religion there wouldn't be any question that I would be the
                    deciding factor."40 Bowers was supportive of his friend, but he was
                    careful not to say anything that would give Farley false hope. He told Farley that he understood his
                    predicament, but he could also see the president's position in not making his plans known.
                    "Whenever it becomes clear that a man in his second term is out he usually loses all
                    control of the Congress." He did say, however, that if Roosevelt did not run, then
                    "I think you have it right–it would be Hull and Farley."41
            
            Farley's presidential ambitions and his friendship with Bowers may have impacted
                    Bowers's relationship with Roosevelt as well. Knowing that the two men were friends and
                    frequent correspondents, Roosevelt by 1940 had cooled in his relationship with Bowers. The
                    ambassador noted to Farley that he did not know what the president's ambitions were.
                    "I hear from him very infrequently and then very briefly and impersonally. There was a time
                    when he was more personal in his letters to me, but not during the last two years."42
            
            When the Democratic National Convention convened in July, 1940, Roosevelt successfully secured the
                    nomination for president

                     for an unprecedented third term. Farley's name was
                    placed in nomination, and he received 72V2 votes from the 
                        Massachusetts
                     and 
                        New York
                     delegations. Graciously, Farley addressed the convention and asked that the nomination
                    of Roosevelt be supported by unanimous acclamation. Despite attempts by both the president and
                    Eleanor Roosevelt to encourage him to remain party chairman, he submitted his resignation as
                    chairman and as postmaster general. He confided to Bowers, "I did what I thought was best
                    and I have no apologies and no regrets. My conscience is clear."43
            
            Bowers did his best to patch up differences between Roosevelt and Farley during the succeeding years.
                    In September, 1943, while home from his diplomatic duties in 
                        Chile
                    , the ambassador talked with Roosevelt and mentioned that he was going to 
                        New York
                     and was going to see Farley. Bowers was concerned about reports that Farley, who was
                    still Democratic chairman in 
                        New York
                    , might bolt the ticket and support the Republican candidate if Roosevelt were the
                    nominee in 1944. Roosevelt encouraged Bowers, who said he would report back to the president on his
                    meeting. Following his talk, Bowers related to Roosevelt that Farley was still upset over
                    Roosevelt's intervention in the 1942 gubernatorial race in 
                        New York
                     where both men supported different candidates in the primary. This controversy had led
                    to a divided Democratic party and an eventual Republican victory in the fall election. Bowers added
                    that Farley had told him that "he thought Roosevelt still liked him," to which
                    Roosevelt replied with a smile, "I've always been fond of Jim." Bowers
                    concluded by stating that he was not sure what Farley would do in 1944 but accurately predicted that
                    he would not bolt the ticket. Roosevelt then asked Bowers what he thought of his appointing Farley
                    as director of the Relief and Rehabilitation Commission, a post that was soon to be vacated by
                    Herbert Lehman of 
                        New York
                    . Bowers encouraged Roosevelt to do so, but the position was never offered. A somewhat
                    embittered Farley would later write, "the most cruel thing he did, Claude, was not
                    permitting me to participate in the war effort."44
            
            In the years following the war Bowers and Farley continued their close friendship. Farley, who became
                    an executive with Coca-Cola Export Company, traveled to 
                        Chile
                     in early 1941 as part of a trip through South America, and he returned there at least
                    two more times in 1947 and 1951. In one letter following his 1941 visit Farley answered
                    Bowers's kind compliments by saying, "I have always considered you one of my real
                    friends." Bowers, in turn, saw Farley on his visits back to the 
                        United States
                    , and the two continued

                     to do each other favors. When the Chilean delegates to the newly
                    formed United Nations gathered in 
                        San Francisco
                    , Farley hosted a dinner for them. In September of that same year the president of 
                        Chile
                     was honored by the Pan American Society in 
                        New York
                    , and not surprisingly it was Farley who was chosen to give the welcoming address.
                    Bowers also continued to act as a speechwriter for Farley. As late as 1952, with the election
                    campaign set to begin, Farley asked his friend, "if between now and then you would have
                    time to grind out a couple of speeches for me that would be satisfactory for a gathering or over the
                    radio." As always, Bowers sent Farley the speeches and graciously offered to do more if
                        necessary.45 Although their correspondence was not as frequent as in the
                    1930s, their letters continued until 1957, a year before Bowers's death.
            The frequent correspondence and close friendship between Claude Bowers and Jim Farley during the
                    1930s reveals the political changes occurring within the Democratic party and the rapidly developing
                    events in foreign affairs which influenced American foreign policy in the years leading up to World
                    War II. The letters portray two older, traditional Democrats, guided by notions of party loyalty and
                    regularity, caught up in a period of political realignment. For Farley these changes proved
                    especially difficult to perceive or understand, and his letters indicate the frustration of an
                    advisor whose influence was waning. Bowers experienced similar frustrations, especially regarding
                    America's role in the Spanish Civil War and Roosevelt's tolerance and willingness
                    to accept a fascist leader in 
                        Spain
                    . Moral diplomacy had been supplanted by a more pragmatic and expedient approach to
                    policymaking in the turbulent Europe of the 1930s, and Bowers found this a bitter pill to swallow.
            Clinging to their long-established values and principles in a new era of politics and diplomacy,
                    Bowers and Farley found solace in each other's friendship. Two men who helped shape party
                    strategy and lay the foundation for Roosevelt's success in the early New Deal years, they
                    had become by 1940 two "old Democrats," outsiders whose time had passed but whose
                    loyalties and commitment to the party remained as firm as ever.

            "Things have sunk lower than a snake's belly" [a popular comment by Red
                    Skelton's Clem Kadiddlehopper].
            Newspaper journalist John Crosby in 1952: "How [comically] stupid can you get?"
            Skelton: "I don't know. I'm still pretty young."1
            
            From the books of George Ade, Kin Hubbard, and Will Cuppy to the television work of Herb Shriner and
                    David Letterman, Indiana's humor has long entertained the nation. But Red
                    Skelton's more-than-fifty-year reign as a Hoosier comedy artist of national significance
                    and his ongoing ties to the state–particularly as his character Clem
                    Kadiddlehopper–place him in a peerless position among Indiana comedians. Since the 1930s
                    Red, fittingly, has achieved success in every medium that he has attempted, including vaudeville,
                    radio, television, and motion pictures. The cornerstone of the comedian's career is the
                    unprecedented twenty-year television run (1951–1971) of his variety show.
            All artists' backgrounds provide special insights into their work, but there seems to be a
                    unique fascination with the biographies of humorists. Clowns comically comfort audiences with their
                    physical and spiritual resilience. In addition, society seems especially spellbound with the clown
                    chronicle that reveals tragic roots–the ability to provoke laughter despite personal
                    sadness. Once again Skelton is in a unique category among Indiana humorists, for he survived the
                    harshest of childhoods. His circus clown father died an alcohol-related death before Red was born,
                    and as a youth he endured tattered clothing, taunts about his

            The carrot-topped future comedian arrived July 18, 1913, in 
                        Vincennes
                    , Indiana, his mother, Ida Mae, christening him Richard Bernard, though his friends
                    would soon rename him Red. There were also three older Skelton brothers, so Ida put in long hours as
                    a cleaning lady at the local vaudeville house. In 1941 Red observed, "My earliest memories
                    are of my mother fighting desperately to keep her family together with a roof overhead and something
                    to eat on the table."3 One of Red's boyhood friends described
                    the Skelton family as being "so poor they didn't have a pot to pee in or a window
                    to throw it out of."4 Another childhood acquaintance remembers her
                    sister's having to stop a teenage romance with the impoverished Red because he allegedly
                    had no future.5 In 1947 the comedian recalled doing odd jobs at an early age
                    because "the family was hungry."6 He did everything from
                    selling newspapers to racking balls at the local poolroom. Yet young Red had time to horse around
                    with friends and to try all those early rite-of-passage things small-town boys once did, such as
                    stealing watermelons and getting sick from smoking green tobacco.
            Skelton's youth represented a time when American humor was undergoing a transition from
                    emphasis on the rural, capable, crackerbarrel figure to the urban, comic antihero. For example, one
                    might contrast the down-home wisdom of a Will Rogers with the comic vulnerability of Robert
                    Benchley's overwhelmed little man. In the nineteenth century the crackerbarrel
                    character–traditionally focused on political involvement, rural residency, the fatherly
                    image, employment, and success –dominated American humor. If and when an antihero
                    appeared, his comic frustration usually resulted from a failure to follow the commonsense model of
                    his crackerbarrel counterpart. By early in the twentieth century, however, American comedy tastes
                    began to find an increased affinity with the urban antihero–nonpolitical, childlike,
                    leisure-oriented, and frustrated. The difficulties of modern urban life began to be reflected
                    throughout comedic popular culture, from the cartoon strips of George Herriman ("Krazy
                    Kat") to vaudeville comedy as performed by Ed Wynn in his fool persona.7

                  7 For a brief discussion of the transition in American humor from the
                        crackerbarrel figure to urban antihero, see Wes D. Gehring, "Kin Hubbard's Abe
                        Martin: A Figure of Transition in American Humor," Indiana Magazine of
                            History, LXXVIII (March, 1982), 26-37.
            
            
            Two Hoosier humorists, George Ade (1866–1944) and Frank McKinney "Kin"
                    Hubbard (1868-1930), were instrumental in the evolution of this transition on a national level. Ade
                    is best remembered for his Fables in Slang, which, like their often flippant
                    morals, might better be described as sketches in colloquial language. These short pieces were comic
                    close-ups of the quaint and unusual aspects of what others would merely see as the drab and/or
                    trivial everyday world. Like James Thurber's later fables, Ade's antiheroic comedy
                    toyed with a world view of rather frightening randomness. Hubbard's career is best known
                    for the crackerbarrel figure Abe Martin, who reached great national popularity after receiving
                    Ade's strong support. While Ade's fables closed with a comic moral,
                    Hubbard's Martin material began and ended with a brief humorous axiom that ranged from
                    comic insight to absurdity. Martin was more wise crackerbarrel figure than fool, but he became
                    progressively more antiheroic from the 1910s on.8
            
            Coincidental with the appearance of the urban antihero in American humor there developed a literary
                    movement often denned as "the revolt from the village." Beginning with the
                    publication of Edgar Lee Master's 
                  Spoon River
                    Anthology (1915) and Sherwood Anderson's Winesburg, 
                            Ohio
                        
                (1919), the movement actively attacked small-town life and received its
                    greatest boost from the 1920s satirical fiction of Sinclair Lewis, starting with his novel Main Street. This revolt against village and farm life was best portrayed in
                    period films by W. C. Fields's small-town, henpecked anti-heroes. Skelton's early
                    years, then, paralleled the comic and literary decline of the wise rustic, who was replaced more and
                    more with the urban antihero or the often befuddled rural/small-town character.
            Be this as it may, the young Red would do anything for a laugh,9 and, like most
                    comedians, he became a student of the people around him.10 In fact, the most
                    fascinating aspect of Skelton's gift of humor, besides the sheer joy of laughter that it
                    provides, is the diversity of his comedy types. His characters represent a cross section of American
                    humor, from the mime of Freddie the Freeloader, his Chap-linesque tramp, to his bombastic con-man
                    politician, San Fernando Red. Skelton's one-man band of comedy also includes the Mean
                    Widdle Kid (whose "I Dood It" crack became a national catchphrase in the early
                    1940s); punch-drunk boxer Cauliflower McPugg; and

                            early gags, which involved Skelton's very tiny dog. "He would put it
                            between two slices of bread and tell everyone he had a hot dog." Brenda Grant,

                                Muncie
                            , Indiana, September 18, 1986. This conversation occurred after Ball State
                            University had conferred an honorary Doctorate of Humanities upon the comedian.
               
                     Sheriff Deadeye, who was anything but a deadeye. The Skelton
                    figure seemingly closest to Red's Indiana background, however, is Clem Kadiddlehopper, an
                    archetype of the country bumpkin, a character more crackers than cracker barrel, but still an
                    affectionate parody of the rural rustic.
            In terms of Skelton's entertainment work, his first radio success was directly tied to his
                    ability to play a comic country bumpkin such as Clem. His debut was in January of 1938 on the Red Foley Show, which was broadcast locally over station WLW in
                            
                  Cincinnati, Ohio
               .11 Foley's show was a weekly
                    half-hour country-western program with Skelton providing the rustic comedy relief. Red was so
                    popular that within a few months he had his own radio program out of 
                        NBC
                    in 
                        Chicago
                    . It was not yet a national hook-up, but the comedian was clearly on his way.
            While Skelton soon developed a repertoire of characters, by the late 1940s the figure that was
                    invariably first associated with his work was Clem. For instance, before Ozzie and Harriet Nelson
                    had a popular 1940s radio program that successfully moved to 1950s television, they doubled as both
                    the musical support and straight "men" on Skelton's first nationwide
                    radio program, Red Skelton's Scrapbook of Satire (1942). When Harriet was
                    later interviewed about these years, the first of only two of Skelton's characters that she
                    discussed was Kadiddlehopper (the other being Junior–the Mean Widdle Kid).12 Harriet played Clem's girlfriend, Daisy June.
            When one examines Skelton's move to television in 1951, the significance of Clem (among all
                    his characters) is further underlined. The extensive Skelton files in the Billy Rose Special
                    Collection in the 
                        New York
                     Public Library at Lincoln Center fully document Kadiddlehopper's importance in
                    the comedian's repertoire.13 In an article in the 
                        New York
                    
                    Morning Telegraph on Red's concern about his September 30, 1951,
                    television debut, Skelton observed, "I'll still be the same kind of
                    clown." He then proceeded to lead off his discussion of comedy characters with
                    Kadiddlehopper; and when the show business bible, Variety, later reviewed the
                    program, special attention was given to "Clem, the squirt from the milk barn." The
                    following season, after Skelton had won 1951 Emmy awards for both "Best Comedy
                    Show" and "Best Comedian," radio and television critic John Crosby
                    suggested that the comedian's characters were "all pretty much alike,"
                    with the basic model being the "imbecilic Clem Kadiddlehopper." Still later,
                    astute entertainer/ author Steve Allen included a chapter on Skelton in his acclaimed critical study
                        The Funny Men (1956). Clem was again the

                     first of only two of Red's characters to be discussed
                    (the other was Cauliflower McPugg). When Skelton did a television special from 
                        Miami Beach
                    's famous Fountainbleau Hotel in the 1950s, he opened the show with Clem, who
                    drove "his ancient car up the circular driveway to the hotel's overwhelming
                    entrance, and made his awe-struck way across the lobby." A review of the special pointed
                    out Clem's everyman nature with its undercrust of pathos, "the sad-funny plight of
                    the man who is out of his element, and only half suspects it. It is the characteristic Skelton
                    humor, the universal appeal of a universal comedian."14
            
            Unlike most television comedians in the 1950s, Skelton, through his star character, Clem, dealt in
                    humor that had its roots in rural/small-town America. This focus was decidedly not true of such
                    contemporaries as 
                        Milton
                     Berle, Bob Hope, Sid Caesar, Ernie Kovacs, Jackie Gleason, Henny Youngman, or Jack
                    Carter. Even those with a comedy arsenal of characters (such as Caesar, Kovacs, and Gleason) had
                    nothing quite like Clem. Kovacs's figures tended to be intellectually surreal, such as his
                    gay poet Percy Dovetonsils, while Gleason was at his best as 
                        Brooklyn
                     blue-collar loudmouth Ralph Kramden. Even Gleason's silent antiheroic
                    character, the Poor Soul, was an urban misfit. And Caesar, though a gifted mime, excelled at
                    phonetic comedy; thus, his greatest figures had foreign roots, such as his fraudulent know-it-all
                    professor with the German accent.
            Those period stand-up comics who had a bucolic slant, such as Cliff Arquette with Charlie Weaver,
                    George Gobel and his smalltown, self-described "brown-shoe type," or even
                    Indiana's Herb Shriner did not have the uniqueness of Red's Clem. Moreover, unlike
                    Skelton, they did not have a cast of other characters with whom to avoid overexposure. Indeed, even
                    when Skelton's variety show was later canceled, his ratings were high. He was a victim of
                    demographics: his many viewers tended to be older people from small-town/rural markets when it
                    became network strategy to court the buying power of the urban young adult.
            Possibly the ultimate tribute to the uniqueness of Skelton's popular and pivotal Clem is
                    that other performers seemed unable or unwilling to create similar characters of their own even
                    though other successful yet lesser Skelton characters were "borrowed." San
                    Fernando Red was an obvious model for Johnny Carson's later huckster TV matinee host, Art
                    Fern; and Red Buttons's television variety show in the 1950s featured a punch-drunk boxer,
                    Rocky Buttons, who was more than a little like Skelton's Cauliflower McPugg.

            The significance of Clem has continued through the years. Red's busy concert schedule (as
                    late as 1991 he was doing seventy-five shows a year) still finds Kadiddlehopper as the character who
                    logs the most stage time. In his later years the multitalented Skelton also composed "the
                    Kadiddlehopper March" for concert bands. The song was published by the Sam Fox company,
                    copyright owners of several John Philip Sousa marches.
            Equally as significant as Clem's unique status in Skelton's career are the
                    character's special Indiana ties. At a Ball State University Homecoming program in October,
                    1991, Skelton called Kadiddlehopper a citizen of his 
                        Vincennes
                     birthplace,15 a comment that took a fascinating twist two years
                    later when writer Brenda Grant, the daughter of Carl Hopper, a boyhood friend of the comedian,
                    privately suggested that her father might have been a model, or at least a starting point, for
                    Red's Clem.16
            
            The Hoppers were 
                        Vincennes
                     neighbors of the Skeltons. Both families were poor and comprised of male children.
                    Carl, two years younger than Red, suffered from a severe hearing loss, which caused many to consider
                    him not quite "all there." This misconception resulted in cruel putdowns when Carl
                    misunderstood what people said and replied with under-his-breath asides and a patented
                    "Huh?" Even Carl's parents felt that there was no need for him to receive
                    an education; consequently, Hopper acquired a lifetime habit of butchering the English language. His
                    high-pitched voice was also a result of his hearing loss. Despite these problems Carl remained a
                    remarkably upbeat farm boy who was especially taken with wearing hats and laughing at his own
                        jokes.17
            
            Red was a rare friend among those often mean faces, probably as a result of both his lifelong
                    everyman nature and the fact that as the youngest of Ida Mae's boys he had often been
                    picked on by his older brothers. Regardless, the future comedian made it a point to include Carl in
                    group activities. Red also nicknamed him "Kadiddle," possibly playing upon the
                    slang definition of "diddle," which meant idling away one's time. Perhaps
                    to make Carl's inclusion palatable to the other boys, Skelton periodically did an
                    affectionately comic imitation of his friend; but that was just Red, someone who was forever
                    "on," even as a child. Carl never found this offensive. Indeed, he was proud to
                    generate this extra attention from his advocate.18

                  18 A comment by critic Leo Roster in the early 1950s nicely suggests how
                        the young Red could inoffensively have done such an imitation: "He has insight and
                        compassion and a kindly respect for those who are not quite ‘all there’
                        [be it naive or slow-witted]. To imitate … [them] without malice or derision is quite
                        a feat–and Skelton brings it off every time." Quoted in Marx, Red Skelton, 170.

            These facts do not prove–or even suggest–that Skelton took his Clem character
                    full-blown from a childhood friend, who later through ear surgery and a hearing aid achieved a
                    successful adult career; but no artist, however talented, operates in a vacuum. Thus, the Carl
                    "Kadiddle" Hopper-Clem Kadiddlehopper parallel merits further attention. Both
                    figures appear to be inordinately happy, illiterate rural rubes, forever fracturing the language and
                    mumbling things under their breath. Their voice patterns are funny in part because they are pitched
                    higher than the norm. They laugh at their own jokes and are associated with hats (two things that
                    apply to most Skelton characters). Though it has not been recorded that  deafness caused Carl to cup a hand around his ear, Clem sometimes did
                    so.
            Since Skelton's Clem would occasionally say or do something surprisingly correct, the
                    devil's advocate might claim that the comedian's character was merely drawn from
                    the oldest and most universal comedy type, the wise fool. This character is synonymous with the
                    court jester of the Middle Ages who would deliver unpopular truths behind a mask of incompetency,
                    that of the fool. What makes Clem's character unique to Indiana is that any variation of
                    the wise fool uses his immediate surroundings as a stage for the comedy. The archetype jester
                    performed for a royal court, and his colorful costume, like his allegedly foolish pronouncements,
                    were a send-up of the elaborate rituals practiced by the aristocracy, be they in wardrobe or war.
                    Although, in contrast, Clem's Hoosier is closer to being a common man–some might
                    say very common–he is a modestly dressed, often vulnerable, rural/small-town figure whose
                    audiences were frequently from the same background. The jester's elaborately veiled
                    comments were meant to safeguard him in the always treacherous royal court; Red shielded
                    Clem's occasional insight in the common sense prized by his listeners. Given the close
                    proximity of Clem's 
                        Vincennes
                     to 
                        Brown
                     County, the home of Kin Hubbard's fictional Abe Martin, one could indeed spin
                    an Indiana wise fool hypothesis.
            Martin, as has been indicated, was more wise crackerbarrel figure than fool, but the characters with
                    whom Hubbard populated his 
                        Brown
                     County had more than a little in common with a rube like Clem. And occasionally Hubbard
                    gifted them with insight, just as his Martin became progressively more antiheroic through the
                        years.19 In fact, 
                        New York
                    
                    Herald Tribune critic John Crosby placed Skelton's character in a time
                    frame that paralleled Hubbard's formative years: "Clem Kadiddlehopper is a rustic
                    of rococo design not seen in these parts since the 1880's."20
            
            Not all Indiana humorists are linked to some old-fashioned down-home tradition, of course, and there
                    are famous Hoosier entertainers whose work and wit are anything but rustic. In the field of music,
                    in particular, the sophisticated compositions of Cole Porter and the jazz patter of bandleader/actor
                    Phil Harris are cases in point. Even in this area, however, the state's celebrated
                    composer/actor Hoagy Carmichael projected a decidedly old-fashioned, nonrushed wisdom in his
                    character actor asides.
            Perhaps no one will ever know just how much Skelton's boyhood friend influenced the later
                    Clem Kadiddlehopper, especially since the comedian (as is true of many gifted artists) is reluctant
                    to

                     divulge sources that contributed to his success.21 Whatever the Hopper factor, which would seem considerable given Skelton's 1991
                    affirmation of the 
                        Vincennes
                     tie and Grant's recollections about her father, there are other probable
                    influences on the creation of Clem. Most obvious would be Red's boyhood encounter with the
                    vaudeville performer Ed Wynn. This pivotal pioneer in the new antiheroic humor played 
                        Vincennes
                    's Pantheon Theater in the early 1920s. Wynn befriended the young, raggedly
                    clothed, street-corner newspaper hawker and gave him a ticket to the evening show. Initially Skelton
                    did not know the identity of the stranger, but he was soon impressed both by who his benefactor was
                    and what a wonderful occupation he had. At this time Wynn was best known for his "Perfect
                    Fool" act, which had him fumbling over his language and his comic props. The humor came
                    from the character's alleged overea-gerness to perform successfully a given physical trick.
                    His ongoing failures were both funny and endearing, traits that also describe the later Clem,
                    including the propensity for pathos. Moreover, Wynn's fool enjoyed bringing his character
                    off the stage, from wishing departing audience members good-night to just being amusingly
                    ineffective in whatever the situation. Skelton frequently employs the same tactics in his stage act.
                    For instance, before his show starts, he enjoys announcing nonsense neighborhood traffic reports
                    over the public address system.
            If Wynn contributed to the entertainingly foolish actions of Skelton's Clem,
                    Hubbard's Abe Martin possibly helped define the look of Red's special character.
                    Young Skelton sold papers at a time when Abe's comic axioms were syndicated both throughout
                    Indiana and the 
                        United States
                     in general. More importantly, however, each Abe moral included a Hubbard drawing of
                    farmer Martin in clownish clothing. Such garb symbolized the growing antiheroic tendencies of
                    Martin's crackerbarrel figure. Teenage rube performer Skelton, as a prototype Clem, would
                    wear a similar costume in his early stage work. Like Martin's, Red's outfit
                    consisted of a misshapen hat, oversized coat, mismatched tight pants, and extra large shoes.
            However one defines Clem's roots, the character is uniquely different from
                    Skelton's other creations. Clem came first and is most obviously tied to an Indiana
                    background. He is also the only player 
                  
                     21 At a Ball State University press conference in September, 1986, for
                            example, Skelton denied having been influenced by Chaplin, someone he had readily credited
                            in the past and who obviously inspired Freddie the Freeloader. The most celebrated Freddie
                            routine is borrowed directly from Chaplin's Modern Times. The
                            sketch finds a hungry tramp anxious for the security and comfort to be found in a short jail
                            term. The inspired ticket to incarceration is ordering and eating in an expensive restaurant
                            without any money. Perhaps, however, Red's denial was one more, though indirect,
                            Chaplin influence. Early in his career Chaplin credited French film comedy pioneer Max
                            Linder with having stimulated his own clown artistry, a statement he denied in later
                        years.
               
                     from a rural/small-town background, if one discounts the rather
                    superficially drawn Sheriff Deadeye–the cowboy coward. Clem's rustic slant,
                    despite his buffoonery, connects him with a rural American tradition upon which the country was
                    founded. Jefferso-nian democracy celebrated the independent farmer over the compromised urbanite. To
                    know nature was to know God. And even rural naivete was once heralded as representing an idealism
                    that had no thought of deceit. It was fitting, then, that an early archetype of Clem led to
                    Red's first success on radio and that the figure was pivotal to his transition into TV
            Red's artistry, like that of many other clowns, is in adding an affectionate comic
                    distortion to real people and/or things that most individuals pass by. This special entertainment
                    vision also reminds audiences how much art can cost and persuades them that it is worth the price.
                    The popularity of Red's Clem, the wise fool, also gifts Carl (a lifelong Skelton fan) and
                    other viewers with a minor victory over life's day-to-day frustrations, a victory possibly
                    not otherwise achieved.

            That history written in the middle of the last century should displease a modern reader is hardly
                    surprising. But to be told that an author fostered "an ideology of divisiveness and hate
                    based on racism, bigotry, misogyny, authoritarianism, chauvinism, and upper-class
                        arrogance"1 not only arrests one's attention, it strikes
                    at the very integrity of the writer and his work. Was the nineteenth century so morally benighted as
                    to generate such an affront to human decency? The culprit here is Francis Parkman, and his
                    antagonist is Francis Jennings. This sweeping indictment might be easily dismissed as a case of
                    hyper-anachronism that treats Park-man as though he were a politically incorrect inhabitant of the
                    cur-rent era, when he was, in fact, a historian of the nineteenth century, an age with a much
                    different conception of the human situation. Indeed, it would be strange if Parkman had not been
                    guilty of some of these postmodern offenses against liberal rectitude. Still, if his language is
                    intemperate and his conception of virtue cramped, Jennings does broach an important question. Can
                    Parkman be read now with any confidence that his account of the past will reflect what actually
                    occurred? Or is his work merely a particularly apt example of mid-nineteenth century romantic prose,
                    revealing of the ideas and sensibilities of that era but hardly worthy of the exacting standards
                    that ought to inform modern historical writing?

                     in North America. The series eventually covered the whole of the
                    imperial conflict between the two great powers, a contest that began in the seventeenth century and
                    did not conclude until 1763 when the French lost their hold on North America. Pontiac served as a kind of epilogue in which Parkman treated the last desperate effort of the
                    Indians of the Northwest to reconstitute the balance of power that had through the eighteenth
                    century contributed so much to the preservation of their way of life. He told a good story; but was
                    it true?
            Parkman's merits and defects are patent even in Pontiac, the first written
                    though actually an epilogue to the series. Few modern authors can command the sweep of his history.
                    He could invest seemingly minor frontier events with the quality of an epic. His major characters,
                    Pontiac and Henry Bouquet, are drawn to a heroic design, the forest setting brooding with life and
                    expectation as the plot unfolds. Seen as a whole, the struggle between 
                        France
                     and Britain for the continent can be portrayed in epic dimensions, but the contest
                    between the western tribes and the English in the early 1760s seems hardly to merit that
                    description. That Parkman can pull it off testifies to the enduring American habit of depicting the
                    West with the aura of myth but more directly to the author's greatness as a craftsman of
                    historical narrative. Although writing in a language and style alien to our own time,
                    Parkman's appeal may even now be in this genius for raising the commonplace to the heroic.
                    But, of course, the modern age also sees itself as free of illusions, and here Parkman is unlikely
                    to please. As with many of his contemporary practitioners of literary history, George Bancroft,
                    William H. Prescott, John Lothrop Motley, Parkman's images often lie thick on the page. The
                    reader must slog through a sea of elaborately contrived metaphors that tend to obscure the story as
                    often as they clarify it. Inevitably, one wonders whether the scene painting so important to the
                    romantic style does not do a certain violence to the reality. Parkman maynot be guilty of creating
                    events (at least not often), but he is too often the inventor of the setting in which the events
                    occur and which is essential in shaping his plot. The romantic wilderness lends a certain fictional
                    air to the quite mundane struggle of Indians, soldiers, and settlers in the region south of the
                    Lakes.
            All of this ought to be enough to make the reader cautious. Pontiac may be good
                    reading, but it is also a period piece. In what sense it is or is not good history is a more
                    complicated question. If we are to believe Jennings, Parkman's work suffers from a good
                    deal more than a failure to keep up with the times. He accuses the 
                        Boston
                     Brahmin of falsifying the historical record in order to support his nefarious depiction
                    of the native people. Jennings's favorite specimen (he uses it twice) comes from Montcalm and Wolfe, where Parkman describes a visit to the 
                        Ohio
                     tribes undertaken in 1758 by  Christian Post, a
                    Moravian missionary. Parkman, according to Jennings, ignores the significant role of Post's
                    Indian companion, Pis-quetomen, hence exaggerates the part played by Post, makes the Indians into
                    the villains of the piece, and underplays the danger presented to Post by the French.
                    Parkman's treatment of the episode might, of course, be a misinterpretation of the events
                    without being a deliberate effort to slander the Indians. But Jennings much prefers skulduggery to
                    mistakes or even wrong-headed error. David Levin takes the same passage from Post's journal
                    and makes a strong case for the Parkman interpretation, showing at the same time that by
                    Jennings's standard of judgment he might himself be as guilty as he thinks Parkman.
                    Parkman, it would seem, was not more inclined to mangle his sources than any other
                    nineteenth-century historian or indeed many historians of our own time.2
            
            But Pontiac does contain a source problem, one that casts doubt on the thesis of
                    the book. Parkman asserts that in 1762 Pontiac sent ambassadors to the western tribes to organize a
                    conspiracy to attack the British forts. In support of his contention he cites a 1764 letter from
                    Sieur d'Abbadie, the French governor at 
                        New Orleans
                    , to Neyon de Villiers who commanded at Fort de Chartres (I, 186) which, according to
                    Wilbur R. Jacobs, no one has succeeded in locating since. In Pontiac and the Indian
                        Uprising Howard H. Peckham cites a letter from d'Abbadie to Neyon dated January
                    30, 1764, but it contains nothing that will establish Parkman's case for a conspiracy. It
                    would appear that his position cannot be justified by modern research. More likely, as most recent
                    historians would argue, Pontiac was the leader of the native people only in the vicinity of 
                        Detroit
                     and responsible for directing the attack on that fort. He was himself part of a larger,
                    though unorganized, movement of the western Indians against the British.3
            
            In a matter of less moment, but perhaps indicative of his proclivity to favor a good story over what
                    research would yield, Park-man placed Pontiac at the head of a band of Ottawas in the French and
                    Indian attack on Edward Braddock (I, 109). Pontiac may indeed have participated in that battle
                    (Parkman qualified his assertion with the phrase "it is said"), but no evidence is
                    cited.

                     Nor have any later historians been able to support
                    Parkman's contention.4
            
            Odd that Parkman should have believed in a unified Indian conspiracy, galvanized by Pontiac, yet
                    missed the importance of Neolin who was probably responsible for whatever concerted effort the
                    warriors brought to bear against the British. Neolin was the 
                        Delaware
                     prophet who lived on the Cuyahoga River south of Lake
                        Erie and in 1762–1763, together with other religious leaders, attempted
                    through his preaching to revitalize the tribes with a syncretic form of older native religious
                    belief and additions of Chris-tianity. There can be no question that this "revitalization
                    movement" lay behind the Indian attempt to drive the British from the western posts.
                    Parkman noted the role of Neolin, but he ranked it as merely one of the many causes of the uprising.
                    He did acknowledge the significance of animism–"nature instinct with
                    deity" (I, 39)–in Indian life, but he saw it as simply more evidence of
                    savagery. Thus he was more inclined to evaluate Neolin and his disciples as merely
                    "frivolous and absurd" (I, 179) rather than important actors in a concerted native
                    assault on British power in the West.5
            
            The activities of the prophets in fomenting the uprising raise yet another problem in
                    Parkman's interpretation. Despite his conception of native life as savage, unstable, and
                    irrational, Parkman argued that the Indians had gone to war for entirely rational reasons. The
                    western tribes had long been Britain's enemies, but when Lord Amherst, at the close of the
                    Seven Years War, ended the traditional practice of supplying the Indians with the goods upon which
                    they had become dependent, they had an immediate reason to oppose the British displacement of the
                    French. In addition, the Indians knew well that a British advance into the 
                        Ohio
                     lands meant their own eventual displacement by settlers as the long French presence for
                    trade and proselytization had not. Finally, though the French had lost the war, their western
                    traders still hoped to retain a hold on the tribes by limiting British competition. Many of the
                    French inhabitants encouraged the uprising (I, 170-80). If Parkman had seen the prophets as a major
                    cause of the conflict, his explanation would at least have taken on a certain symmetry. A savage and
                    irrational people stimulated by an overheated religious revival would have behaved as expected. As
                    it was, his contempt for native religion prevented him from stressing one of the major reasons for
                    the outbreak of war and at the same time verifying his larger conception of native culture.

            Recent interpretations of Pontiac's activities have stressed the importance of native
                    rationality. The Indians, so the story goes, acted as they did because they saw their interests
                    clearly and adopted the measures appropriate for securing those interests. Pontiac's
                    uprising was not a war fought by civilized Europeans against primitive societies hopelessly out of
                    tune with the progress of the world, hence doomed to extinction, but rather a contest between
                    cultural equals that struggled for quite sensible but opposed ends. In this version even the
                    prophets can be interpreted as an expression of a well-integrated religious tradition that
                    functioned to support the survival of native societies, not as an hysterical example of Indian
                    savagery or of people driven to desperation by their inability to cope with powerful invaders whose
                    very presence undermined the stability of native cultures.6
            
            Needless to say Parkman did not share this high opinion of the Indian way of life. In some ways his
                    views were a holdover from the previous century. He conceived of the Indian as part of the raw,
                    untouched continent. For Parkman, as for Thomas Jefferson, the native was "the true child
                    of the forest and the desert. The wastes and solitudes of nature are his true home." Waste,
                    solitude, and "untamed freedom" nurtured a personality of haughtiness and pride,
                    "in harmony with the lonely mountains, cataracts, and rivers … of primitive
                    America, with her savage scenery and savage men …" (I, 1). Parkman could
                    appreciate the sublimity and majesty of the continent, but the Indian struck him as strange,
                    wayward, and ultimately murderous. "Unstable as water, capricious as the winds,
                    … [Indians] seem in some of their moods like ungoverned children fired with the instincts
                    of devils" (II, 298). Furthermore, they were children who would never grow up. He adhered
                    to the vanishing race theory. The continent would change and yield plenty under the cultivation of
                    the farmer and the merchant, but for the Indian there was no hope. "He would not,"
                    Parkman remained convinced, "learn the arts of civilization, and he and his forest must
                    perish together" (I, 44). Unlike Jefferson and his generation, Parkman held out no hope for
                    the native people. "Their intractable, unchanging character leave no other alternative than
                    their gradual extinction." "Sentimental philanthropy" will always fail
                    (II, 158). Thinking as he did, Parkman could find little sympathy for Pontiac's desperate
                    effort to retrieve the Indians' future. The 
                        Ottawa
                     leader was on the wrong side of the human drama, and his actions were not only futile
                    but vicious and dangerous.
            Consequently, it does seem strange that Parkman neglected the one point that might have supported his
                    belief in the ultimate

                     disappearance of the Indians. He wrote little of disease either
                    as a significant factor in the failure of the Indian uprising or as the most important force working
                    to reduce the tribal population. Of course, not even disease would spell the end of the Indian, but
                    it is widely agreed nowadays that it caused a terrible demographic catastrophe in the New World. The
                    story of the vanishing Indian derives from a number of sources in European thinking, most of which
                    have little to do with reality, but it certainly gained credence from what seemed to many to be the
                    inexorable decline in native population. Parkman scarcely mentioned the subject.7
            
            Disease did come up in later editions of Pontiac when evidence appeared that in
                    1763 blankets infected with smallpox may have been given to native emissaries at 
                        Pittsburgh
                     (II, 39-42). In treating the matter Parkman made no connection with the spread of
                    disease among the tribesmen during the uprising or the more general consequences of disease for the
                    native people. His concern was obviously the reputations of the officers involved, should they be
                    guilty of such an inhumane policy. The evidence was irrefutable that both Amherst and Bouquet had
                    proposed the transfer of the blankets. Parkman did at least tell the story in so far as he knew it
                    though his defensiveness detracted from the candor of his account. What he did not know was that the
                    blankets had already been given to the Indians before the suggestions by Amherst and Bouquet reached
                    Fort Pitt. Nor, apparently, did he know that the Indians in the vincity of 
                        Pittsburgh
                     were already suffering from smallpox and that the spread of the contagion would be a
                    significant factor in ending the Indian war.8
            
            Parkman's interpretation may have been dated by his sources, but in one sense his works were
                    quite advanced. In both Pontiac (1851) and the Jesuits of North
                        America (1867), Indians have a central place. Both of these studies begin with an
                    ethnological description of the native world. After publishing Pontiac, Parkman
                    had read Lewis Henry Morgan's League of the Ho-de-no-sau-nee, or Iroquois
                    (1851), a major contribution to the development of modern ethnology. He had already seen
                    Morgan's earlier work on the Iroquois, which he noted in Pontiac (I, 12),
                    but there can be no doubt that his view of Indian life in Jesuits is a good deal
                    more sophisticated

                     than it had been in the earlier volume. It was not so
                    sophisticated, however, as to transcend the limitations of the age. He had derived his views on
                    savagery from the eighteenth-century sources as well as contemporary writers such as Albert Gallatin
                    and Henry R. Schoolcraft and his own observations on the 
                        Oregon
                     Trail. With Morgan he was introduced to the most recent ethnological thinking, which
                    challenged his views on the question of the vanishing Indian. Although far more learned in his
                    methods than the natural historians of the Jeffersonian era, Morgan retained their belief in the
                    improvability of the Indians. Parkman disagreed generally, but he was sufficiently impressed by
                    Morgan's writings to offer some hope that the Iroquois, if not the other tribes, might be
                    capable of a happier future living like white men.9
            
            Indeed, even in Pontiac, Parkman expressed a relatively high opinion of the
                    Iroquois. He accepted without question the contemporary belief that the famous league had created a
                    forest empire by dint of conquest and superior political organization (I, 7-28). That idea was
                    almost certainly an exaggeration, but it is true that the Iroquois because of their Covenant Chain
                    with the British occupied a special status among the Indian people east of the Mississippi
                        River. Observers at the time sensed it, and Parkman could scarcely help but be
                    influenced by their views. Thus, while he perpetuated a legend concerning the extent of Iroquois
                    power, he was susceptible to evidence of Indian achievement.10
            
            Parkman's conviction that the Indian people were doomed to extinction raises the question of
                    race. What accounted for the Indians' dismal prospects in an age of progressive
                    expectation? The answer until well into the nineteenth century was either ethnic (their way of life
                    made it unlikely that they would move beyond their impaired condition) or more generally
                    anthropological (they were savages, the lowest rung on the evolutionary ladder, hence severely
                    limited in potential). Of course, neither of these explanations absolutely excluded the possibility
                    that the Indian would change his ways. In fact, many had no doubt at all that given time and the
                    right circumstances Indians would abandon savagery and move into the realm of civilization. But in
                    the second quarter of the nineteenth century the age of biology dawned, displacing the looser and
                    less scientific era of natural history. Biology became an important factor in defining human
                    capacity and in the gradual development

                     of a theory of race. Parkman's relationship to this
                    trend remains ambiguous. He certainly did employ the term "race" in his writing,
                    but most often the meaning is either not biological or so vague as to be indeterminate. He seemed
                    frequently to use "race" simply to identify a social group. Thus he conceived of
                    Indians as a whole as a race, but he also referred to Algonquians and Iroquois in an identical way
                    (I, 2, 4, 27, 29, 44). That he was influenced by the growing nineteenth-century fashion to assign
                    people to biological compartments and to attach invidious meanings to those categories can be seen
                    in his attitude toward race mixing. He entertained a very low opinion of mixed-race coureur de bois, calling them a "mongrel race of bush-rangers" (I, 63).
                    Parkman's touchiness about intermarriage between whites and Indians certainly links his use
                    of race to biology and with obvious implications. Whether he recognized those implications, however,
                    remains unclear.11
            
            Equally unclear was Parkman's habit of associating Indians with darkness. They were
                    "a race dark and subtle as their sunless mazes" (I, 157). Iroquois, he noted, had
                    "dark faces" (I, 18); Pontiac was darker than his brethren (I, 202). He described
                    a group of warriors at Ouiatenon as "a perilous multitude, dark, malignant,
                    inscrutable" (II, 291). Yet for all his fixation on darkness, it does seem to be the
                    Indians' savagery, their stage of life, that offended him most. As he wrote in reference to
                    Pontiac, "all savages, whatever may be their country, their color, or their lineage, are
                    prone to treachery and deceit" (II, 229).
            David Levin, in his discussion of the romantic historians, points to their practice of associating
                    darkness with the wilderness and demonic powers to illustrate certain character types. In European
                    thinking the Indians had long been linked with the darker forces in the world. Both the Jesuits and
                    the Puritans affected such images, and Parkman was a descendant of the Puritans and steeped in the
                    writings of the Jesuits. His views of Indian savagery and the hopeless future that awaited the
                    tribes plainly suggested the employment of dismal, even funereal metaphors. While romantic gloom
                    does not in itself exclude a tendency toward nineteenth-century racism, it does show that
                    Parkman's thinking about Indians and Europeans was more complex than critics like Jennings
                    have supposed.12
            
            What, then, are Parkman's achievements? First, in the two books in which the Indians counted
                    most, Pontiac and Jesuits, he gave them a prominent place in his
                    story. In Pontiac, especially, the native people initiate events. It is they who
                    fight to preserve their

                     way of life and to whom the British are forced to respond.
                    Considering his views on native culture and his notions on the outcome of the struggle for the New
                    World, this literary construction constituted a remarkable concession. Unfortunately, it cannot be
                    said to have really shaped his interpretation. His Indian still loses, as it was inevitable and
                    quite appropriate that he should. Parkman sees little in the way of tragedy in this denouement. He
                    can occasionally muster a modicum of sympathy for the Indians' desperate and hopeless
                    struggle. After all, he notes at one point that the Indians had been "goaded by wrongs and
                    indignities" (I, 185). They faced a settler population "rude, fierce and
                    contemptuous … [who] daily encroached upon … [their] hunting grounds
                    …, and then paid them for the injury with curses and threats" (I, 79). For
                    Parkman the Indian could rise above passivity, but he could never emerge triumphant even in the
                    short run.
            Also, Parkman turns out to be an early practitioner of the art of Indian biography. He returns
                    repeatedly to Pontiac as the nub of events even while he unfolds a complex plot in a panoramic
                    stretch of the continent. Indeed, the thesis of the book, that the Indian war originated in a
                    conspiracy, demands that Pontiac assume a critical role. But Parkman could not avoid the limitations
                    of the genre. Indians leave slim records of the kind that informed biography on the seaboard and in
                    Europe. He had no faith in the oral record. He was left largely with snippets of what Pontiac said
                    himself and with what Europeans said of him. The result would not sustain a full description of the 
                        Ottawa
                     chieftain's life. Yet Pontiac's presence in the story does
                    unquestionably lend a quotient of personal drama that would not be present in a more general
                    account. The addition of Bouquet, in many ways a more interesting character if only because he had
                    more to say for himself, sets off a contrast between the Swiss defender of civilization and the
                    Indian representative of the primitive past, a contrast dear to Parkman's heart.
            For this reason one suspects that Parkman preferred Bouquet, but he strained to give Pontiac his due.
                    Unfortunately what Park-man saw as his due had necessarily to be qualified by his misgivings
                    concerning the Indian world. Pontiac, according to Parkman, was a self-made man. Although he was the
                    son of a chief, heredity among the tribes was not sufficient to secure leadership.
                    "Courage, resolution, address, and eloquence" were the "sure path to
                    distinction." These qualities together with a "vehement ambition,"
                    "commanding energy …, force of mind, and … subtlety and
                    craft" established Pontiac's greatness. But here the praise took an inevitable
                    turn. He was, after all, a member of a "wily race." "Though capable of
                    acts of magnanimity, he was a thorough savage, with a wider range of intellect than those around
                    him, but sharing in all their passion and prejudices, their fierceness and treachery." Yet
                    these were the "faults of his race"; they could not "eclipse his  nobler qualities" (I, 183). One suspects that Pontiac
                    emerged from this literary ordeal with a personality more the offspring of Park-man's
                    imagination and his nineteenth-century anthropology than anything close to the reality.
            Parkman did in one sense manage to transcend the anthropological thinking of his age. The idea of the
                    savage, which he employed with great abandon, served to minimize the distinctions among native
                    groups, to include all Indians in one encompassing classification. But Parkman, an author of strong,
                    almost visceral preferences, drew sharp distinctions between the various human types that populated
                    his writings. Modern anthropology has, of course, displaced the idea of the savage and has much
                    diminished the significance even of the tribe as a taxonomic instrument, stressing instead the
                    significance of clans and smaller social groups. In the earlier period, however, tribal
                    identification of the Indians was inescapable. Although Parkman used tribal nomenclature, his
                    principal designation was larger. He referred to the Iroquois and the Algonquians as families (I,
                    289), an untechnical designation to be sure, but one demonstrating that he possessed a fairly
                    accurate sense of language differentiation.
            Unfortunately, Parkman then went on to attribute broad cultural characteristics to each group in a
                    way that seems more illustrative of his biases than any accurate accounting of native traits. He
                    much preferred the Iroquois even though he recognized the Algonquians had produced a number of major
                    native leaders. Pontiac and Tecumseh had their origins in that "family." He found
                    in the Iroquois "a robustness of mind unparalleled among tribes of a different
                    lineage" (I, 14). They were subtle, sagacious, eloquent, and given to "caustic
                    irony" (I, 15). He did criticize their craftsmanship but went on to offer high praise for
                    Iroquois farming and architecture (I, 16). They might have been burdened with a certain
                    "primitive rudeness" and a "boundless pride," but they enjoyed a
                    clear "mental superiority" over the other Indian peoples (I, 16, 21). Conversely,
                    he could find little to praise about the Algonquians. He concluded that "in moral stability
                    and intellectual vigor, they … [were] inferior" (I, 37). Regrettably, whatever
                    gain might have accrued from the abandonment of a single classification for the Indian, Parkman lost
                    by persisting in his use of the language of savagery.
            In defining the setting for his wilderness epic, Parkman anticipated another important modern
                    conception. His century-long struggle of 
                  France, England
               , and the Indians occurred in the lands south and
                    east of the Lakes, in what historians have recently come to call the "middle
                        ground."13 The notion of the savage assumed a two-sided conflict,
                    Europeans and Indians, with the tribesmen

                     fated to lose. But the actual story Parkman told involved three
                    participants, which similarly presupposed Indian defeat yet went on for the better part of a
                    century. As the final act in this struggle Pontiac may have lent itself to the
                    implicit resolution, but it built on the long contest in which the three sides staked out positions,
                    established bonds, and redefined their worlds in the setting of the middle ground. Until the 1790s,
                    after the time of Parkman's story, no party could either occupy the whole or within it
                    fulfill more than part of their intentions. Out of this struggle came the polyglot native societies
                    that so vexed the British and Parkman in Pontiac's uprising. Great numbers of these people
                    in the lands west of the 
                        Ohio
                     were immigrants from elsewhere, the refugees of past wars. Because of his fixation on
                    the distance between savagery and civilization, Parkman missed the opportunity to describe the
                    tentative convergence between Europeans and Indians. In the instances where he did recognize that
                    some of the participants had taken on the characteristics of the other, he found the results quite
                    unpleasant. The coureur de bois were mongrels, and the 
                        Pennsylvania
                     frontiersmen from Paxton who attacked peaceful Indians in 1763 had taken to behaving
                    like the savage warriors who had inflicted such punishment on them (II, 154-55). Finally, his
                    commitment to the vanishing Indian seriously undermined recognition of a gradual process of
                    acculturation among the native people. And yet, Park-man's account of Pontiac's
                    career and the Indian illustrated a major transition in the history of the middle ground, the point
                    at which the French dropped out of the tripartite struggle to be replaced by the Americans. He saw
                    clearly that the removal of the French had been crucial in fomenting the war and that the American
                    settlers constituted a force that would soon make the middle ground only a memory.
            Parkman's history is surely dated. His exaggeration of Pontiac's role, his
                    insistence on a unified Indian conspiracy, and his obsolete anthropology make his writing in many
                    ways a quaint vestige of the past. Despite Parkman's shortcomings his writing remains hard
                    to resist. Inflated as the prose may be, the Victorian periods do roll forward with compelling
                    force, the narrative has a spaciousness that modern history writing will seldom match, and the
                    depiction of personality a vividness and vitality that survives a century and a half after it was
                    written. Parkman must be read with a critical eye, but a reading of his work will always return both
                    pleasure and profit.

               Shade of the Raintree: The Life and Death of Ross Lockridge, Jr., Author of 
                            Raintree County

            This book is a recipe for disaster. Who wants to read a book about the writing of a novel (
                  
                            Raintree County
                        ) written by the son of the novelist with lots of first person interjection
                    weaving through? If that is not enough to turn away a reader, the suicide of the novelist runs
                    through the biography and through the life of the son and biographer. And yet miraculously, Larry
                    Lockridge's work deserves consideration as one of the very best biographies ever written of
                    a twentieth-century Hoosier.
            Not everyone likes 
                        
                            Raintree County
                        
                    , and Larry Lockridge may claim more for the novel than would most critics. But the book was a
                    national best seller in 1948, and it is still worthy of reading. For readers interested in Indiana,
                        
                        
                            Raintree County
                        
                     stands fully in the tradition (modernized to be sure) of Indiana literature. Set in 
                        Henry County
                     and based loosely on some of Lockridge's Hoosier forebears, the novel weaves
                    heroic visions of nineteenth-century Indiana, vital and alive, lyrical and beautiful, with a sense
                    of loss. There is an interesting parallel with a similar sense of time passing and of loss in John
                    Bartlow Martin's Indiana: An Interpretation (1947). And for readers in
                    the late 1940s and 1950s there were even connections to the other Hoosier best seller of 1948,
                    Alfred C. Kin-sey's Sexual Behavior in the Human Male. The sex and
                    eroticism of 
                        
                            Raintree County
                        
                    , including the naked female figure merging with the Hoosier landscape on the dust jacket, was
                    outrageous to some at the time (a dirty book) but now seems tame and may even help to make
                    Lockridge's Indiana as real and interesting as Booth Tarkington's.
            Those with no interest in 
                        
                            Raintree County
                        
                     will find delight and learning in Larry Lockridge's biography. His father was a
                    Hoosier, born in 
                        Bloomington
                     in 1914. Larry Lockridge provides a detailed account of his father's growing
                    up in Indiana, perhaps the best account in print of daily life in the 1920s and 1930s; of Boy Scout
                    camping, Epworth League meetings, courtship rituals, potluck dinners (to which in the midst of the
                    Depression everyone brought beans), student life on the 
                        Bloomington
                     campus. Ross Lockridge, Jr., left Indiana for a year in 
                        France
                     and 
                        Italy
                     while a student at Indiana University and later for school and work in 
                        Boston
                    ; but he always took Indiana with him and he always came back. The night he went to sit
                    in his new Kaiser to kill himself, folks assumed he was going to listen to the basketball regionals
                    on the car radio. His  tragic end does not negate the fact that
                    he was a serious writer who thought seriously about his home state and its history.
            An auxiliary benefit of this biography is the figure of Ross Lock-ridge, Sr. More Hoosier even than
                    his son, the senior Lockridge made a large mark on the state's history. His grandson
                    describes him as an "evangelical preacher and travelling salesman" for Indiana
                    history (p. 48). Ross Lockridge, Sr., wrote several books, including biographies for young adults of
                    George Rogers Clark and Abraham Lincoln, books that celebrate Indiana's past. He worked
                    hard to establish roadside markers and to protect historic sites. But above all Ross Lockridge, Sr.,
                    was a storyteller. He led historical tours and spoke all over the state at the sites he loved
                    (shrines to him)–
                        New Harmony
                    , the Mississinewa battlefield, Corydon–to hundreds and sometimes thousands
                    of avid listeners. Around a bonfire he reenacted great speeches and told the story of that
                    particular place in most vivid and heroic terms. Some more scholarly historians doubted the accuracy
                    of his stories and the legitimacy of his heroic interpretations of Indians and pioneers, but the
                    people of Indiana loved him. There are still some today who think that Ross Lockridge, Sr., was a
                    better writer and storyteller than his nationally famous son. It is surely the case that the more
                    famous son developed his sense of Indiana from helping his father write the books and organize the
                    historical tours.
            Larry Lockridge has written a book of immense pleasure and learning, built on a research foundation
                    of impressive depth, written with love and intelligence, and crafted in a way to make even the
                    reader not interested in

               The Hudnut Years in 
                            Indianapolis
                        , 1976-1991. By William H. Hudnut III with contributions by Mark S. Rosentraub
                    and others. (
                        Bloomington

            When politicians, and Bill Hudnut is still a politician, write a book, there is a tendency to expect
                    a self-serving tome highlighting the candidate's successes and minimizing failures.
                    Hudnut's book alters that standard format. The Hudnut Years is divided
                    into three sections. The first is written by Hudnut and chronicles philosophies, decisions, and
                    programs promoted during the mayor's four-term reign. In the second section eight academic
                    critics evaluate the mayor from a more objective position. Citizen critics comprise the third
                    section, and they mirror the academics in offering comments about the mayor from their perspective.
                    To his credit Hudnut  does not offer a rebuttal to either the
                    academic or citizen critics. In including such a wide array of commentaries, he deviates from the
                    norm and rises above the usual limits of politicians-cum-authors.
            It appears there is much debate concerning the 
                        Indianapolis
                     "miracle." With the city's high municipal bond rating and
                    strong economy, it is easy to see why many consider 
                        Indianapolis
                     an exception to the rust belt experience. Hudnut is proud of orchestrating the
                    "city that works." In his section he frequently reiterates his general philosophy,
                    "Not everyone will always agree, but the mayor must bring people together rather than drive
                    them apart. The mayor is a consensus builder" (p. 12). In celebrating his
                    administration's policies, Hudnut often gives short shrift to reasonable objections raised
                    by his opponents. For example, in summating a section on landfills he writes, "Although the
                    technology was controversial, we decided that incinerating trash and converting it into steam was
                    the wisest course" (p. 60). 
                        Indianapolis
                     has long been criticized as a city where decisions are made in committee and then the
                    finished product is presented to the citizenry as a fait accompli, an issue Fay H.
                    Williams addresses in her essay. For all of Hudnut's predilection for representation, the
                    image that much is done behind closed doors is not destroyed within The Hudnut
                    Years.
            
            Without question the strongest parts of the book are those written by the academic and citizen
                    contributors. It is in these sections that doubts are raised concerning the 
                        Indianapolis
                     "miracle." When subjected to critical analysis, 
                        Indianapolis
                     appears too reliant on a service- and sports-driven economy that does not materially
                    benefit most of its citizens. Each essay, with one exception, gives cogent analysis of 
                        Indianapolis
                    's city structure. While Hudnut deserves credit for including academic and
                    citizen critics in his book, the fact that he chose the critics must not be overlooked, and one
                    questions why he chose Carol D'Amico and Leslie Lenkowsky as academic critics of his
                    education policy. D'Amico and Lenkowsky, in polemic fashion, correctly absolve Hudnut from
                    the school system's failings and instead postulate that the school board's attempt
                    to "improve" schools through integration was flawed and ineffectual. Critics must
                    be careful to choose the proper measures with which to evaluate a system. All too often writers
                    allow their politics to shape their analysis. D'Amico and Lenkowsky's premise is
                    incorrect. 
                        Indianapolis
                     Public Schools (IPS) did not adopt desegregation as a means to improve schools.
                    Desegregation was implemented, with fierce resistance by IPS, to offer children an opportunity at
                    better schooling. The failings of IPS cannot and should not be blamed on desegregation. Further, to
                    imply, even subtly, that the integration of black and white children caused the lessening of quality
                    education in IPS is especially dangerous.
            
            There are two noteworthy technical problems that must be mentioned. The book attempts to be a
                    scholarly commentary on the mayor's tenure yet does not include an index, the absence of
                    which will be particularly frustrating to readers who want to juxtapose Hudnut's account
                    with those of his critics commenting on the same topic. The other failing is one of strategy. The
                    academic critics speak to only one or two aspects of the administration's program. In so
                    doing they obscure the larger picture. Many talk of the mayor's inability to affect
                    education, health, etc. The inability rises from the structure of UniGov, a political system the
                    mayor heralded yet did not critique. As the mayor with the longest tenure serving under the UniGov
                    model, it would have been helpful for Hudnut to offer commentary on the model's strengths
                    and weaknesses.
            Students of Indiana and, particularly, 
                        Indianapolis
                     history will find this book instructive. The Hudnut Years provides a
                    relatively concise chronology of the policies instituted during Hudnut's mayoral reign.
                    Those seeking an overview of 
                        Indianapolis
                     during the last two decades, however, will have to look elsewhere for a more
                    comprehensive analysis.

            Frederick Jackson Turner has sparked intellectual firestorms for more than a century. As Wilbur R.
                    Jacobs ably demonstrates in On Turner's Trail: 100 Years of Writing Western
                        History, one of the enigmas of American history is why this most amiable historian elicits
                    the most fervid emotions. He has inspired the devotion of such luminaries as Carl Becker, Merle
                    Curti, Marcus Lee Hansen, Herbert Eugene Bolton, Ray Allen Billington, and Martin Ridge while
                    kindling the wrath of such heavyweights as Charles A. Beard, Benjamin Wright, Isaiah Bowman, F. Lee
                    Benson, and Richard Hofstadter. From Herbert Baxter Adams and other Teutonic germ theorists in the
                    1890s to Patricia Nelson Limerick and other "new western" historians in the 1990s,
                    Turner's vision of the frontier and region has vexed five generations of Americans, making
                    him the most celebrated and reviled historian since Karl Marx.
            
               On Turner's Trail is a valuable chronicle of how this genial mid-westerner
                    launched an evocative tandem of ideas in the 1890s and of the tempests that have raged around them
                    ever since. A veteran of Turnerian controversies since the 1940s, Jacobs brings a shrewd  insider's knowledge to the narrative, effectively placing his
                    personal odyssey within a larger debate that reverberates throughout the historical profession.
                    Invoking Allen Nevins's belief that "one deserves to be treated with favor in the
                    first biography, but after that anything goes," Jacobs offers a critical assessment that
                    cuts far deeper than Billington's reverent biography (p. xiv).
            The book follows five steps in which Turner and his ruling theory are ruthlessly dissected and
                    eventually rehabilitated. The first section traces how Turner's midwestern background and
                    his education under William Francis Allen at 
                        Wisconsin
                     and Herbert Baxter Adams at Johns Hopkins shaped the frontier-sectional theory during
                    the 1880s and 1890s. The next two sections examine Turner's lifelong struggle to realize
                    the immense potential of this "ruling theory." Carefully analyzing one of the most
                    celebrated cases of writer's block and arrested development in American intellectual
                    history, Jacobs asserts that while Turner successfully applied the frontier-section theory to
                    colonial and agricultural history he failed to connect it to the twentieth century. Although Turner
                    anguished over contemporary issues, filling box after box with prescient notes and aborted essays
                    about urbanization, immigration, international relations, environmental destruction, and global
                    population problems, he was tragically unable to put these thoughts into print. The final two
                    sections follow the fate of this thwarted theory after Turner's death in 1932, from its
                    canonization by "realwestern" historians Frederick Merk and Ray Billington to its
                    rougher treatment by "new western" historians Richard White and William Cronon.
            Paradoxically, it is with the barbs of new western critics rather than with the accolades of
                    realwestern apostles that Jacobs rehabilitates Turner's thought. Adroitly praising White,
                    Cronon, and Limerick for exposing the racist, sexist, and imperialistic excesses of
                    Turner's thought, Jacobs also applauds them for inadvertently advancing Turner's
                    larger agenda and jolting his theory into the twentieth century. Their candid presentism,
                    geographical sensibility, and use of social science databases echo Turner's general
                    attitude toward history. Yet it is in their role as self-proclaimed regionalists that new western
                    historians contribute most vigorously to his larger theory. By depicting the transition from
                    frontier to region–tracing the rise of regionalism in the wake of the frontier and
                    exploring the interaction of cities and regional hinterlands– these erstwhile critics are
                    fulfilling the promise of Turner's frontier-sectional theory. "In seeking a
                    non-Turnerian identification," Jacobs shrewdly argues, "the authors have given us
                    a pro-Turneri-an picture of the West as a section that emerges in the wake of the frontier"
                    (p. 246).
            Engagingly written, wisely argued, filled with fresh anecdotes and effective details, On
                        Turner's Trail paints a complex portrait of a man and his ideas. Neither a saint
                    nor a villain, Jacobs's Turner  is a flawed and thwarted
                    genius whose early glimpse of the relationship between frontier and region remains "the
                    best model for American development that we have from any American historian" (p. 12).
                    Historians have been troubled by the ubiquitous, irrepressible Mr. Turner for more than a hundred
                    years, and Jacobs's important book clears fresh ground for another century of debate.

               Going Too Far Enough: American Culture at Century's End. By Henry
                    Southworth Allen. (
                        Washington
                    , D.C.: Smithsonian Institution Press, 1994. Pp. xii, 244. Index. $21.00.)
            "There are so few frontiers left of any kind, mechanical, artistic, political, whatever.
                    Americans like to know there's something happening out there. But it feels like nothing is
                    happening. If it weren't for the gunfire, you'd have a hard time telling the
                    difference between America and 
                        Canada
                    " (p. 12). So writes Henry Southworth Allen, critic for the 
                        Washington
                    
                    Post, whose articles on contemporary American culture for that newspaper are
                    collected in Going Too Far Enough. Allen has an uncanny knack for identifying the
                    ways that Americans cling to symbols of authentic experience– summer houses, 
                        New Hampshire
                    's white steeples, the Kennedys, the ethnic 
                        New York
                     of the old Daily News, outlaw hipsters like Dennis Hopper, and
                    fireworks displays on the Fourth of July–even as they know that authenticity is a sham.
                    His essays are simultaneously charming, haunting, and painfully on target in their evocation of
                    Americans' fumbling search for meaning in a nation that has ceased to aspire to anything.
            Allen writes with the keen eye of a good ethnographer or film critic, in short bursts of energetic
                    prose that recall the young Tom Wolfe without Wolfe's irritating condescension. And like
                    Wolfe, he is the rare journalist who has steeped himself in the classics of American Studies and
                    much of the recent work in cultural history. "We are sinners in the hands of an angry
                    God," he tells his readers, "and, being Americans, which is to say the offspring
                    of both Adam Smith and John Calvin, we are always on the lookout for a good deal on
                    redemption" (p. 1). But Americans are also a people who know that the days of redemption
                    and a good deal are behind them. The result, Allen suggests, is a country of nomadic nostalgics,
                    aware that their country's noble experiment has fizzled yet unwilling to give up the
                    familiar habit of looking for the main chance.
            There are some gems of satirical writing in this book. Allen offers a devastating critique of the
                    "tract mansions" that have  appeared all over
                    the country on what used to be farmland: "huge, exposed things, like beached
                    whales" that "look as if they were delivered rather than built… sitting
                    on no more land than it takes to hold the deck and the exhaust fans for the trilevel
                    air-conditioning" (p. 65). Modeled after the pleasure palaces on "Falcon
                    Crest" and "Dallas," and plopped down by streets named after Tory
                    politicians or towns in Provence, they look to Allen "likes houses on the hill without the
                    hill" (p. 67). He describes J. Edgar Hoover addressing journalists in 1968 in the cliched
                    argot of 1930s gangster movies: "He was a regular museum of forgotten Big Guy
                    moves," whose "face looked as if it might have just risen out of his collar like a
                    meat periscope" (p. 125). And Allen pounces on the foibles of the upper-middle-class
                    "Young Fogies" of the 1980s, "both sexes checking their watches when the
                    waiter asked if they wanted coffee" (p. 177).
            For all his gifts as a writer, however, Allen never quite delivers on his promise of a book that will
                    help readers understand "American culture at century's end." Cultural
                    critics once aimed higher, seeking to connect culture to politics, morality, and social structure
                    –if not in some grand theory, then at least in a form of cultural criticism that shaded
                    over into social criticism. Such an aspiration seems terribly quaint in this postmodern moment.
                    Allen is no postmodernist: he cares about history, believes that Americans hold certain ideals in
                    common, and thinks people's professed values have something to do with how they live their
                    lives. But he shares with his postmodernist peers a preference for edifying stories over more
                    systematic analysis. Amid all the chatter about the information age, there is a crying need for a
                    critic with Allen's intelligence who can explain what American culture says about American
                    institutions and the distribution of power at the end of the twentieth century. A criticism that
                    gives up on such an enterprise may be more a symptom than a diagnosis of a culture that stands for
                    nothing.

            Much excellent historical research that is presented at conferences does not reach a larger audience.
                    The publication of this volume  will help to disseminate new
                    research about the Trans-Appalachian West, and the Indiana Magazine of History
                    should be complimented for reviewing this volume.
            As in any edited volume, the papers vary in theme and strength. Several focus upon men who were
                    cultural mediators. Larry L. Nelson's study of Alexander McKee, while sparse about
                    McKee's life, allows a glimpse of a fascinating part-Shawnee frontier leader who helped
                    build an Indian alliance against American expansion and who became a prominent Canadian official and
                    landowner. This paper ably describes the rich ethnocultural mosaic found on the frontier of the Old
                    Northwest. Richard Day reviews in more detail the equally complex career of Daniel Sullivan. Born in
                    the Valley of 
                        Virginia
                    , Sullivan was captured and raised by the Delawares. He lived his adult life among
                    frontier Anglo-Americans and became a scout, militia officer, and substantial landowner. Sullivan,
                    killed by Indians, is remembered today through the name of 
                        Sullivan County
                    , Indiana. A third paper by Rob Mann and Rick Jones traces the life of French-Canadian
                    Zachariah Cicott. The authors employ archaeological data to show that Cicott apparently used French
                    building styles at the time he lived along the Wabash River in present-day 
                        Warren County
                    , Indiana. This practice may demonstrate that Cicott remembered the buildings of his
                    youth and retained to some degree a French cultural identity.
            Other papers in this volume deal with warfare. J. Martin West's solid study of George Rogers
                    Clark's 1780 expedition against the Shawnees notes the complexities and anti-civilian
                    aspects that pervaded frontier conflict on all sides. Kenneth C. Carsten provides a month-by-month
                    summary of the siege of Fort Jefferson, an outpost in far western 
                        Kentucky
                    . His paper is the only one in this volume that does not directly cite sources for
                    information. Dennis Au offers an intriguing paper about the military performance of 
                        Michigan
                    's relatively anonymous French-Canadian militiamen during the War of 1812. He
                    reminds readers that most of 
                        Michigan
                    's early settlers were French and that, while they bore complex loyalties, many
                    ably served in the 
                        United States
                     forces during that war.
            J. T. Scott briefly describes the impact of the great revival that began in 
                        Kentucky
                     in 1800, noting that evangelism had a more rapid impact upon eastern states than
                    trans-Appalachian democracy. Robert G. Gunderson's solid paper assesses William Henry
                    Harrison's early years as governor of Indiana Territory. It covers some of the political
                    maneuvers that brought Harrison a second term in office, and by describing Harrison's
                    family and social life, Gunder-son reminds readers that historical subjects should be studied within
                    the full contexts of their daily activities and not exclusively as political or military figures.
            In summary, these papers shed light upon several of the men who helped shape the trans-Appalachian
                    frontier. They illustrate  the ethnic complexities of this land
                    and show how individuals and peoples bridged cultural worlds. They portray the wide range of
                    political, military, family, and business activities that constituted daily life and demonstrate
                    that scholars can learn about the past through both documents and archaeological evidence.

               Eastland: Legacy of the Titanic. By George W. Hilton. (
                        Stanford
                    : 
                        Stanford
                     University Press, 1995. Pp. xvii, 364. Illustrations, tables, appendices, figures,
                    notes, index. $45.00.)
            On the drizzly morning of July 24, 1915, 2,501 persons swarmed aboard the excursion steamship Eastland tied up at a wharf in the Chicago River. Suddenly
                    the ship capsized. Eight hundred forty-four passengers drowned.
            In analyzing the Great Lakes' most costly marine disaster, and 
                        Chicago
                    's greatest of any kind, George W. Hilton meticulously traces the history of
                    the Eastland from its construction in 1903 through the litigation that followed
                    the catastrophe. He claims to be the first qualified researcher to investigate the disaster
                    seriously and adds that he is mystified by this scholarly neglect (p. ix). As a result of his
                    research, Hilton demolishes many myths: that the ship capsized because too many passengers rushed to
                    the same side simultaneously, that it had foundered on underwater obstructions and overturned as a
                    tugboat pulled it from the dock, and that water had rushed into open portholes.
            The book's subtitle, Legacy of the Titanic, concisely sums up
                    Hilton's conclusions, and the author makes a strong case that the disaster resulted from
                    the rigid requirements of Robert M. La Follette's Seamen's Act, which was passed
                    during the illogical and emotional "boats for all" movement following the sinking
                    of the Titanic in 1912. Hilton's research shows that the Eastland was top heavy from the time of its construction and that it almost capsized near
                    South Haven, 
                        Michigan
                    , in 1904. Later it listed dangerously in 
                  Cleveland, Ohio
               , and at 
                        Chicago
                    . The Seamen's Act compounded the problem by forcing the addition of lifeboats
                    and life rafts. This requirement, Hilton contends, reduced the ship's metacentric
                    height–a measure of transverse stability–to a negative figure when the boat
                    was loaded. The method of filling ballast tanks also is questioned.
            The disaster should have been no surprise. A catastrophe of this type had been predicted as the fate
                    of some undesignated vessel during congressional hearings on the La Follette bill. The 
                        Chicago
                    
                    
                    Tribune later wrote that "what was expected and predicted
                    happened."
            Criminal action against the owners, operators, and ranking crew members predictably followed the Eastland's sinking. Federal charges were assigned to Judge
                        Kenesaw Mountain Landis, a 
                        Logansport
                     native and former 
                        Marion

            Hilton's investigation is done in great depth and makes a fundamental contribution to marine
                    history, but his book is not for light bedtime reading. Although the work is necessarily complicated
                    and involved, one does question whether or not the heavy use of nautical terms could have been
                    simplified. A list that identifies fifty-five major actors in the cast is helpful, but a glossary of
                    nautical terms would have been similarly valuable.

            The opening years of the twentieth century witnessed both the dramatic expansion of the American
                    labor movement following the devastating depression of the mid-1890s and the rise of a concerted
                    employer counteroffensive against unionization. Ideological opposition to union work rules, wage
                    rates, and sympathetic strikes and advocacy of employers' unfettered right to manage was
                    cultivated by, and anchored in, a number of organizations, including the National Association of
                    Manufacturers, the American Anti-Boycott Association, and the National Erectors'
                    Association (NEA). Walter Drew, slighted or ignored in industrial relations historiography, was a
                    leading open shop zealot and, Sidney Fine suggests, the movement's most important figure.
                    He is the hero of Fine's laudatory biographical account and quasi-institutional history of
                    the NEA.
            Walter Drew dedicated his life to combating unions and spreading the open shop gospel. The 
                        Michigan
                    -born lawyer had formed his negative opinions of organized labor by the early twentieth
                    century, and apparently nothing over the next half century prompted any serious reevaluation of his
                    position. Indeed, Drew, the "true believer" (p. 206), emerges in these pages as an
                    intellectually dull figure; from the start of his career to his retirement, he played a one-note  song. His arguments against unions were standard employer
                    rhetoric, devoid of nuance or an understanding of his working-class opponents. His interest in
                    "history, philosophy, and science," as well as his "firm" belief
                    in astrology (p. 36), receives but passing mention and, apparently, did little to make Drew a more
                    interesting intellectual figure.
            For decades Drew pounded the proverbial pavement on behalf of employers' rights, fighting
                    not only unions that dared to question employers' power and practices but also employers
                    who might backslide and cut their own deals with unions. Seeking to block the spread of unionism to
                    the steel industry, Drew's particular target was the 
                        Indianapolis
                    -based International Association of Bridge, Structural and Ornamental Iron Workers
                    (IABSIW), a building trades union with a reputation for violence and corruption. For Drew and Fine
                    the IABSIW was composed of thugs, dynamiters, and intimidators; for both, apparently, any tactics
                    against it were warranted or at least understandable. In his seemingly never-ending struggle against
                    organized labor, Drew himself hired shady private detectives and sanctioned breaking and entering,
                    primitive wiretapping, theft of allegedly incriminating documents, and even kidnapping. Fine credits
                    Drew with prompting the federal government to indict and try the IABSIW's top leadership on
                    charges of dynamiting or hiring dynamiters in 1912. During the widely publicized case in 
                        Indianapolis
                    –which writer John Fitch described as the "largest criminal
                    conspiracy trial" (p. 124) in the nation's history–the NEA's
                    director worked closely with government attorneys, even providing funds to the prosecution.
            The strength of Fine's work lies in its careful reconstruction of the open shop
                    movement's day-to-day operation. Despite the depth of employers' anti-union
                    beliefs, maintaining a movement devoted to combating labor–and to overcoming
                    employers' tendencies toward fragmentation and division–required continual hard
                    work on the part of ideologues such as Drew. Yet Fine's contention that Drew and other open
                    shop advocates "generally directed their fire not at trade unionism as such but rather at
                    trade unionism practices" (p. 203) is not convincing since they attacked virtually
                    everything unions stood for and virtually every tactic unions employed. The author's
                    enthusiastic treatment of his subject includes few analyses of the shortcomings of Drew's
                    philosophy and practices or new insights into the world of the building trades workers whom Drew
                    consistently battled. The book's level of detail–accounts of strikes, meetings,
                    and campaigns against unions are numerous and long–and the one-dimensional character of
                    its subject will limit the book's appeal to specialists in industrial relations and labor
                    history.

               Making the Corn Belt: A Geographical History of Middle-Western Agriculture. By
                    John C. Hudson. (
                        Bloomington
                    : Indiana University Press, 1994. Pp. ix, 254. Maps, illustrations, tables, notes,
                    index. $35.00.)
            John C. Hudson's Making the Corn Belt provides a broad and comprehensive
                    portrait of middle-western agriculture that begins with a summary of the region's formation
                    in the Pleistocene Age, a review of earliest explorations and settlements, and a brief history of
                    corn itself. Hudson effectively dismantles the Corn Belt myth that describes the region as evolving
                    "a landscape checkerboard of mixed grain-livestock family farms, peopled by a blend of
                    folks from the North and the South who contributed their diverse ways to a new and stable
                    synthesis" (p. 62). The Corn Belt originated, he argues, in five islands of fertile land
                    west of the Appalachians in the period before 1840–the Scioto
                    Valley, Miami Valley, 
                        Nashville
                    
                    BasinPennyroyal, Plateau, and the
                    Bluegrass. It was in these areas that farmers developed the efficient practice
                    of feeding corn to livestock, and it was from these five islands that people moved west to settle
                    the 
                  Wabash, Illinois, Mississippi
               , and lower 
                        Missouri
                     valleys. The Miami Valley, with market-oriented farmers and
                    merchants who "entered the business of milling grain and packing meat for
                    shipment," came to typify the Corn Belt (p. 103). Yankee influence was minimal, and even 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , except for the "offspring it sent to the Middle West via the five
                    islands," did not "directly shape the Corn Belt" (p. 103).
            
               Making the Corn Belt provides a coherent chronological narrative of the Corn
                    Belt's subsequent evolution. Emerging as an identifiable region in the period from 1840 to
                    1860, the Corn Belt at midcentury was closely tied to river-based commerce along the 
                        Mississippi
                     and Ohio Rivers and their tributaries. In an interesting chapter
                    on Corn Belt sectionalism, Hudson explains that the vast majority of the people opposed slavery not
                    as a matter of moral repugnance but because "labor required for corn/livestock agriculture
                    was not enough to employ many slaves" (p. 121). After 1860 the Corn Belt spread west and
                    north as railroads made possible both its expansion and specialization. More recently, irrigation on
                    the High Plains and changes in transportation have further altered the contours of the Corn Belt
                    (extending it to 
                        New Mexico
                     and 
                        Texas
                    ) and have transformed the cattle industry. Hudson explains, "the short-term
                    benefits of irrigating corn, feeding it to cattle in lots, and preparing meat for sale in the same
                    locality have been enough to move more than half of the beef industry of the 
                        United States
                     to the High Plains in the past twenty-five years" (p. 186). Concentrated in
                    urban centers such as 
                  Chicago, St. Paul
               , and Omaha from 1880 to 1960, the meatpacking
                    industry has become entirely rural-based.
            
            Hudson somewhat slights the impact of government policies on the evolution of Corn Belt agriculture.
                    More information on land distribution policies in the nineteenth century and the impact of subsidies
                    in the twentieth century would further enhance this thorough study. The author does, however, reveal
                    the ironies of Secretary of Agriculture Henry A. Wallace's role in advocating crop
                    reductions as part of the New Deal agricultural program while simultaneously promoting seed through
                    his own company, Pioneer Hi-Bred Corn Company, an action that actually added to the corn surplus.
            Hudson's book is a valuable synthesis of recent secondary literature on the agriculture of
                    the Middle West and his own primary research. It will serve as a standard reference on this vast
                    subject for years to come.

            Donna Gabaccia, a well-published historian of migration, now presents a full-scale synthesis of women
                    migrants' history from 1820 to 1990, from Irish and German to Laotian and Latina. From the Other Side supplies a major need and builds, as the author says, on the
                    bibliographies of immigrant women compiled by Francesco Cordasco (1985) and herself (1989).
            Gabaccia's strategy is topical rather than chronological. The book has three parts. In the
                    first, "Coming to the 
                        United States
                    ," Gabaccia devotes an opening chapter to a deft survey of Americans'
                    historic migration waves and the ways they connected with "the capitalist world
                    economy." She personalizes the discussion by summarizing the life experiences of three
                    women who migrated: a German in 1854, a Polish Jew in 1904, and a Mexican in 1973. This device,
                    which she follows throughout the book, enhances readability and adds much vividness. Though dealing
                    with abstract global forces, Gabaccia reminds the reader that these migrants were flesh-and-blood
                    women, each with her own individual story. The second chapter details the women's shift
                    from subsistence peasant economies to the industrializing 
                        United States
                     and the changes that resulted in their family relations, religions, occupations, and
                    "womanly behavior" (p. 25). The third chapter treats sex ratios, marriages (both
                    arranged and "free"), work (citing the histories of a Swede, a Croat, two
                    Italians, two Japanese, a Chinese, a Mexican,  two Poles, an
                    Irishwoman, and an Armenian), and the effects of federal law.
            The second part, "Foreign and Female: Continuities in Immigrant Life," devotes a
                    chapter to paid employment and unpaid work, past and present. The next chapter analyzes family life,
                    including chain migration and power within families. Another discusses voluntary organizations,
                    neighborhoods, church and secular groups, and labor unions. The third part of the volume shows
                    "how class and cultural change in the twentieth century has redefined both immigrant
                    women's adaptation to U.S. life and the identities of their female descendants"
                    (p. xiv). Career paths, mobility, and the "domestication of ethnicity" appear
                    here. The seven-page conclusion is studded with gems of insight comparing male and female ethnic
                    identity and the contemporary situation of migrants.
            The topical strategy–surveying an entire 170-year period and crossing a welter of ethnic
                    lines–inevitably leads to a sense of meeting all these people several times and to some
                    sacrifice of narrative drive and temporal context that a chronological organization would ensure.
                    The advantage of topical chapters, however, is to sharpen the definition of problems these migrant
                    women faced in common despite their diverse backgrounds and time contexts.
            A very valuable bibliographical essay discusses references relevant to each of the eight chapters and
                    then lists general studies on migrant women and about three dozen works on women of specific
                    nationalities. All of this, and of course the very topic of women migrants, should make the book
                    especially useful for classes in migration history. Serious students of international migration,
                    past and present, should not be without it.

            The last decade has been a delightful one for historians of American religion. Works like Jon 
                        Butler
                    's Awash in a Sea of Faith (1990) and Nathan O.
                    Hatch's The Democratization of American Christianity (1989) have provided
                    wonderfully readable and provocative reinterpretations of American religious life between the
                    Revolution and the Civil War. Paul K. Conkin's The Uneasy Center is a
                    welcome addition to this distinguished company. Conkin has provided the best general overview
                    available of the origins and development of what is now called mainline Protestantism in the 
                        United States
                    .
            
            Conkin casts his net widely, defining his subject as virtually all Protestants besides Lutherans and
                    a few small sects, but focusing on Methodists, Presbyterians, Baptists, Congregationalists, and
                    Episcopalians. He is also expansive in chronology, beginning his account with the development of
                    basic doctrines in the early church, the split between the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox
                    churches, and the reformations in 
                  England, Scotland
               , and Ulster as well as on the continent. He
                    concludes his introductory material with a deft and incisive sketch of John Wesley and early
                    Methodism.
            Conkin is an intellectual historian, and this is a work that takes ideas seriously. Conkin delights
                    in Jonathan Edwards but sees his lasting impact as problematic. Samuel Hopkins is for Conkin less
                    profound than Edwards but important in restating Calvinist theology. Nineteenth-century figures such
                    as Nathaniel Taylor, Charles Hodge, and Horace Bushnell also receive considerable attention. A
                    pattern is clear: Conkin sees the most incisive and imaginative theological work being done by
                    Presbyterians and Congregationalists.
            At the same time, Conkin does give attention to patterns of worship and the experience and outlook of
                    those who were not in the pulpit. This is a work to turn to for everything from the curriculum of a
                    Sunday school to what happened in a Methodist class meeting to the development of church music, as
                    well as for the difference between Reformed and Associate Presbyterians.
            Conkin does not try to make too many generalizations or find too many great unifying themes, and that
                    is all to the good. While focused on the development of the religious outlook that became known as
                    evangelicalism and the ways it changed over time, Conkin is always aware of differences, appropriate
                    in a work that finds fierce denominational competition. Not everyone will like everything
                    here–many will look askance at a book on antebellum Protestantism that gives more
                    attention to Charles Hodge than to Charles G. Finney. But on balance, Conkin's work is a
                        tour de force that is elegantly written, masterful in its command of both
                    primary and secondary materials, and careful and persuasive in its conclusions. This book deserves
                    the attention of anyone who enjoys reading good history.

            Richard Hughes Seager's work contributes enormously to the understanding of the
                    World's Parliament of Religions, to which few  scholars
                    have given sustained attention. Held in conjunction with the Columbian Exposition in 
                        Chicago
                    , this "wholly extraordinary assembly" generated wide public and
                    journalistic interest and, as Seager shows, "deserves a central place in American and
                    modern religious history" (p. xv).
            Although Seager identifies many issues that merit investigation, his focus is on the discourse
                    between western (primarily Christian) and Asian delegates as they explored commonalities and
                    differences in a quest for global religious unity. In this encounter the Asians exposed assumptions
                    about the superiority and normativity of Christianity held by virtually all of the Christian
                    delegates and thus drew attention to the contradiction between those assumptions and the
                    parliament's universalistic rhetoric. "The God of the organizers," he
                    writes, "turned out not to be quite the same as the Gods of the Asians" (p. xxix).
            Seager sets the parliament in the context of the exposition, whose layout, architecture, and
                    symbolism displayed a self-celebratory and hegemonic "Columbian Myth," composed of
                    classical, Christian, and patriotic motifs energized by a progressive American millennialism.
                    Contrasting the exposition's 
                        White City
                     (with its grandiose monuments to American and western achievements) and the Midway
                    Plaisance (with its ethnic villages and concessions), he argues that the exposition articulated
                    ethnocentric evolutionary notions with which the views of westerners at the parliament were
                    congruent.
            In treating the parliament itself and its aftermath, Seager explores the limits to inclusiveness and
                    universalism expressed by western delegates and observers. Some openly contended that Christianity
                    alone was true. Others, granting that all religions had some validity, sought common denominators in
                    a universal theism and commitment to human betterment. Even the most liberal, however, at least
                    implied that Christianity completed and fulfilled other religions.
            The Asians questioned western assumptions on numerous issues, from the appropriateness of missionary
                    activities to the nature of deity. The most effective Asians–the Buddhists Anagari-ka
                    Dharmap la of Ceylon and Shaku S en of 
                        Japan
                     and the Hindus Protap Chunder Majumbar and Vivekananda–were articulate,
                    irenic yet critical, and well versed in western culture. Hardly primitive
                    "heathens," they engaged the West on western terms, using the modern science of
                    religion to introduce their religions on a basis of parity to western religions.
            Seager explores two developments in the parliament's aftermath of particular importance for
                    the twentieth century. One was the emergence of a pluralist perspective from which attempts at
                    global religious unity were both unrealistic and unnecessary. The second was the beginning of a
                    reverse missionary movement, as  some Asians, buoyed by their
                    experiences in 
                        Chicago
                    , left the parliament to organize American missions and/or returned home to promote
                    religious revitalization and nationalism.
            Though sharply focused, Seager's work is never narrow or pedantic. He suggests intriguing
                    varieties of meaning and significance, and he takes a long view of the parliament as a marker for
                    subsequent religious developments and for a more radically pluralistic society. For a rich encounter
                    with many of the sources he has used, one should read his anthology, The Dawn of
                        Religious Pluralism: Voices from the World's Parliament of Religions, 1893 (1993).

               An Unspeakable Sadness: The Dispossession of the 
                            Nebraska
                         Indians. By David J. Wishart. (Lincoln: University of 
                        Nebraska
                     Press, 1994. Pp. xv, 309. Maps, tables, illustrations, graphs, notes, selected
                    bibliography, index. $50.00.)
            David J. Wishart, a geographer, concentrates on four groups– Pawnee, Omaha, Ponca, and Otoe-
                        Missouri
                    –who in 1800 resided in eastern 
                        Nebraska
                    . He covers these tribes from that date to the final two decades of the nineteenth
                    century. Wishart's first chapter provides a good summary of tribal backgrounds and shows
                    that the four groups employed subsistence patterns derived from both the woodland and plains
                    Indians. The 
                        Nebraska
                     Indians devoted part of their annual cycle to village life and agriculture, but they
                    also ventured onto the plains during summers and winters to hunt buffalo. Both approaches were
                    essential to their existence.
            After the initial chapter Wishart examines the overwhelming changes that 
                        Nebraska
                     Indians experienced after 1800. His discussion focuses on the impact of the fur trade,
                    Christian missionaries, and the federal government. Although fur trading and missionizing were
                    important, Wishart's treatment clearly indicates that federal Indian policies brought much
                    more significant and lasting changes. All four groups faced serious problems, especially after 1854
                    when Congress opened 
                        Nebraska
                     to settlement. Various land cessions reduced the Indians' land base, frictions
                    with whites intensified, and access to buffalo hunting became more difficult because of a lack of
                    weapons and the aggressive behavior of the Dakota and other plains Indians. Wishart's
                    treatment reveals several additional patterns: federal officials consistently demanded that 
                        Nebraska
                     Indians settle on individual land holdings and assume a white lifestyle, the tribes
                    agreed to additional land cessions and at least partial relocations to Indian Territory to relieve
                    their destitution,  and federal officials failed to protect the 
                        Nebraska
                     Indians' villages from attacks by plains tribes who had access to the most
                    up-to-date weapons. Wishart's book, indeed, amounts to a harsh but objective indictment of
                    federal policies and their implementation, an indictment that is borne out in his final chapter,
                    which deals largely with the 
                        Nebraska
                     Indians' claims cases after World War II.
            Although this book is very much a history, Wishart's geographic background is also apparent.
                    His maps, both those drawn for the book and ones selected from nineteenth-century sources, and his
                    numerous statistical charts and graphs complement and enrich his text. Similarly, his discussion of
                    demography provides important insights into various factors, especially repeated epidemics, that
                    produced population declines.
            Those who prefer their history sugarcoated should not read this book. The story of the 
                        Nebraska
                     Indians is truly one of "unspeakable sadness." If there is anything
                    inspiring in Wishart's fine treatment, it is the Indians' remarkable cultural
                    persistence and their heroism in a prolonged struggle for survival.

            In American Indian affairs today, no issue looms larger than that of tribal sovereignty. Crow Dog's Case is a study of nineteenth-century legal cases that brought to the
                    deliberation of U.S. courts the issue of tribal sovereignty that stems directly from the treaty
                    relationship between the federal government and Indian tribes. By examining the historical
                    development of the U.S. legal doctrine of tribal sovereignty and by exploring indigenous legal
                    concepts of the tribes themselves, this study provides a valuable foundation for understanding the
                    complexities of the legal relationship between the federal government and Indian tribes.
            The books takes its title from the celebrated case of Crow Dog, a Brule Sioux, who murdered the
                    tribal chief, Spotted Tail, in 1881. Following tribal law, the murderer's family
                    compensated the family of the deceased with valuables. Under U.S. law, however, Crow Dog was jailed
                    and tried by the Dakota territorial court, found guilty, and condemned to hang. The court's
                    decision was overturned by the  Supreme Court, which argued in
                    1883–recognizing both tribal law and the sovereignty sanctioning its
                    application–that the laws of the 
                        United States
                     did not apply to crimes committed by Indians against Indians in Indian country. Crow
                    Dog was set free, but the next year Congress passed the Major Crimes Act, extending federal criminal
                    jurisdiction over specific types of crime on reservations.
            On the basis of his historical survey the author identifies four distinct legal models that
                    structured nineteenth-century Indian-white relations. In the first, states asserted their own
                    sovereignty and, in defiance of the federal government, claimed complete jurisdiction over Indians
                    living within their boundaries. The case of Corn Tassel (1830), a Cherokee Indian tried and
                    sentenced in 
                        Georgia
                     for a crime committed on Indian land, exemplifies this model. After he appealed to the
                    Supreme Court, Corn Tassel was summarily hanged by the state.
            The Corn Tassel case set the stage for the second model of Indian-white relations, articulated in the
                    classic 1832 case of 
                  
                            Worcester
                         v. 
                            Georgia
                        
                in which Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall upheld the sovereignty of
                    Indian tribes as "domestic dependent nations." The book examines cases from the
                    history of the five tribes (Cherokees, Creeks, Choctaws, Chickasaws, and Seminoles) that were
                    removed in the 1830s from the South to Indian Territory, later 
                        Oklahoma
                    , and that established national governments and legal systems which were in effect
                    throughout the nineteenth century.
            The third model was the rejection of Indian sovereignty by Congress and the imposition by the Bureau
                    of Indian Affairs of a program of forced assimilation on the reservations. This model, a direct
                    outgrowth of the Crow Dog case, is exemplified by 
                  
                            United States
                         v. Kagama (1886). The decision in this Supreme Court case articulated the
                    first statement of the plenary power doctrine, which asserts essentially unlimited federal power
                    over Indian tribes, thereby relegating them to the status of wards of the government. The book
                    chronicles successive restrictions on tribal sovereignty by the vastly increased number of Indian
                    legal cases during the last two decades of the nineteenth century. As the author notes, this model
                    "represents the deliberate use of U.S. law to destroy the Indian tribes" (p. 23).
            The fourth model is specific to Alaska, where an 1872 court decision gave individual natives the same
                    rights as non-Indians but did not recognize native legal or political institutions. In short, the
                    sovereignty of Alaskan native tribes was not recognized, and the situation there in the 1870s
                    approximated what the state of 
                        Georgia
                     had attempted to impose in the 1820s. The Tlingit serve as the case study for this
                    model.
            The penultimate chapter discusses "U.S. Law and the Indian Wars" and is a fine
                    illustration of the point made in the concluding  chapter that
                    although historians have long focused on the processes of forced assimilation that transformed
                    Indian tribes during the late nineteenth century, they have neglected the role of the law in shaping
                    that transformation. Sidney L. Harring's work shows what a rich field of study this can be.

                         Freedom Struggle. By Charles M. Payne. (Berkeley: University of

            If any questions linger about whether the 
                        Mississippi
                     freedom movement was an organic resistance movement, then Charles M. Payne's
                        I've Got the Light of Freedom should erase all doubt. The movement
                    was created and sustained by an organizing tradition that stretched back to the early 1940s. It
                    featured an "activism of an earlier, socially invisible generation," including war
                    veterans, ministers, civic-minded businessmen, and ordinary laborers. Greenwood is the focus of
                    Payne's story, and the peak years of movement activity there were 1962-1964, during which
                    time local activists waged a very valiant struggle for political access, economic justice, and
                    social equality.
            Payne begins with a detailed and graphic "reminder" of the racial terror that was
                    so endemic to the Magnolia state prior to World War II. After the war significant changes resulted
                    in socioeconomic conditions more favorable to a budding protest movement. The character and
                    instances of racial terror waned by the late 1940s and early 1950s. A virtual collapse of the
                    cotton-based economy weakened any inclination toward control of black labor through the usual forms
                    of violence such as lynching. In addition, black Mississippians became more militant because of the
                    widening influence of returning veterans.
            African Americans responded by taking advantage of these changes. In the 1940s the pace of political
                    mobilization stepped up appreciably. Organizations formed; black newspapers printed strong
                    endorsements of local registration drives; membership for the National Association for the
                    Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) increased significantly, as did the numbers of black voter
                    registrants.
            Many of those associated with the postwar 
                        Mississippi
                     activism were veterans who would lay the foundation for the movement that  took shape in the early 1960s. They included such movement notables as
                    Amzie Moore, Medgar Evers, and Aaron Henry. Through their work with the NAACP in 
                        Mississippi
                    , Payne argues, an organizing tradition was firmly planted in the state.
            If Moore, Evers, and Henry were the three who established the organizing tradition, then 
                        South Carolina
                     activist Septima Clark, veteran organizer Ella Baker, and white liberal Myles Horton
                    developed the movement's organizing philosophy. That philosophy included a
                    "developmental style of politics" which identified and nurtured local leaders and
                    urged them to address pressing local issues, including poverty, illiteracy, school segregation, and
                    political disfranchisement. This organizing philosophy held that the most effective struggle emerged
                    from the bottom up, with the local, rural people in full participation and control.
            Thus, between 1962 and 1964 Greenwood became one of the most successfully organized towns in the 
                        Mississippi
                     freedom struggle, both because of its organizing tradition and because its leaders
                    embraced the movement's organizing philosophy. Local citizens seized the moment and threw
                    their energies into the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), the 
                        Mississippi
                     Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP), the Council of Federated Organizations (COFO) and the
                    NAACP. Payne describes very clearly the challenges and difficulties of mobilizing a town, from
                    door-to-door canvassing to electrifying mass meetings, and he concludes that Greenwood was one of
                    the most successful cases of local leadership development.
            The entire experience proved to be transformative for both individuals and organizations. Ultimately,
                    however, by 1965, the movement lost momentum. Payne attributes the resulting demoralization to the
                    introduction of new participants with more selfish motives, a different moral climate, and the loss
                    of a sense of community. Another sign of transformation was the emergence of the Loyal Democrats, a
                    party organization that was much more moderate than the grass-roots MFDP that preceded it. In
                    essence, the movement became a victim of its own success, Payne concludes.
            This study is a well-researched account of some extremely important rural civil rights history. With
                    its penetrating focus on local events and personalities, I've Got the Light of
                        Freedom joins other significant studies on post-World War II 
                        Mississippi
                    . The retelling of well-known episodes of the movement makes the book tedious at times,
                    but Payne more than compensates with some lively, compelling anecdotes. This book is sure to have a
                    very long shelf life.

               Mammy and Uncle Mose: Black Collectibles and American Stereotyping. By Kenneth
                    W. Goings. (

                    : Indiana University Press, 1994. Pp. xxiv, 123. Illustrations, table, notes,
                    bibliography, index. Clothbound, $35.00; paperbound, $22.50.)
            Racial stereotyping has long been an American custom used consciously and unconsciously to reenforce
                    the concept of racial inferiority of African Americans. Indeed, the Sambo racial stereotype has
                    become ubiquitous on the American consumer landscape. Postcards, newspaper advertisements, kitchen
                    utensils, yard ornaments, pottery, glassware, and magazine covers have all been used as billboards
                    upon which to affix the image of the big-lipped, bug-eyed, nappy-haired, dark-skinned, tattered, and
                    ungrammatical Sambo stereotypes.
            Kenneth W. Goings's Mammy and Uncle Mose is one of the latest studies of
                    this American cultural phenomenon. Joseph Boskin's Sambo: The Rise and Demise
                        of an American Jester (1986) analyzed primarily the folk trickster dimensions of Sambo, and
                    Middle-ton A. Harris, Morris Levitt, Roger Furman, and Ernest Smith's The
                        Black Book (1974) was an eclectic "scrapbook" of black memorabilia.
                    Goings's primary reason for writing his book was "not merely to list and describe
                    items, but to delineate the processes which brought about their production and use, and their
                    eventual demise" (p. viii). Goings, who uses the terms "black
                    collectibles" and "black memorabilia" interchangeably, defines them as
                    being those consumer "items made in or with the image of an African-American …
                    in the 
                        United States
                    , Europe, and Asia from the 1880s to the late 1950s" (p. xiii).
            Goings, a professor of American history at 
                        Florida
                     Atlantic University, has arranged his study in a chronological manner. Chapter 1
                    describes black collectibles in terms of race, society, politics, gender, and economics. Chapter 2
                    takes a critical look at the black collectibles made from the 1880s through the 1930s, "the
                    worst period (excluding the slavery era) in our nation's history for race
                    relations" (p. xvii). Chapter 3 examines those black collectibles made from the 1930s to
                    the very early 1960s, the historical period when the "exaggerated nature of many of the
                    earlier collectibles was now being replaced by more restrained stereotypes …"
                    (p. xvii). Chapter 4, the final chapter of the book, explores the reasons for the "death
                    and resurrection" of black collectibles from the Civil Rights era to today.
            Among the book's many interesting features are its illustrations. Its pages are filled with
                    Sambo planters, children's toys, coin banks, sheet music illustrations, and table-top
                    figurines culled from the author's private collection. Color images of black children and
                    adults on Gold Dust cleanser and Cream of Wheat cereal advertisements; color postcards of seven
                    rail-perched pickaninnies and six  grinning watermelon-eating
                    boys, and coon sheet music covers all contribute to the study. These photographs are balanced by a
                    smaller collection of black-and-white images of Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcolm
                    X, and Angela Davis on buttons, postcards, magazine covers, and commemorative coins.
            In sum, Mammy and Uncle Mose: Black Collectibles and American Stereotyping is an
                    important addition to the study of Sambo racial stereotypes.

                    published from 1991 through 1995 is intended as a bibliographic contribution to Indiana's
                    history. The list will normally appear in each March issue of the Indiana Magazine of

                    hope that readers will help us by sending items for possible inclusion. We are especially interested
                    in listing publications that make some contribution to understanding Indiana's past but
                    that are not usually reviewed in the IMH. Generally, we will not list newspaper articles or accounts
                    of local historical society activities, but printed pamphlets as well as journal articles may be
                    listed. All such items for the March, 1997, issue must be received by November 1, 1996. Many people
                    have contributed to the present list, but major responsibility has rested with Leigh Darbee of the
