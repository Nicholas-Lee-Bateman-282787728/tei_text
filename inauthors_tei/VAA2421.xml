                <head>EXPLANATION</head>
                <p>AT last my verses are to be published! I would not trust them to a commercial
                    publisher. Come to think of it, no commercial publisher has asked for them. Why?
                    Because I am not suspected of being a poet, or a versifier or even a
                    rhymester.</p>
                <p>But a newspaper writer feeding a hungry column, an eight-hour librettist
                    answering the call for &quot;extra numbers&quot; and a college alumnus
                    helping out on the annual, finds, in checking up the rush-and-tumble work of
                    many years, that he has accumulated in his private archives quite a mess of
                    something or other that cannot be filed under the head of
                    &quot;prose.&quot;</p>
                <p>Many of the items of merchandise filling these pages were prepared for various
                    musical plays. Some were tried out and <pb id="VAA2421-006" n="[]"/> failed to
                    satisfy the yearnings of the tired business man who happened to be in the
                    theater that evening. Others were handed back to me as being too subtle or too
                    frivolous or too something. Anyway they were handed back. Some of them were sung
                    in public, but these will seem new, even to those who endeavored to hear
                    them.</p>
                <p>Most of them will be tagged and some dated not that I would take advantage of the
                    statute of limitations, but merely to let the reader know that I formed the
                    habit early in life and could not overcome it immediately.</p>

                        <l n="52">That doubtless I had gushed in days of yore.</l>
                        <l n="53">I merely tipped my hat, I feared to introduce my wife,</l>
                        <l n="54">For I knew that some remark might lightly fall,</l>
                        <l n="55">Revealing to my better half a chapter of my life,</l>

                        <l n="2">The name of that highly deluded old fluff</l>
                        <l n="3">Who chartered a schooner and sailed o&apos;er the sea </l>
                        <l n="4">Long after Columbus, but long before me </l>
                        <l n="5">Through primeval forests he went on a quest</l>
                        <l n="6">Of the fountain of youth lying far to the west;</l>
                        <l n="7">For it seems that a sailor, who knew how to string,</l>
                        <l n="8">Had told this old man of a magical spring,</l>
                        <l n="9">Which would change any withered emeritus prof</l>
                        <l n="10">To a lusty and vigorous freshman or soph.</l>

                        <l n="11">So he came and he searched oh, you <hi rend="i">must</hi> know his
                            name,</l>
                        <l n="12">The text-books have boomed him and given him fame;</l>
                        <l n="13">Was it Balboa? No. Or De Soto? Great Scott!</l>
                        <l n="14">All the Ridpath I studied I quickly forgot.</l>
                        <l n="15">No matter he firmly believed in the myth </l>
                        <l n="16">It was <hi rend="i">not</hi> Hendrik Hudson or Captain John Smith </l>
                        <l n="17">Hold on! <hi rend="i">Ponce de Leon!</hi> I knew it would come </l>
                        <l n="18">He thought that this fountain of youth would help some;</l>
                        <l n="19">So he landed and built on the Jacksonville line</l>
                        <l n="20">A high-priced hotel that is still doing fine.</l>
                        <l n="21">Then he said to his followers, &quot;Boys, on your way;</l>
                        <l n="22">I must run down that fountain without much delay,</l>
                        <l n="23">For I&apos;m just about in I&apos;m a thing of the
                            past,</l>
                        <l n="24">And unless I&apos;m patched up, I&apos;m afraid I
                            can&apos;t last.&quot;</l>
                        <l n="25">Now the histories tell that his search was in vain</l>
                        <l n="26">And instead of returning in triumph to Spain,</l>
                        <l n="27">A cocky young blade of about twenty-three;</l>
                        <l n="28">He got lost in the mountains of east Tennessee;</l>
                        <l n="29">Got stung by mosquitoes which gave him the shakes </l>
                        <l n="30">Got shot at by Injuns and hissed at by snakes;</l>
                        <l n="31">Got tired and disgusted; got most everything</l>
                        <l n="32">Except the address of that wonderful spring.</l>

                        <l n="33">So he took the back trail through the jungle and brake,</l>
                        <l n="34">Convinced that the mariner&apos;s yarn was a fake;</l>
                        <l n="35">And he died in the orthodox manner, we&apos;re told.</l>

                        <l n="10">He roamed through the hemisphere still known as new,</l>
                        <l n="11">And sought, with Diogenes&apos; patience, the spring</l>
                        <l n="12">Where Methusaleh might, as a giddy young thing</l>

                        <l n="16">He would read in a folder the unstinted praise</l>

                        <l n="17">Of this or that spring with a five-dollar rate,</l>

                        <l n="23">But at Hot Springs, Arkansas, and even French Lick</l>
                        <l n="24">They were old and shot-up and disabled and sick;</l>

                        <l n="32">Way down in Virginia the weather was hot </l>
                        <l n="33">The time was midsummer; the flags were unfurled,</l>
                        <l n="34">And tourists were flocking from half of the world.</l>
                        <l n="35">There were strange foreign people of most every race</l>
                        <l n="36">And Ponce thought he&apos;d struck a new watering-place;</l>

                        <l n="39">He sought the headquarters for all of the noise</l>
                        <l n="40">And there he discovered a great crowd of boys,</l>
                        <l n="41">All seated at tables and whooping it up</l>
                        <l n="42">While quenching their thirst from a big loving-cup,</l>
                        <l n="43">Which never ran empty, though score upon score</l>
                        <l n="44">Drank deep and drank often and clamored for more.</l>
                        <l n="45">And strange to relate, as the cup went around,</l>
                        <l n="46">The old boys began to get up and expound;</l>
                        <l n="47">They laughed at the jokes and they joined in each song</l>
                        <l n="48">And if trouble was started they helped it along.</l>
                        <l n="49">For would you believe it, though some in that room</l>
                        <l n="50">Seemed old and decrepit and marked for the tomb,</l>
                        <l n="51">The magical cup took them back to their teens</l>
                        <l n="52">By some supernatural method or means;</l>
                        <l n="53">Until doctor, professor and lawyer and sage,</l>

                        <l n="59">The consul gave answer: &quot;To tell you the truth,</l>

                        <l n="5">Which rolled at dizzy onwardness</l>
                        <l n="6">Without the impulse of the harnessed steed;</l>

                        <l n="9">And closed my eyes against the tossing clouds</l>
                        <l n="10">Of vitrified disturbance, soot, dust,</l>
                        <l n="11">Tattered papyrus and all the medleyed rubbish</l>

                        <l n="16">Did run with bunches of anticipation</l>

                        <l n="24">Most solemnly and fearfully asseverate,</l>
                        <l n="25">There came to my ear, with never pause,</l>
                        <l n="26">A soft and hollow rattle.</l>
                        <l n="27">At times, methought, &apos;twas like the</l>
                        <l n="28">Spilling of many dead men&apos;s bones</l>
                        <l n="29">In the adjoining vault. Again,</l>
                        <l n="30">It seemed more like the tapping</l>
                        <l n="31">Of distant castanets a dream</l>
                        <l n="32">Of dark-eyed Spanish women, soiled and superb,</l>
                        <l n="33">Who moved in jerky measures while</l>
                        <l n="34">The yellow dust rose to obscure</l>
                        <l n="35">The fierce colors. But, truth to tell,</l>
                        <l n="36">&apos;Twas neither. Clickety-click, clickety-click,</l>
                        <pb id="VAA2421-092" n="85"/>
                        <l n="37">I heard it yet again, and I asked:</l>
                        <l n="38">&quot;Is this some dread distemper of the brain,</l>
                        <l n="39">Some fungus growth in my imaginings?</l>
                        <l n="40">Do I alone of mortal men distinguish</l>
                        <l n="41">This smothered clatter, hidden, elusive?"</l>
                        <l n="42">When I did full relate my fears</l>
                        <l n="43">To the good sculapius, he said:</l>
                        <l n="44">&quot;Fear not; &apos;twas actual sound you heard,</l>
                        <l n="45">And you are not, as you might well suppose,</l>
                        <l n="46">Entirely separated from your trolley.&quot;</l>
                        <l n="47">Continuing, then, with kindly air, he told:&quot;</l>
                        <l n="48">The tiny rattling sounds which do attend</l>
                        <l n="49">You and all others in this wintry clime,</l>
                        <l n="50">Are the concussions of the quinine pellet</l>
                        <l n="51">Tossing within its pasteboard cage;</l>
                        <l n="52">For know you well that all men,</l>
                        <l n="53">Likewise the women and the tender young,</l>
                        <l n="54">The aged and infirm no more than those</l>

                        <l n="62">Their woolen garments, toward the Jaeger depths,</l>
                        <l n="63">Muffled and yet distinct, and always rhythmical,</l>

                        <l n="1">Within a house of public entertainment</l>
                        <l n="2">There sat an ebon slave close at the foot</l>
                        <l n="3">Of a heavy chair topping a broad dais.</l>
                        <l n="4">The man sat motionless, gazing pensive</l>
                        <l n="5">At nothingness, yet all the while</l>
                        <l n="6">He thought of numbers. Thus to sit</l>
                        <l n="7">And think was, so his master averred,</l>
                        <l n="8">One of the best things he did.</l>
                        <l n="9">While he was so benumbed and lost</l>
                        <l n="10">In fruitless meditation, there came,</l>
                        <l n="11">Stepping heavily and breathing most loud,</l>
                        <l n="12">A traveler in gay attire, who chanced to be</l>
                        <l n="13">At this, the period of our simple tale,</l>
                        <l n="14">The custodian, guard, manager, executor,</l>
                        <l n="15">Captain, director and immediate chief</l>
                        <l n="16">Of a comely and well-developed jag.</l>
                        <l n="17">With a proprietary and assertive air</l>
                        <l n="18">He climbed into the seat of honor,</l>
                        <l n="19">And, with thick utterance, and, be it said,</l>
                        <l n="20">A slack politeness, bade the Senegambian</l>
                        <l n="21">Remove from his sandals all trace of stain</l>
                        <l n="22">Or disfiguration. Promptly the youth obeyed,</l>
                        <l n="23">And when his tack was ended</l>
                        <pb id="VAA2421-094" n="87"/>
                        <l n="24">The generous traveler laid within</l>
                        <l n="25">The dusky palm a silver quartern,</l>
                        <l n="26">And, with yammering utterance, asked</l>
                        <l n="27">The simple child of Afric&apos; far transported</l>
                        <l n="28">To lead him to the harber&apos;s velvet seat.</l>
                        <l n="29">Lying at ease within the odored room,</l>
                        <l n="30">He slept in peace the while he yet received</l>
                        <l n="31">Kindly caresses and vapory ablution.</l>
                        <l n="32">Roused and sent forth, he viewed,</l>
                        <l n="33">As he stepped high to pass the threshold,</l>
                        <l n="34">The ebon youth once more contemplative</l>
                        <l n="35">And talking to himself. &quot;What ho!&quot;</l>
                        <l n="36">The liquorish pilgrim cried, &quot;What ho!</l>
                        <l n="37">Attend upon me! Help me to the chair!&quot;</l>
                        <l n="38">With mercenary speed the youth obeyed;</l>
                        <l n="39">With honeyed words he answered all the taunts</l>
                        <l n="40">And alcoholic cracks. Again he cleansed</l>
                        <l n="41">The scandals, which, ere he began a second time</l>
                        <l n="42">To cleanse, shone bright as any cuirass.</l>
                        <l n="43">With simulated humbleness he bowed</l>
                        <l n="44">As he received once more a silver piece;</l>
                        <l n="45">Then, with a gentleness which well</l>
                        <l n="46">Bespoke a tender and a helpful disposition,</l>
                        <l n="47">He led the traveler back into the shop</l>
                        <l n="48">And spread him on a chair.</l>
                        <l n="49">&quot;A shave!&quot; huskily cried the stranger,</l>
                        <l n="50">Then lapsed he into deep forgetfulness,</l>
                        <l n="51">Until they shook him rudely and collected.</l>
                        <pb id="VAA2421-095" n="88"/>
                        <l n="52">Now once again behold the jag-ged man,</l>
                        <l n="53">Pallid with powder, reeking with hammamelis,</l>
                        <l n="54">Seeking, circuitously and with serpentine</l>
                        <l n="55">Meanderings to find the door leading to the place</l>
                        <l n="56">Where he could have his sandals cleaned.&quot;</l>
                        <l n="57">Thrice welcome!&quot; cried the ebon youth, merrily,</l>
                        <l n="58">Boosting him, meanwhile, to the throne.</l>
                        <l n="59">What visions filled th&apos; Ethiopian&apos;s brain</l>
                        <l n="60">Of pork chops, chicken, carmine neckwear</l>
                        <l n="61">And the blood raw! With dreamy eyes</l>
                        <l n="62">The pilgrim gazed upon the busy slave and tried,</l>
                        <l n="63">With uncertain effort, to recall where</l>
                        <l n="64">Or when he had seen that face before.</l>
                        <l n="65">Thus dimly balmed in thought, he</l>
                        <l n="66">Closed his eyes and soon thereafter drooped</l>
                        <l n="67">And rolled must calmly to the floor below.</l>
                        <l n="68">Now see him, under the brawny arm</l>
                        <l n="69">Of the Celt, attending as house policeman,</l>
                        <l n="70">Carried to where the wind blows free;</l>
                        <l n="71">And the ebon youth, sad and regretful,</l>
                        <l n="72">Philosophizing among the dead embers of hope,</l>
                        <l n="73">Recalling that in this vale of disappointment</l>
                        <l n="74">A good thing comes and seems inclined to stay</l>
                        <l n="75">&apos;Till Fate shows up and chases it away.</l>

                        <l n="19">&quot;To stand or not to stand?</l>
                        <l n="20">That is the question:</l>
                        <l n="21">Whether &apos;tis nobler in a man to suffer</l>
                        <l n="22">The crampy leg aches and the jolty motion</l>
                        <l n="23">Or to take chances with the heavy female</l>
                        <l n="24">And oust the dog?&quot;</l>
                        <l n="25">Not overlong he waited, for he knew</l>
                        <l n="26">That sweet diplomacy might win a cause</l>
                        <l n="27">Which harsh attack would lose.</l>
                        <l n="28">Gently he lifted then the limber brute</l>
                        <l n="29">And sat he where the dog had sat before,</l>
                        <l n="30">And to the matron&apos;s cold astonishment</l>
                        <pb id="VAA2421-097" n="90"/>
                        <l n="31">He turned a smile, oily and melting</l>
                        <l n="32">In its sublime benevolence.</l>
                        <l n="33">Upon his knee he held the dog, stroking,</l>
                        <l n="34">With unpracticed hand, the wiry coat,</l>
                        <l n="35">And then he spoke. &quot;Madam,&quot; quoth he</l>
                        <l n="36">Full many a league, in this and foreign lands,</l>
                        <l n="37">Have I, your servant, wandered,</l>
                        <l n="38">But never in my wide perambulations</l>
                        <l n="39">Have I beheld a dog of any breed</l>
                        <l n="40">More pleasing to my eye than this one.&quot;</l>
                        <l n="41">&quot;Twas a judicious lie, for well he knew</l>
                        <l n="42">The cur had neither pedigree nor value.&quot;</l>
                        <l n="43">&quot;Listen!&quot; he said. &quot;In my far-distant
                            home</l>
                        <l n="44">I have a niece, a dimpled little thing,</l>
                        <l n="45">Who craves a true companion.</l>
                        <l n="46">If I could take this dog to her</l>
                        <l n="47">Methinks I now can hear her cry with joy</l>
                        <l n="48">And note her glad amazement.</l>
                        <l n="49">This dog I must possess, and now,</l>
                        <l n="50">In furtherance of what I most desire,</l>
                        <l n="51">I offer you one hundred dollars for him.&quot;</l>
                        <l n="52">Delight and fright worked for supremacy</l>
                        <l n="53">Within the ample figure of that dame.</l>
                        <l n="54">Moved by the subtle flattery she was,</l>
                        <l n="55">And yet alarmed to know that any one</l>
                        <l n="56">Should covet thus her chief possession.</l>
                        <l n="57">&quot;Alas, I dare not part with him,&quot; she said.</l>
                        <l n="58">&quot;My husband loves him. Should I now return</l>
                        <pb id="VAA2421-098" n="91"/>
                        <l n="59">Without the household pet</l>
                        <l n="60">&apos;Twould wrench his heart.&quot;</l>
                        <l n="61">"What say you then to fifty dollars more?&quot;</l>
                        <l n="62">Urged the persistent one. &quot;My niece,</l>
                        <l n="63">My little, bright-eyed darling relative,</l>
                        <l n="64">Must have this dog.&quot;</l>
                        <l n="65">&quot;Tempt me not!&quot; cried the woman,</l>
                        <l n="66">And speaking thus she gazed</l>
                        <l n="67">More infinitely fond than e&apos;;er before</l>
                        <l n="68">Upon the five. &quot;I&apos;ll give two
                            hundred.&quot;</l>
                        <l n="69">&quot;Ah, now, methinks, you play upon my
                            avarice,&quot;</l>
                        <l n="70">The woman said. &quot;At the next station</l>
                        <l n="71">I must leave you. Better than life itself</l>
                        <l n="72">I love this little dog; but thenalack-a-day!</l>
                        <l n="73">Two hundred takes him!&quot;</l>
                        <l n="74">&quot;Good! He is mine! One word, however,</l>
                        <l n="75">Relating to the terms of this transaction.</l>
                        <l n="76">Two hundred dollars is the price I give,</l>
                        <l n="77">But not in paltry gold or silver, mind you.&quot;</l>
                        <l n="78">&quot;What, then?&quot; she asked, and as she spoke</l>
                        <l n="79">The whistle blew the signal for the station.</l>
                        <l n="80">&quot;With your permission, madam, I will pay</l>
                        <l n="81">In Maltese cats worth eighty dollars each.&quot;</l>
                        <l n="82">Too full of wrath to answer him</l>
                        <l n="83">She fled, pressing the dear one to her bosom.</l>
                        <l n="84">The ancient joker watched her mad retreat</l>
                        <l n="85">And said, &quot;I lose the dog but keep the
                            seat.&quot;</l>
